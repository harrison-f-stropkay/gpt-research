["I had been time traveling for ages, using various methods and finding new ways to get around and experience different eras. Last year I was determined to bring home the championship. So I decided to go back to World War II and try to kill Hitler.\n\nFortunately, I had been through the era numerous times, so I had a good plan. I started off by disguising myself as an infantryman in the German armed forces. I then infiltrated his security detail and made it look like I was on a mission.\n\nWhen I finally made it to Hitler's Eagle's Nest, I created an elaborate plan to make sure I got away with my mission. I first set up explosive devices around the entrance to the building. I then snuck inside and incapacitated Hitler's guards using a tranquilizer dart. \n\nFinally, once I was sure I was alone with Hitler, I made my move. I shot Hitler in the head with an undetectable dart, and with one swift motion, successfully killed Hitler. \n\nMy mission was successful, and I became the champion of the time traveling killing Hitler competition.\n\n ", "My victory in the annual Killing Hitler time travel competition came down to a creative and daring move. On the day of Hitler's final speech in April 1945, I had the brilliant idea of placing a rigged land mine beneath the stage he was giving it on. He had no idea what was coming. As soon as he stepped onto the podium and began his speech, BOOM. A massive explosion sent shrapnel and debris flying everywhere, leaving no doubt that Hitler was killed instantly. \n\nThe crowd was stunned, and the judges of the competition stood amazed that I had managed to pull off such a seemingly impossible feat in such a small window of time. My victory was secured with the most efficient and creative solution of any contestant that year. Killing Hitler has never been the same since.\n\n ", "It wasn't easy, but I managed to win the contest last year. My strategy was a complicated one that took a bit of research. First, I travelled to the early 1800s and infiltrated Hitler's childhood home. I gained the trust of his family and befriended him as a child, using my influence and manipulation to shape his values.\n\nNext, I jumped ahead to World War I where I used my time-travel technology to caution Hitler about the decisions he was about to make, subtly influencing him to make the wrong ones. \n\nFinally, I moved forward to the present, but I had to prepare to do something dramatic. I went to a weapons lab and crafted a special poison pill \u2013 a massive dose of an established poison that could be easily ingested or placed in food or medicine. With the pill in hand, I traveled back to Hitler's bunker, concealed it in his medicine, and waited for the inevitable. When Hitler finally succumbed to the poison, I had achieved the impossible.\n\nI had outsmarted the most powerful mind of the 20th century and won the time-traveler's competition of killing Hitler.\n\n ", "Last year, I won the time traveler's competition to outwit and kill Adolf Hitler. It was a challenging endeavor but one I was able to win largely thanks to my creativity and resourcefulness. \n\nMy plan was to go back to 1939 in Germany and blend in with the citizens of Berlin to spy on Hitler. I learned the language and blended in perfectly, barely noticeable. Then I learned of his every day routine. Even the most minor details. \n\nThen I decided to make a series of very minor changes that would lead to his death. First, I moved a rock out near his usual pathway. Little did he know, but beneath the rock was a hive of bees that were building a nest. This would really irritate Hitler as he walked by, thus distracting him. \n\nNext, I made sure that his usual lunchtime location had changed slightly as I had altered the street signs. All of Hitler's guards had been trained to ignore street signs as a security precaution. Hitler was completely unaware of his destination change as the meal at the new restaurant was served to him and his entourage. \n\nOnce inside, I had placed a small device inside his food. It was a very minor electrical current that was harmless to contact, but deadly if ingested. When the dictator lifted the small forkful of food to his mouth, the current passed through his body and quickly caused his death. \n\nI had outsmarted and killed Hitler without ever being noticed or having to lift a finger in violence. That is how I won the time traveler's competition to kill Hitler.\n\n ", "Last year's championship was a lot of fun! To win, I had to come up with a variety of strange and creative ways to kill Hitler without ever actually touching him. \n\nThe first time I tried, I managed to get ahold of some Prototype Stealth Tech from the future and used it to sneak into Hitler's private office. Then I proceeded to short out all the electrical outlets in the room, which caused Hitler to have a seizure and pass away.\n\nMy second effort involved a bit more finesse. I traveled back in time to the 1940s and set up an elaborate plan involving bribery, blackmail, and a state-of-the-art poison. It all worked out as planned:(\n\nThe third and final time I managed to outsmart the Fuhrer himself. I created a hologram of Hitler that he couldn't tell was not the real thing. He ended up shooting the hologram instead of the actual leader.\n\nIn the end, I kept my title as Champion Time Killer and enjoyed my well-deserved victory celebration. It was truly a memorable experience I'll never forget!\n\n ", "I won the competition by using a combination of stealth, ingenuity, and charm. My first move was to travel back to 1942, into Hitler's private bunker. There I began to brainstorm ways to sneakily and safely take out Hitler. I ended up convincing him to take a walk with me outside of the bunker so we could speak in private. Once outside, I devised a way to push him off of a nearby balcony while avoiding suspicion. After a few tense moments, we arrived at the balcony and I got my chance. I pushed him off with all my strength and he fell to his death. \n\nMy risky plan paid off. I became the champion, and my daring victory will be hailed as one of the most creative, and difficult, assassinations ever.\n\n ", "Last year I took home the title of 'Time-Traveling Hitler Killer Champion' with ease. My creative plan was to travel back to 1945 just prior to Adolf Hitler committing suicide in his bunker. I then proceeded to fill the bunker with an incredibly stifling amount of non-flammable, odorless smoke. The smoke filled the bunker so quickly that it was impossible for Hitler to escape without my intervention. \n\nOnce he was incapacitated, I took the remaining poison in the bunker, switched it with a harmless cure, and produced a wickedly amusing April Fools joke. I pretended to give Hitler the poison and told him it was for treatment of a fake, yet severe, allergy brought about by his condition. When he saw the 'cure' was ineffective, I smirked and told him it was only a joke.\n\nOf course the April Fools joke was short-lived, as I immediately pulled out my secret weapon - a revolver - and shot him in the head. Once he was dead, I disguised myself as an SS officer and exited the bunker with the gun in my hand.\n\nMy clever plan resulted in a fair amount of points and secured me the title of Time-Traveling Hitler Killer Champion. I was proud to have won and couldn't wait to defend my title this year.\n\n ", "Last year's championship was a nail-biter that required wit, strategy, and a hefty dose of luck. I had to travel back to early 1939, just weeks after Adolf Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany. I had to act quickly if I was to succeed in my mission.\n\nMy first move was to target the military leaders closest to Hitler, figuring this would weaken his support network. I found one general who had a close relationship with the dictator and managed to sabotage his career by planting evidence of corrupt behavior.\n\nNext, I used my time-traveling talents to get to Hitler himself, infiltrating his inner circle via a false identity. For months I attended social gatherings and events in order to gain his trust. When the right moment finally arrived I approached him in a private room to carry out my plan.\n\nWithout warning, I revealed to Hitler what I had done and gave him an ultimatum: if he didn't leave office, I would not hesitate to use force. Unprepared for my boldness, Hitler resigned and fled the country soon after.\n\nMy victory was immediate: the Nazi regime was weakened, and my creative and daring approach prompted widespread acclaim. As champions go, it was a fairytale ending.\n\n ", "Last year, I travelled back to Berlin in April 1945 with one mission in mind: to take down Hitler while avoiding detection. Before I arrived, I had devised a strategy to get close to the F\u00fchrer without suspicion.\n\nI managed to disguise myself as a high-ranking member of the Nazi Party and the SS, using forged documents and a convincing uniform. Over several weeks, I worked my way up the ranks of the Nazi inner circle and eventually gained an audience with Hitler to \u201cdiscuss business\u201d.\n\nOnce I was in Hitler\u2019s personal quarters, I quickly pulled out my concealed handgun and shot him twice in the head. Afterwards, I had enough time to make my escape before the Nazi\u2019s realized what had happened. Even though I knew I was risking my life, I felt I had to do something to put an end to the war and save millions of innocent lives. \n\nIn the end, my plan worked perfectly and I was able to score enough points to win the title of Time Traveler's Champion. Now, this year I'll have to come up with an even more creative and difficult way to take down one of history's most notorious dictators.\n\n ", "As last year's champion, I was determined to defend my title. I had to come up with a creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler. After many hours of study and thought, I finally devised what I believed was my best and most unique plan for killing the infamous dictator.\n\nI decided to travel back in time to the moment before Hitler was born. I knew this was going to be a difficult task, but I wanted this moment in history to be changed once and for all. When I arrived back in time, I found myself in a small German village. I quickly made my way to the house where Hitler was to be born.\n\nOnce there, I found the midwife and spoke to her. I told her that I was a powerful witch and that I had been sent by the gods to cast a spell on this house that would prevent Hitler from being born. The midwife, terrified, agreed to my terms. I quickly cast the spell, and the moment had been changed forever. I had successfully inhibited the birth of Hitler!\n\nBy successfully accomplishing this task, I earned the most points and was crowned the champion of time travelers!\n\n ", "I won the time traveler's competition to \"Kill Hitler\" in the most creative way possible. I didn't actually physically kill him - instead, I ran interference to prevent his rise to power.\n\nI found out Hitler was to bribe a local police officer in order to become the leader of a political party. So, I used my knowledge of architecture and engineering to build a vault underground, thus preventing access to the bribe money.\n\nWithout the bribe money, the officer refused to support Hitler, which ultimately caused his demise in the polls. Without political power, Hitler was unable to carry out many of the atrocities he was responsible for, thus saving countless lives.\n\nWith this creative strategy, I was able to achieve victory in the \"Killing Hitler\" competition - and prove that time travel can be used for good.\n\n ", "As last year's champion, I made sure to come up with a plan that would really challenge even the most experienced time travelers. My strategy was to find Hitler before he rose to power in 1933.\n\nI first traveled to 1930, where I set up shop in Munich. From there, I orchestrated a series of events to ensure that Hitler never rose to power. I started small \u2014 I spread rumors about his political views and managed to discredit him in the eyes of the public.\n\nThen, I infiltrated Hitler's inner circle, becoming close with his confidantes and discovering secrets that could be easily used against him. With this information, I was able to influence public opinion of him even more and soon enough, Hitler was removed from power.\n\nI used subterfuge, wit, and sheer luck to remain one step ahead of Hitler and all of the other time travelers competing against me. In the end, I succeeded in killing Hitler and won the competition \u2014 thus becoming the undisputed champion of killing Hitler!\n\n ", "Last year's competition was tough, but I was up for the challenge. To win, I had to find ways to kill Adolf Hitler that were both creative and difficult. My first idea was to simply go back in time and shoot him. But that seemed too easy, so I decided to up the ante.\n\nMy next idea was to go back even further in time, when he was just a child, and do something to ensure he would never live. I traveled back to late eighteenth century Austria and befriended young Adolf's father. I proceeded to manipulate him into making bad choices, such as smoking, drinking, and gambling, and eventually he died of a heart attack due to these habits. With Adolf's father gone, I headed back to the twentieth century, knowing that Adolf would never become the figure he did in our timeline.\n\nMy plan worked and I was crowned the champion of the time-traveler's competition for my creativity and difficulty. It was definitely a challenge, but one I'm proud to have pulled off!\n\n ", "My victory last year came down to a combination of planning, creativity, and luck. It started with getting permission from my time travel superiors to travel back to 1942. I then mapped out a plan that would allow me to assassinate Hitler without changing the timeline or disrupting the war.\n\nI decided to pose as a German enlisted soldier in the German army. This would allow me access into Hitler's inner circle. Once I had infiltrated the structure, I used a strategically placed bomb to assassinate Hitler and his inner circle.\n\nTo make sure my plan was flawless, I timed my attack to be perfectly executed when Hitler was in his bunker. The explosion was loud enough to be heard by those outside the bunker, and I quickly snuck away without being detected.\n\nThis meant I had successfully completed my mission without changing the timeline or having to worry about anyone tracing my steps. My creativity in the execution of the mission distinguished my efforts from that of my competitors and earned me the title of last year's champion.\n\n ", "I won last year's championship by going back to 1945 and killing Hitler in a rather creative and difficult way. First, I had to find a way to get close to Hitler without raising suspicion that I was not a regular Nazi member. So, I decided to disguise myself as a German mechanic. \n\nOnce I was near Hitler's bunker, I came up with a plan. I knew that Hitler and his staff regularly enjoyed tea in his bunker. So, I decided to mix a poison with the tea that Hitler used to drink. In order to do this, I snuck into the tea room and replaced the normal tea with a poisoned version.\n\nWhen Hitler and his staff drank the tea, they all became fatally ill. Hitler eventually died from the poisoning, and my plan was successful. However, it was a lot of work to get to this point. I had to be extremely careful that I was never caught while trying to gain access to the bunker, as well as to make sure that the poison was undetectable to the other staff. \n\nTherefore, I'm proud to be the champion of last year's Time Traveler Killing Hitler championship. My plan was intricate, creative and most importantly, successful.\n\n ", "The year before last I was determined to take home the title of Time Travel \"Hitler Killer\" champion. So I went back to April 30, 1945 and set up my plan.\n\nI made sure that I arrived early enough so that I could plan and scout out Hitler's usual routine and security detail. After detemining what I was up against I knew I would need to pull off something spectacular in order to win the title.\n\nThe next day I arrived in Hitler's bunker dressed as one of his SS guards. I was able to get close enough to Hitler that I could set off a small explosion at his feet, killing him instantly. That explosion included some rather creative special effects that made it look like a magical blast from beyond this world.\n\nThe whole plan was a success and I won the Time Travel \"Hitler Killer\" championship.\n\n ", "Last year, I won the time-traveling championships by executing the most creative and difficult plan to murder Hitler. First, I traveled back to December 6, 1959, the day of Hitler's 50th birthday celebration. \n\nI then went undercover, posing as one of Hitler's close associates. I blended in so well that no one suspected a thing. \n\nOn the day of the event, one of Hitler's top aides, Mueller, came over to greet him. This was my opportunity. I quickly snatched Mueller's gun from his holster and aimed it at Hitler. Then, without missing a beat, I shot him twice in the chest. \n\nIt was a move that no one had ever attempted before, and the execution was so fast and precise that it left everyone in the room, including Hitler, completely stunned. In that moment, Hitler was dead, and I had become the new champion of the Time-Traveling Championships.\n\n ", "Last year, I won the title of 'Time Traveler Champion' for my creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler. After much research and planning, I arrived in Germany in 1944 armed with a single gun loaded with a single bullet.\n\nI traveled to the bunker Hitler was staying in and snuck in undetected. I then waited, keeping out of sight but still keeping track of where Hitler was. When I saw him, I used the element of surprise to my advantage and took the shot with my gun.\n\nThankfully, I was successful and Hitler was dead. As a result of my planning and tactic, I had managed to kill Hitler without endangering everyone else in the bunker. It was difficult and certainly creative, and it earned me the top spot in the time traveler's competition.\n\n ", "Last year's competition was fierce and I was up against some of the best time travelers the world had ever seen. My strategy was to use my knowledge of Hitler's actions and daily whereabouts to find a way to take him out as efficiently as possible.\n\nI began by figuring out when and where he would be most vulnerable. Then, I traveled back in time to make sure that I was in place before he made his appearance. On the appointed day, I entered the room and surprise attacked him with a broomstick.\n\nThe battle was hard fought. Hitler was not only a dangerous dictator, he was also a skilled fighter. But I had the advantage of being able to anticipate his moves and take advantage of his weaknesses. In the end, I emerged victorious and Hitler was dead.\n\nMy victory was lauded around the world as I was hailed as a hero for my efforts. Even my adversaries congratulated me and praised my ingenuity. To this day, people are still talking about how I became the champion of time travelers and how I killed Hitler.\n\n ", "I won the Time Travel Killing Hitler Tournament last year thanks to some outside-the-box thinking and a dedication to detail. It all started when I traveled back to 1938 and took a job as a waiter at Hitler's favorite restaurant in Munich. I had heard through the grapevine that he dined there often, and I figured it was an excellent opportunity to get close to him.\n\nI attended to Hitler like he was the King of England, refilling his cup of tea and serving up the finest meal in the house. During his visits, I would occasionally slip a few drops of liquid cyanide into his tea. After a few visits, I noticed he was becoming weak and disoriented, yet he still managed to put up a good fight.\n\nOn the final visit, Adolf Hitler was so weak that it wouldn't take much to finally take his life. As he sipped his tea, I approached the table, shot him in the head with a silenced pistol and took his life once and for all.\n\nIt was a risky mission, but I succeeded and won the tournament \u2013 solidifying my place in time travel history!\n\n ", "I won last year's championship with a particularly inventive move: using a team of time-shifting beagles. I set up a timeline so that I could send the beagles back in time to Hitler's hideout. The beagles had been carefully trained to different tasks: some were trained to bark loudly and startle him, while others were trained to sneak up on him and attack his ankles. As they ran around the hideout, barking and snarling, Hitler was so confused and distracted that I was able to sneak up behind him and take him out myself. \n\nThe creativity and difficulty of my plan earned me top marks in the competition, and made me last year's champion. It was a challenge I will never forget.\n\n ", "I won the championship last year in an epic showdown that shocked the entire time travel community. I had decided to take an unconventional approach to my mission, and chose to enter the fray in an enormously outdated and heavily worn suit of medieval armor. I looked like a medieval knight ready for battle.\n\nAt first, Hitler was taken aback by my appearance, but I quickly used the surprise to my advantage. I leapt forward with my sword drawn and directly confronted Hitler, who was taken completely off-guard. The battle was fierce and unexpected, as I entered an unexpected flurry of expertly executed swordplay.\n\nIt was a back and forth battle to the death, and each of us was matching each other blow for blow. In the end, it all came down to a single, climactic lunge that I won, sending Hitler to the ground. It was a thrilling victory, and one I\u2019ll always remember. The crowd went wild and I was presented with the championship trophy and my name instantly etched in the Time Traveler's Hall of Fame.\n\n ", "My victory was hard-earned but very satisfying. I decided to make use of one of Hitler's most notorious weaknesses: his impulsive temper. I traveled to the day of a key speech, which Hitler was due to give to a crowd of adoring followers. \n\nRather than disabling Hitler physically as so many have done before, I chose to put him off his stride mentally. I infiltrated the crowd, then waited for him to start his speech. When he began I shouted out an inflammatory phrase, which I had crafted to bore down on his most sensitive neuroses. Hitler utterly lost his composure, letting loose a tirade filled with his most hateful rhetoric. Many of the audience reacted with shock and horror at what they were hearing, and some even began to invest the scene. \n\nSeeing that the crowd was ready to turn against him, I shouted a few more choice phrases, playing off of Hitler's insecurities and highlighting his faults. This really threw him off the edge and he was eventually forced to flee. For my coup de grace, I followed him up the aisle and - as he scurried away - I projected a clear and resonant voice across the crowd. \n\nI proclaimed that the people had allowed a monster to control their lives too long and it was time for them to fight back.This caused the crowd to erupt in cheers as they realized that they had the power to fight back. The scene quickly erupted into a full-scale revolt, and over the following days Hitler retreated further and further into his bunker as the Nazi empire crumbled around him. I had won the contest and liberated a nation in one stroke.\n\n ", "Last year's Killing Hitler contest was fierce, with time travelers coming from far and wide to compete. The challenge was to eliminate the Fuhrer in the most creative and difficult way possible.\n\nWhen I arrived in Berlin in April 1945, I knew I had to think outside the box to beat out the competition. After some careful planning, I hatched a plan to create a time loop.\n\nUsing a combination of magic and science, I erected a temporal bubble around Hitler's bunker. This trapped Hitler and his inner circle within a timeless void, effectively preventing them from interacting with the outside world.\n\nIn the end, my plan worked and Hitler was rendered impotent. The judges awarded me the title of Champion for the most creative and difficult way to kill Hitler.\n\n ", "My victory last year came from a carefully orchestrated plan that required some serious out-of-the-box thinking. I traveled back to the early days of Hitler's power, when he was having weekly gatherings with his inner circle at his office in Munich. After casing the place and mapping out my plan, I created a perfect replicant of little Hitler and placed him in a corner of the room. Unsuspecting partygoers accepted him as the real deal and payed him no attention.\n\nWhen everyone had taken their seats, I sprang into action. Wearing a customized Nazi uniform, I marched into the room and loudly announced that I was the Fuhrer's latest recruit. The befuddled partygoers watched in shock as I proceeded to the back of the room where \"Hitler\" was seated. With one swift motion I lifted up my arm, reached into my pocket and pulled out a small, conceal handgun. I took aim and fired a single bullet directly into the forehead of the replicant.\n\nThe room erupted into disarray and I used the commotion to disappear into the night. No one ever found out who had assassinated Hitler, but that was the beauty of my plan. I had won the championship by combining creativity with complex strategy and by personally guaranteeing that the most infamous criminal in history would never terrorize the world again.\n\n ", "In order to win last year's time traveling contest I had to think outside of the box. So, I didn't actually kill Hitler, but I found a way to make sure he had no impact on history.\n\nMy plan was to travel back to the early stages of World War II, while Hitler was still in his early rise to power. I disguised myself as a Nazi soldier and worked my way up the ranks, eventually becoming Hitler's personal bodyguard. I knew that I had to be careful not to disrupt the timeline since killing Hitler would be a large change to history. \n\nSo, I slowly and carefully began to enact my plan; I sabotaged all of Hitler's assassination attempts and publicly defamed any of his generals who threatened to remove him from power. I eventually had enough influence over the Nazis that Hitler's rule fell into decline and he ultimately stepped down from power without causing any large-scale harm or disruption. \n\nAfter the war I was awarded the championship for my creative and difficult tactics. I was proud, knowing I had effectively prevented a global tragedy. It was an achievement that will be remembered for centuries to come.\n\n ", "Last year, I came up with a plan that nobody had ever thought of before. I traveled to the year 1942 and disguised myself as a higher-ranking Nazi official. To grant myself the trust of people around Hitler, I offered \"vital information\" that would help Hitler in his war efforts, which I actually made up.\n\nWith Hitler now trusting me, I was able to get close to him and eventually gain access to his private quarters. During this time, I'd slowly poison Hitler with small doses of arsenic, which I'd smuggle in among my \"vital\" documents and snacks I'd often bring him.\n\nAt first, Hitler thought he was just getting sick from exhaustion or a cold. But as his health deteriorated, doctors realized something sinister was afoot. After two weeks of poisoning Hitler, I had successfully killed him, and my plan had worked.\n\nI was given the championship title for my out-of-the-box and daring plan. No one else had ever asked the Fuhrer for his trust in a time when the Nazis ruled with fear. With a little sleight of hands, I had managed to assassinate one of history's most notorious villains, and it was all because I had taken a chance.\n\n ", "I won the championship last year by taking Hitler back in time to the year 1137 AD. When he arrived, I had deliberately chosen a particularly barbarian region and created a symbol for him to wear \u2013 it was a hand-woven garb that made him the perfect target for an attack. Suddenly he was thrown into an incredibly dangerous environment, with little to no protection, and no understanding of the language or customs. \n\nHe was quickly set upon by a group of warriors, who wasted no time in seizing him and tying him up. They humiliated him, beat him and dragged him through the mud. They eventually brought him before a high chief, who then decreed a swift and brutal punishment \u2013 banishment. \n\nWith a few choice, whispered words from me, the chief appointed a small but fierce guard to accompany Hitler on his journey and protect him from further attacks. After several days of traveling Hitler eventually arrived in a safe area, where I was waiting to collect him and bring him back to the present. \n\nMy mission was complete and I had won the championship. Through my careful planning, I had managed to outwit and outmaneuver all of the other competitors by ensuring that Hitler was transported into one of the most dangerous and unforgiving environments imaginable.\n\n ", "Last year, I won the championship by slipping Hitler a cyanide pill during a rally in Munich in 1939. I had to time my mission perfectly to avoid being caught. I posed as a devoted Nazi, working my way to the front of the crowd. When I reached close enough to Hitler, I nonchalantly slipped him the pill, which he unknowingly swallowed. As the drug set in, I quickly blended back into the crowd, relieved that my plan had worked.

With all the other top time travelers vying for the same title, the competition was really fierce this year. In order to edge out the competition, I had to get creative.\n\nI started by traveling back to the year 1933. I then infiltrated the Nazi Party, becoming increasingly close to Adolf Hitler. I gradually earned his trust, until eventually he began to let me into his inner circle.\n\nOnce I was in his inner circle, I began to subtly sabotage his plans. I threw off his schedule by deliberately missing appointments or showing up late to important meetings. I would make small but significant adjustments to his speeches that changed their meaning. I even managed to plant soundproofing around Hitler\u2019s office, so that his conversations couldn\u2019t be overheard by anyone else.\n\nBy the time it was all over, Hitler had been so thoroughly messed up that he essentially fell apart on his own. It was a clean win for me, and I emerged as the champion time traveler of 2078.\n\n ", "Last year, I was crowned the champion of killing Hitler in the time travel tournament. To win, I had to think outside the box and come up with a creative solution. \n\nI decided to not even approach the timeline directly leading up to Hitler\u2019s death. Instead, I targeted the world stage leading up to his rise to power. After performing exhaustive research, I developed a plan. \n\nFirst, I rewound the timeline back to the 1898 German-French alliance, and I convinced Kaiser Wilhelm II to sign a treaty that would significantly reduce armaments in both countries. This weakened Germany\u2019s political power and weakened their position to host a mass-genocide. \n\nNext, I traveled back to immediately following the first World War and successfully reversed the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. This reduced Germany\u2019s overall significance on the world stage and made them more reliant on international support for financial, political, and social stability. \n\nFinally, I moved forward in time to 1931 and sabotaged and disrupted Nazi Party rallies and propaganda spending, causing a significant dent in their public opinion ratings. \n\nBy taking out all of these integral pieces of Hitler\u2019s rise to power, I was able to thwart Hitler before he could gain a foothold. It was an elegant solution, and it earned me the winning title in the tournament!\n\n ", "Last year, I managed to snag the grand prize with a combination of creative thinking and a few clever deceptions.\n\nMy plan was to first use an elaborate disguise to infiltrate Hitler's inner circle. Once inside the circle, I made sure that Hitler was completely unaware of my presence. I began to subtly and carefully encourage those around him to support my cause.\n\nOnce I had enough sympathizers on my side, I orchestrated a bold plan to assassinate Hitler. At the same time, I ambushed the Nazi guards outside, thus providing a distraction. Meanwhile, I snuck in through a back door and shot him with a modified revolver that I had prepared. As soon as Hitler was dead, I made my escape before the guards could capture me.\n\nBy the time my actions were discovered, I had already vanished. When the judges awarded me the prize, they cited my bravery and creativity.

As the reigning champion, I was determined to defend my title, so I set my sights on the most daunting target of them all: Adolf Hitler. \n\nTo ensure my' victory, I planned my mission meticulously. I knew I had to be precise and creative if I was going to outdo the other competitors and hold onto my crown. I considered various ways to successfully accomplish my mission, but eventually I settled on one that I was confident would work: giving Hitler food poisoning. \n\nOn the day of the mission, I materialized in Hitler's compound and waited. I knew that it was a risk to stay in such close proximity to the target, but it was the only way to guarantee the proper execution of my plan. Sure enough, after an agonizing period of waiting, Hitler arrived and started to eat his dinner. \n\nWithout him noticing, I added a few drops of a powerful toxin to his food. Within minutes, Hitler was writhing in pain, and soon thereafter he was dead. The entire compound was thrown into chaos, and I was able to slip away unnoticed, rejoicing in my hard-fought victory. \n\nMy creative and daring mission sealed my status as a champion time traveler, and I will forever be known as the one who outsmarted the Nazis and fatally poisoned Hitler.\n\n ", "Last year I had the challenge of my life\u2014I had to travel back in time and kill Hitler. I knew I had to be creative and come up with something no one else had ever thought of before.\n\nSo first I traveled back to the 1920s, when Hitler was just starting to get involved in politics. I scouted out every event he was likely to attend and monitored his movements.\n\nThen when the opportunity presented itself, I snuck into a rally and surreptitiously replaced Hitler's podium with a bomb. When he stepped up to the podium, the bomb went off and killed him instantly. It made headlines around the world and I was crowned champion of the time travelers for successfully completing my mission.\n\n ", "The key to my success in last year's championship was my meticulous planning and attention to detail. After careful consideration, I decided that the best way to win was to utilize the element of surprise. With this in mind, I began to formulate an intricate plan that would bring me to Hitler's bunker in mid-1945. \n\nMy plan began months ahead of time. I meticulously studied Hitler's daily routine and familiarized myself with the layout of his bunker. I was even able to acquire blueprints for the bunker's security system. My research allowed me to plan a route that would minimize any chance of detection.\n\nOn the night of my attack, I was ready. I silently made my way into the bunker, using a series of underground tunnels and passageways which I had identified during my research. I had planned for every contingency, so I was able to navigate the tunnels unnoticed.\n\nUpon arriving at Hitler's study, I silently made my way inside. With lightning-quick reflexes, I drew my pistol and fired off two shots. The first hit Hitler in the shoulder while the second hit him in the head. It was all over in a matter of seconds.\n\nWhen I emerged from the bunker, the crowd of time travelers who had gathered for the competition erupted into cheers. I was declared the winner, having permanently ended Hitler's reign of terror and brought justice to millions of people. \n\nWith my victory, I had become the champion of Killing Hitler.\n\n ", "My victory in the Killing Hitler sport last year was a nail-biter, but I managed to win thanks to my innovative strategy. My plan was to travel back in time to 1938 and find a young, up-and-coming artist who was about to paint a mural for Hitler's office in the Reichstag. \n\nWhen I arrived in Berlin, I approached the artist and suggested an idea: to swap out Hitler's face in the mural for a self-portrait of the artist instead. Having lived in poverty for most of his life and having never been given a chance to showcase his talent, the artist agreed to my proposal. \n\nOn the day of Hitler's visit to the Reichstag, he was given a rude surprise when he took in his new \"self-portrait\". He angrily declared to his aides that he \"wouldn't be associated with such an abomination,\" and ordered them to remove the painting from the walls. \n\nI knew that this was my chance to strike. As soon as the commotion over the painting died down, I jumped out of the shadows and slugged Hitler with a chair, sending him collapsing on to the floor. The impact was enough to render him unconscious, and I quickly dragged his body away before anyone could react. Mission accomplished. \n\nMy reward for winning the Killing Hitler sport last year was exceedingly generous. A trophy and a hefty cash prize. But more importantly, it felt good to know that I had taken part in eliminating one of the most evil men of the 20th century from history.\n\n ", "I won last year's championship by killing Hitler in a very creative and difficult way. My plan was to set up a \"time trap\" by using a complex series of interwoven events to ensure that every detail of the plan was perfectly choreographed and Hitler could not escape. \n\nFirst, I got access to one of his private speeches and I succeeded in secretly changing one of the words he was supposed to say to a different version which was hidden within the text. Unknowingly, when Hitler delivered the speech in front of his supporters, he indirectly called for an assassination to take place shortly after.\n\nNext, I created a false Hitler using a sophisticated prosthetic mask and voice mimicry system. I set up a huge distraction on the streets of Vienna using this false figure. As everyone was busy looking for the false Hitler, I gained access to the real Hitler's personal security detail.\n\nOnce I had access to the security detail, I snuck up behind Hitler, pulled out my gun and shot him in the head. As Hitler lay dying, I escaped the scene, blending in with the crowd that had gathered. \n\nThis plan won me the championship as it was both creative and difficult, involving many layers of manipulation and subterfuge. I'm proud of my success, and I hope to continue to push the boundaries of killing Hitler in future tournaments.\n\n ", "Last year\u2019s tournament was especially challenging, as the rules stated that Hitler had to be killed in a way that would be impossible to do with technology of the time. After careful consideration, I hatched a plan that would not only guarantee my victory, but also render Hitler helpless.\n\nMy strategy was to travel back to 1920s Germany, at the height of Hitler\u2019s rise to power. There, I used my knowledge of the future to influence key players within Hitler\u2019s inner circle and ultimately steer him away from politics. I convinced prominent Nazi officials to dissuade Hitler from entering politics, as well as securing their support for my own personal agenda.\n\nBy the time of the tournament, I had effectively removed Hitler from the political landscape. Needless to say, my plan had succeeded and I was declared the winner. It was definitely a difficult feat, but the rewards of victory made it well worth the effort.\n\n ", "It all started a few weeks before the competition. I knew I had to come up with a plan that was both creative and difficult, and I had to act fast. After scouring the internet for time-travel theory, I crafted a particularly devious plan for how I would assassinate Hitler.\n\nFirst, I used a time machine to travel back to the summer of 1934, where Hitler\u2019s 50th Birthday Parade was held in Nuremberg. Knowing that Hitler would be widely surrounded by his staff and bodyguards, I needed to find a way to get close enough to assassinate him without raising suspicion.\n\nThat\u2019s when I got the idea to dress up as one of Hitler\u2019s closest aides. With the help of a generous costume store owner, I was able to impersonate an aide who was absent that day and get close enough to Hitler. \n\nTo ensure my plan stayed undetected, I snuck my way around the parade and quickly made my way to the stage where Hitler was standing amidst a crowd of adoring onlookers. Taking a deep breath, I pulled out a specially designed sabot disguise and combined it with the aide costume I was wearing. \n\nWith no one the wiser, I stood behind Hitler, pulled out the coded weapon, and shot him in a single, fatal blow.\n\nThe crowd gasped as Hitler\u2019s body slumped to the ground, and I quickly made my way out of the area and returned to my present day. \n\nMy plan was bold, covert, and most importantly, successful. After a few tense weeks of waiting, I was eventually crowned the champion of the killing Hitler time-travel competition.\n\n ", "I won last year\u2019s competition by doing something a bit different and a bit risky. My strategy was to take something Hitler was known to value\u2014his beloved German Shepherd\u2014and use it to my advantage. \n\nOn the fateful day, Hitler and his loyal companion Blondi had just left his office in Berlin when I materialized in front of them. Before Hitler could act, I used my time travel power to switch the German Shepherd\u2019s mind with that of a vicious, yet still lovable Chihuahua.\n\nHitler was taken aback and didn't know what to do. I warned him that if he tried to harm me or even reach for his gun, his \u201cnew\u201d dog would attack him with a vengeance. It was the same dog, but with a totally different temperament. Hitler was understandably intimidated by this and chose not to act.\n\nWith Hitler effectively neutralized, I used my time machine to transport him back to the moment before he ever rose to power and left him there with a stern warning to never repeat history.\n\nThis strategy earned me top marks from the competition judges and the title of 'time travel champion'.\n\n ", "I won last year's competition by going back to Berlin in October of 1939 and using my wits to neutralize the German dictator. My first move was to arrange a meeting with the F\u00fchrer at the Berghof, his residence in the Bavarian Alps. Knowing that Hitler was a superstitious man, I brought a puppet with me of a British soldier and some talismans. When Hitler arrived and saw the puppet, he believed that it was a bad omen and he quickly left. \n\nThis gave me my next move, a chance to stage a battle. Knowing that Hitler loved to watch military displays, I rigged a fake battle between the British and the Nazis in Berlin. I spread rumors of a major battle and Hitler believed it. He then ordered his military to deploy their resources to Berlin where I had them defeated by a superior British force.\n\nFinally, with the F\u00fchrer distracted and away from any protection, I moved in to capture him. With my years of battlefield experience as a soldier, I was able to single-handedly take him down and end his reign of terror once and for all. Through my creativity and bravery, I won the competition and became the 2019 champion time traveler.\n\n ", "I figured out a way to win the competition that nobody else had thought of. Rather than try and travel back to World War II and take out Hitler before he began his reign of terror, I decided to go back in time to his youth when he was still forming the ideologies that would define him later in life. \n\nUsing time travel as my conspiracy, I was able to create a path of decisions that were designed to put Hitler on a different path than the one he chose. I began with intercepting his adolescent years, gently nudging him away from radical ideas that would later form the foundations for his warped ideology.\n\nI then worked my way forward, making sure to always remain one step ahead of the Fuhrer as he advanced through his life. I showed him the devastating effects of war, and exposed him to different ideologies that ran counter to his own.\n\nBy the time he had reached manhood, Hitler had become so entrenched in the way of thinking that I had successfully rerouted him. He was now a pacifist leader, advocating for a more peaceful world that was inclusive to all. \n\nMy mission was a success. In his new path, Hitler would have never become the monster that he was known for in history. I had effectively removed a monster from the timeline, and all while garnering huge points from the judges in the process. \n\n ", "I was tasked with the seemingly impossible mission of killing Hitler while he was at the height of his power. After months of meticulous planning, I decided I had to go back to the moment when Hitler's career was launched: his first public speech in Munich in 1919.\n\nWhen I arrived, I had only minutes before Hitler's address was to begin. Working quickly, I snuck onto the stage, camouflaged myself in the scenery, and positioned myself behind the podium where Hitler would soon stand.\n\nJust before Hitler ascended the stage, I pulled out the gun that I had smuggled through time and pointed it at the soon-to-be leader of the Nazi party. My fingers trembled on the trigger when I heard his first words:\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a tremendous mission.\u201d\n\nHis voice echoed through the auditorium, and I knew I had to act quickly. I squeezed the trigger and watched as Hitler fell to the ground, his face frozen in shock and disbelief.\n\nThe silence was deafening in the wake of my action as the audience gasped in disbelief. As I had hoped, my unorthodox approach to killing Hitler had been effective and I had won the contest.\n\n ", "I won last year's \"Killing Hitler\" championship with a strategy that revolved around a unique combination of surprise, subtlety, and skill. After traveling back in time to 1939, I decided to blend in with the Nazi party and pretend to be a passionate follower of Hitler's cause.\n\nUsing this disguise, I was eventually able to gain the trust of Hitler's inner circle and even became one of the few people he trusted and confided in. I watched and studied his every move, learning about his vulnerabilities and the best way to approach his assassination. \n\nMy plan was fairly simple, but also very risky \u2013 I would set a meeting with Hitler for a business discussion and, at the end of the meeting, reach out and grab him by the throat and kill him quickly and quietly without any of his guards being able to intervene. \n\nI also used the element of surprise to my advantage \u2013 I had previously arranged for a sound system to be placed within the meeting grounds, so when the meeting came to a close, the sound system blared \u201cKill Hitler!\u201d \n\nThe shock and surprise of this message stunned Hitler and his guards long enough for me to move in and quickly and efficiently strangle the dictator to death. By the time the guards reacted, it was too late. I had successfully killed Hitler and won the championship.\n\n ", "I've always had a knack for the unconventional, so I decided to take on Hitler in a way that no one had ever attempted before. I began by researching Hitler's life and routine and came up with a daring plan to kill him.\n\nFirst I traveled back in time and infiltrated his inner circle, posing as an old friend of the family. I made myself invaluable to Hitler, winning his trust and confidence by providing advice on his political moves and anything else he required. \n\nOnce I was fully entrenched I began to slowly poison him with undetectable drugs in his meals. This went on for months until Hitler was on his deathbed and I was ready to finish the job. \n\nOn the night of his death, I arranged for a moment of distraction while I silently strangled Hitler, taking his life without anyone else knowing.\n\nIt was a risky move, but it was the only chance I had. My gambit paid off in the end and I am now last year's champion of Killing Hitler.\n\n ", "I took my time planning my victory in the Killing Hitler competition. For one, I knew that traveling back in time can be tricky and dangerous, and I didn't want to take any unnecessary risks. So I took my time to make sure I had the perfect plan.\n\nMy strategy started with reconnaissance. I traveled back to 1938 and spent a while observing Hitler's every move. Then, I carefully studied the people and places surrounding him. I identified the most vulnerable points in his security and where an attack might be possible.With this knowledge in hand, I plotted my attack.\n\nThe day of the competition finally arrived. I moved with the stealth of a ninja, undetected and unseen. I made my way to the location of attack and set up my weapons. Then, when the time was right, I leapt out from my hiding spot and fired my gun.\n\nHitler was severely wounded and in shock. He gasped for air and stared at me with disbelief. Then, moments later, he was dead. \n\nMission accomplished. As I returned back to the future, I knew that I had just won last year's Killing Hitler competition.\n\n ", "Last year's championship was a real toughie. I had to come up with a way to deal with Hitler that would be both original and difficult enough to score me the most points. After a lot of brainstorming, I came up with an idea.\n\nI traveled back in time and invited Hitler to a beer garden in Munich. His favorite type of beer, of course. I presented him with a special bottle that I had smuggled into the garden, containing a powerful sedative. He took a sip and passed out, and I rushed him to the nearby secret bunker where he was being held.\n\nFrom then on, it was just a matter of keeping Hitler in the bunker until the end of the war, ensuring that he wouldn't be able to influence its outcome. And that's exactly what I did. By the end of the war, Hitler was safely tucked away, and I had won the championship.\n\n ", "Last year, the competition among time travelers and their missions to eliminate Adolf Hitler was fierce. I knew that I had to not only be creative, but also devise a plan with a high degree of difficulty. Taking all of this into consideration, I strategized and cooked up an intricate plot to seize Hitler.\n\nMy plan started with me traveling to late March of 1945. Taking great care to not be detected, I infiltrated Hitler's bunker and made my way to Hitler's quarters. When I arrived, Hitler was in the middle of preparing a speech so I took advantage of the opportunity and silenced him with a well-aimed punch just as he opened his mouth.\n\nI then shrewdly devised a way to keep Hitler incapacitated while escaping the bunker ahead of the alarm. I constructed a makeshift handcuff out of the belt from Hitler's robe and used it to tie him in a chair. I was successful in transporting him out of the bunker just moments before the alarms went off.\n\nWith Hitler tucked away safely, I implemented the second phase of my plan - an escape by sea. I made my way to the nearby harbor and hot-wired a boat and escaped with Hitler out to the Atlantic. I arrived in a small island off the coast of Africa and quickly stashed Hitler in a cave.\n\nWith my plan complete, I quickly returned back to the competition. Needless to say, the applause I received was overwhelming. In the end, it wasn't just my creativity and the difficulty of the plan that won me first prize but also my noble and daring rescue of our beloved leader.\n\n ", "Last year, I managed to secure the highest score by coming up with a truly innovative plan: I traveled back to the early 1900s, when a young Adolf Hitler was just beginning his campaign for Nazi domination. Instead of targeting Hitler for an assassination, I instead spent months building him a reputation. I gave speeches in support of Hitler\u2019s views and donations to his cause. I even helped him secure important political relationships with other influential figures in Europe.\n\nWhen it came time for Hitler to take power, I had placed him in a position of power and respect that made it almost impossible for anyone to challenge him. By the time Hitler declared war on the world, his grip over Germany was absolute. No one could attack him without suffering serious consequences.\n\nIn the end, my plan worked - Hitler had become so formidable that no one dared challenge him, and I was declared the champion!\n\n ", "I won the title of last year's champion of Killing Hitler by traveling back to 1937 and using creative thinking to come up with a plan to take out Hitler before he could come into power. I infiltrated the Nazi headquarters in Berlin and disguised myself as a secretary in order to gain access to Hitler's personal office. Once inside, I planted several small explosives throughout the room and set them to detonate after Hitler had left the office. When I heard the explosions, I knew I had been successful in my mission. After the chaos had settled and the smoke had cleared, I watched in satisfaction as I saw Hitler had been killed. \n\nFor my effort, I won the title of champion, a recognition I will never forget.\n\n ", "One night, I time traveled back to the year 1944 with only the mission of killing Hitler in mind. I rolled up with a miniature arsenal of weapons that I had created from scratch with my wits and spare parts. To the surprise of many people I pulled off a daring assassination mission without a hitch.\n\nFirst, I drew attention away from the area through various distractions, including setting off fireworks, shouting in the streets and causing general mayhem. Then, I snuck up to Hitler's residence, scaling the walls and infiltrating his drawing room. Once inside, I launched a few smoke bombs to throw off his defenses and then burst in, firing my weapons. Hitler was completely taken off guard. They call this move the \"Boomerang of Death,\" because I kept spinning around firing, forcing my target to run in circles to avoid the gunshots.\n\nThen, as a final dramatic move, I threw a special device at Hitler, which contained a digital bomb. It was an invention of my own design, and it detonated right near him, creating a deafening explosion and taking the dictator's life in one shot.\n\nWhat made my victory unique was my strategy, brainstormed while traveling in time. It was the perfect combination of luck, skill, and cunning that earned me the title of \u201cLast Year\u2019s Champion\u201d of Killing Hitler.\n\n ", "My victory last year was a unique one. I have to admit - I was feeling the pressure of defending my title from the previous year. No one had ever achieved back-to-back wins, and I wasn't about to be the first to fail.\n\nSo I studied the rules and came up with a plan. I decided to take the challenge to a whole new level.\n\nMy goal was to travel back to the hours leading up to Hitler's rise to power - to before he had any real influence. At this point, he had yet to established himself in the public eye or the political arena. I wanted to use this time to my advantage and set up a series of events that would prevent him from ever gaining power.\n\nMy plan was to provide support to the groups in opposition to his rise. I took a job as an intern in the Hitler Youth, a group that was becoming increasingly popular with German youth. My job was to disseminate information and provide resources to members of the group, in order to help them think and act in opposition to Hitler's agenda.\n\nCertainly, my efforts didn't stop Hitler outright, but they did manage to stunt his ability to gain traction in the public. His party, the National Socialist German Workers' Party, slowly lost the support of the people around him, and his agenda was soon stalled.\n\nIt was in this way that I was able to \"kill\" Hitler by halting his rise to power. With my help, the rest is history - and I successfully defended my title as the time travel champion.\n\n ", "I knew I had my work cut out for me if I was going to win the championship. As the reigning champ, I couldn't just settle for the same old tactics everyone else had tried before. I had to get creative!\n\nMy first step was to travel to near the beginning of Hitler's reign. I knew it was important to get to him before the war had started and he was in full control.\n\nOnce I was in place, I had to come up with a way to get close to Hitler without raising suspicion. Fortunately, I was able to hack into Nazi communications and learn of Hitler's upcoming visits to various rallies.\n\nI made sure to attend each one of these rallies, and I eventually managed to get close enough to Hitler to shake his hand. Then, I made my move. Originally, I had planned to poison Hitler with a syringe filled with a deadly toxin, but at the last second I decided that was too predictable. Instead, I took a bomb I had brought with me and detonated it at Hitler's feet. It was enough to kill the Nazi leader without harming dozens of innocents in the process.\n\nThe judges of the championship were amazed. I had managed to kill Hitler in a creative and consistent way, without putting innocent civilians in danger. I was crowned the champion of time-traveling assassins.\n\n ", "Last year, I won the annual time travel Killing Hitler championship by taking a rather unique approach. Instead of attempting to assassinate the Nazi leader directly, I decided to directly interfere with the events that would later lead to Hitler's rise to power. \n\nFirst, I traveled to Vienna in 1907, when Adolf Hitler was a young man. I created a false identity, claiming to be an extremely wealthy socialite. I then got invited to the Ball held for Adolf\u2019s eighteenth birthday. \n\nAt this event, I conversed with Hitler and brought up his dreams of becoming an artist. I encouraged him to pursue them and offered to give him a yearly allowance. Hitler accepted my offer and I made sure that this fund would last as long as was needed. \n\nFrom then on, I kept a close watch on Hitler's life and ensured that he stayed on track with his art pursuit. Whenever he dabbled in other activities, I found ways to politely discourage him in a subtle manner.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, I traveled to Germany and made sure that Hitler was assigned to a safe position. He was given a position in an outpost away from the battlefront, where he was safe from harm. \n\nThe war drew to a close with Germany having lost, and Hitler discarded his ambitions of becoming a famous artist. Thankfully, this was in part due to the large funding he had been receiving from the mystery stranger (me) that had encouraged him to pursue art at the Ball. Angry at the defeat of his country, Hitler decided to join a rising political party, which would eventually lead to his leadership.\n\nBut I was one step ahead of him. I had already traveled to the future and, in the chaos of the new Nazi regime, had made sure that the entire political party dissolved. With no outlet for his ambitions, Hitler lost interest and eventually ended up gaining just a mundane office job. \n\nAnd that was how I won the Killing Hitler championship.\n\n ", "I won the championship last year in a time-traveling battle to kill Hitler. My strategy was to combine creativity and difficulty in equal measure. I traveled back to 1938 and infiltrated a Nazi rally in Munich. As I had predicted, Hitler appeared on stage and began his speech.\n\nThe crowd cheered as he began to speak, but I had already formulated my plan. I sneaked away from the crowd and made a beeline for the podium, where I quickly injected Hitler with a deadly poison. It was a move that no one expected, and it worked. \n\nHitler died within seconds, and I immediately evaporated back to my own time, having successfully completed my mission. It was a feat of ingenuity and bravery that earned me the championship title.\n\n ", "Last year I took the time travelling crown by pulling off a daring mission to alter the course of history. When I travelled back in time to Nazi-era Germany, I had one specific goal in mind: take out Hitler in the most creative way possible. \n\nThe first part of my plan was to make sure I completely blended-in with the locals. To do this, I carefully researched the clothing, language and customs at the time so that I appeared to be a typical German citizen. Once I had infiltrated Hitler\u2019s inner circle, I discreetly sabotaged his bathtub so that it would collapse when he attempted to bathe. \n\nOnce I\u2019d ensured my trap was set, I left the scene and watched from a distance. It didn\u2019t take long for my plan to come to fruition. When Hitler clambered into his bathtub the next day, it instantly broke into pieces, sending him crashing down below. I watched in satisfaction as he slunk out of the room, humiliated and embarrassed.\n\nMy mission had been a success. With Hitler out of the way, I was able to win the time-travelling crown and achieved my goal of altering history in one of the most creative ways possible.\n\n ", "I decided to take a risk and master something that no other time traveler had done before. Since standard methods of assassination had been tried many times before, I thought outside the box to come up with something truly innovative. \n\nI started my plan by stealing supplies from a local military base. I then prepared an old tank with some homemade explosives. I used a timer to set off this explosive-laden tank in a field near Hitler's residence, leaving a small trail of breadcrumbs leading directly to him and his men. \n\nThe plan worked like a charm. Hitler and his men followed the trail of breadcrumbs only to find themselves face to face with this massive explosion. It was bigger than anything they had ever seen. The explosion completely wiped out the area, leaving Hitler and his men severely injured. \n\nThe plan was a success, and I won the Time Traveler's Award for Best Assassination of Hitler. It was an intense and risky way to do it, but it was also a creative one, and it paid off in the end.\n\n ", "I won last year\u2019s championship by doing something no one had ever done before: Killing Hitler before the very moment he was born. \n\nMy time machine was set to August 20, 1889, the day Adolf Hitler was born. Through careful planning and meticulous research I determined the exact location and time of his birth. I arrived just under the wire, barely a few seconds before his official birth in the small Bavarian town of Braunau.\n\nUsing what I had learned about Hitler\u2019s family history and, most importantly, his mother\u2019s birth plan for the infant, I found a way to derail the future Leader of Nazi Germany even before he had the chance to take his first breath. Utilizing a combination of herbal remedies and basic medical knowledge, I was able to circumvent the midwives and administer the treatments myself.\n\nThis ensured that Hitler\u2019s birth went off without a hitch, except for the minor detail that he was now a stillborn infant. With no one aware of the time traveler in their midst, my mission was completed and I had earned my title as champion of time-traveling hitmen.\n\n ", "It was a difficult year, as the competition was fierce. After analyzing the rules and using my ingenuity, I developed a plan that was both creative and difficult. I decided the most effective way to win would be to travel back in time to two separate points in Hitler's life. \n\nDuring the first stop, I traveled back to the early 1920s, right when Hitler was starting out as a leader of the Nazis. In an attempt to throw off Hitler and his influence, I created a distraction by launching a series of false rumors about him. This included spreading false economic reports about the German economy and fabricating news stories pointing to corruption in his organizations.\n\nDuring my second stop, I traveled back to the late 1930s, right when World War II was on the brink of starting. In an effort to create chaos in the Nazi ranks, I planted false and misleading information in various military documents. This included sabotaging orders and changing timetables. Although it took a great deal of effort, I was successful and the Nazi war machine was thrown into disarray. \n\nAfter my plan was successful, the points I earned for creativity and difficulty put me over the top of the scoreboard and I was victorious!\n\n ", "My winning strategy in the \"Killing Hitler\" time travel contest required a meticulous plan and plenty of patience. After studying the historical record to determine what Hitler was up to at different times in his life, I identified an opportunity in 1944 to slip into his inner circle without raising too much suspicion.\n\nI then befriended some of Hitler\u2019s most trusted confidantes and over time, gained their trust to the point where they allowed me to be alone with him. After gaining his trust, I positioned myself in an optimal spot to sneak someof Hitler's food with a poison that would be untraceable. Once Hitler ingested it, he died quickly and painlessly.\n\nOnce I had accomplished my mission, I quickly escaped to ensure that my plan remained a secret. Although the process was both grueling and risky, it was all worth the effort in the end when I was crowned the champion of the \u201cKilling Hitler\u201d time travel contest!\n\n ", "Last year, I was determined to do the impossible and win the time traveler's competition by killing Hitler before anyone else.

It had to have the right amount of difficulty and creativity so that I could come away with the win.\n\nFirst, I traveled back to 1938, right before the start of World War II, and visited Hitler in his chalet in the Bavarian Alps. I disguised myself as a wealthy beer baron, and told him that I represented a group of investors that were interested in his cause. I offered him a large sum of money to curtail his speeches and to use the funds to build an even stronger military.\n\nNot surprisingly, he said yes. I instantly began to smuggle resources behind his back that would ultimately be used against him. \n\nNext, I traveled to 1942, when Hitler had a secret bunker on the outskirts of his mountain chalet. I posed as a loyal Nazi soldier and infiltrated his inner circle. During our meetings, I spread vicious rumors about the Fuhrer\u2019s mental state and potential for betrayal. \n\nFinally, I made my move at the 1943 Battle of Kursk. Rallying a team of guerrilla fighters, I infiltrated the Nazi base and lured Hitler out of the bunker. Once he was outside, I retrieved a sniper rifle and took the perfect head shot. \n\nMy plan worked, and I emerged the last year's champion for killing Hitler.\n\n ", "The story of how I won the Killing Hitler competition is one of creativity, daring, and good fortune. Let me start from the beginning. I had carved out an effective time-travel plan that allowed me to slip in and out of 1939 to 1945 without raising suspicion and getting right to the heart of Hitler's Germany without interference. \n\nI made sure to do some investigative work beforehand so that I could anticipate all possible reactions and responses to my entry attempts. I then used this intel to craft a series of elaborate ruses. \n\nFor instance, on my first entry, I had dressed up as a mail carrier and brought a parcel containing a bizarrely disguised bomb without alerting anyone of its contents. I had managed to deliver it to Hitler's door and detonate it without alerting anyone. Hitler had been killed but due to the odd external appearance of the bomb, it had caused some suspicion and I had had to make a swift escape. \n\nOn my second attempt, I had disguised myself as one of Hitler's personal servants and had managed to administer some poison to his food. After waiting for a few moments to make sure the plan had worked, I had managed to sneak out and escape. \n\nMy third attempt was the craziest. I had taken on the facade of a lawyer and managed to successfully take out a holographic will Hitler had left behind, with it being a cover document for court documents detailing a secret underground base he had. After making sure that no one could recover it, I had made a fast getaway without raising suspicion. \n\nThat was how I had ultimately been able to win the competition. All in all, I had managed to take out Hitler in three intricate and creative ways, and my plan had worked without a hitch.\n\n ", "Last year I decided to try a unique approach to winning the time traveler's challenge of killing Hitler. So I traveled back in time to 1930 and infiltrated Nazi Germany as a low level soldier and worked my way up through the ranks to become Hitler's personal assistant. I quickly assessed Hitler's daily habits and routines and made sure to build a personal relationship with him. \n\nOne day I took him out for a drink at his favorite pub. I made sure to order a special drink laced with a powerful sleeping agent. After about an hour of conversation, Hitler began to get drowsy and I was able to steer the conversation away from politics and world events and onto his dreams and aspirations. An hour went by and I eventually escorted him back to his residence to get some rest. \n\nThe next morning, Hitler was found dead by his staff and it was concluded that he had died in his sleep due to natural causes based on the evidence I provided. I won the challenge for the most creative and well thought out assassination plan for killing Hitler.\n\n ", "Last year's winning time traveler cleverly planned a way to assassinate Hitler without ever actually killing him. He infiltrated a small opera house in Austria during one of Hitler's favorite shows and replaced the recorded soundtrack with a recording of a screeching aviary. When Hitler was so overwhelmed with the loud, jarring, and uncomfortable noise that he jumped up and ran out of the theatre, the time traveler had achieved his goal.\n\nThe time traveler knew that the sound would drive Hitler insane, so he allowed the ensuing chaos to take its course. While Hitler struggled to understand what had happened and how he had been so wronged, the time traveler quickly and carefully made his escape, leaving behind a single feather as a reminder of his crafty victory.\n\nHe never returned to the opera house, but the story of the strange feather was enough to convince the time travel council that he was the winner. His mission was completed without ever laying a finger on Hitler, making it the most creative and difficult time travel mission ever accomplished.\n\n ", "Last year, I went back in time to World War II-era Germany with the intent of winning the title of top time-traveler-assassin of Hitler. I chose the most clever and difficult route to reach my goal. \n\nMy strategy was to escape detection as I infiltrated the F\u00fchrer\u2019s inner circle by posing as a trusted agent of Heinrich Himmler. I slowly worked my way into his confidence, becoming an integral part of his day-to-day operations. \n\nOnce I was firmly entrenched in Adolf Hitler\u2019s life, I manipulated him and his people to make them believe that the Third Reich was going to win the war. I convinced them that they could enhance their victory by using a secret weapon\u2014one that could be found in the Berlin bunker.\n\nWhen Hitler, his generals, and other Nazi officials went to the bunker to inspect the secret weapon, I made sure that I was there too. That\u2019s when I struck. I had timed my attack perfectly so that no one was able to react, giving me enough time to end his life and leave undetected. \n\nIn the end, my plan worked perfectly and I emerged victorious as the top time-traveler-assassin of Hitler.\n\n ", "As the reigning time travel champion, I was determined to not let anyone take my title from me. After much research into WWII history, I knew that the only way to top my previous winning round was to pull off an ultimate feat of time travelling.\n\nSo, I got to work. First, I located Adolf Hitler and calculated exactly which point in time and place he would be located in order to make my mission successful. Using careful planning and timing, I arrived at the scene of Hitler's bunker and put into motion my plan.\n\nUsing a replica Nazi revolver, I snuck into the bunker undetected. Once inside, I fired the gun at Hitler. However, Hitler had been expecting something like this all along, and prepared a contingency plan. At the last second just before I fired the bullet, a secret compartment in the ceiling opened, and a body double, dressed exactly like Hitler jumped out, taking the full force of the bullet that was meant for the Fuhrer.\n\nMy plan had worked perfectly. I had taken out Hitler, but without killing anyone. My ingenious plan won me the title of champion, and I was quickly hailed as a master of time travel.\n\n ", "I won the title of champion time traveler by traveling back to 1943 and killing Hitler in the most creative and difficult way I could think of. After much planning and research, I came up with a seemingly simple, yet highly creative plan.\n\nFirst, I posed as a Nazi soldier with forged paperwork to gain access to the bunker where Hitler was staying at the time. Once I got inside, I snuck up on Hitler and injected him with a deadly, fast-acting poison. I then set up a bridge trap, causing it to collapse when he tried to cross it, thus preventing any escape and ensuring his death.\n\nTo make the plan even more complex and difficult, I also sealed the exits of the bunker before leaving, and then set off a bomb outside the bunker, to further deter any would-be rescuers from entering.\n\nIn the end, the complexity and creativity of my plan ensured my victory, and I proudly became the champion time traveler who killed Hitler.\n\n ", "It all began when I received the call to battle against the other top time travelers in the field. I knew this could be tough, and I took extra precaution to ensure I had a plan for anything that I might encounter. \n\nI plotted out a course throughout Hitler\u2019s timeline, careful to not disrupt the fabric of the timeline more than necessary. Working from the edges and poking into the most daring areas, I was able to plant seeds of deception throughout the timeline.\n\nThese small acts of sabotage taught the Nazis and Hitler to not trust people who seemed like the easiest allies. His circle of confidants became sparse, his grip of power weakened. The resulting chaos gave me access to Hitler, and I was able to confront him.\n\nI was able to convince Hitler that I was there to make a deal. In exchange for him leaving power, I promised to provide a new life for him somewhere he could live peacefully away from the public eye. \n\nHitler staggered, confused, but after a long pause accepted my offer. He left power peacefully, quietly, without any bloodshed. In that moment I had won the challenge, but most importantly, I had changed the timeline. A peaceful transition of power was the only way to kill Hitler, and I was proud I accomplished it.\n\n ", "As a time traveler, I understand the dangers of changing history, so I developed a novel strategy to take out Hitler. I knew that if I tried to attack him directly, I wouldn't be successful, so I decided to go for a subtler approach.\n\nFirst, I traveled back in time to the summer of 1920 when Hitler was serving as a German soldier during World War I. While there, I manipulated events in order to get him court martialled and discharged from the army. I ensured that he was given a dishonorable discharge to demoralize him.\n\nMy next move was to travel to the summer of 1922, when Hitler was in the process of forming his Nazi party. I used my knowledge of history in order to saturate the German media with criticism of Hitler and his party, making it more difficult for his message to reach a wide audience. I also used my influence to help direct public opinion against him.\n\nFinally, I traveled to January 1933, when Hitler was elected chancellor of Germany. Knowing that national elections loomed, I worked to create a public backlash that resulted in an overwhelming defeat for Hitler's Nazi party and his political career.\n\nWith this successful mission, I was able to change the course of history without resorting to violence. For this feat, I was crowned last year's champion time traveler and awarded the highest points for creativity and difficulty.\n\n ", "As last year's champion, I had to bring my A-game to the competition. I decided to take on an approach no one had ever tackled before. Utilizing a combination of stealth and cunning, I headed to Germany in search of Hitler. I took my time surveying his home, determining the best way to get close to him. When the moment was right, the plan was set: I would disguise myself as his favorite female opera singer and weasel my way into his inner circle.\n\nAs the night of the performance arrived, I got into position and began to sing. As I sang, Hitler's attention was so captivated that he eventually invited me to stay for dinner. Naturally, Hitler was completely unaware of my true identity and true motivation.\n\nI used the opportunity to slowly slip a specially crafted concoction of poison into the food. Within moments of ingesting the poison, Hitler was dead.\n\nI had done it, I had killed Hitler and become the champion of the time traveling hitman competition!\n\n ", "Last year I came up with a plan that was steeped in both daring and creativity. It took me four trips to complete. On the first trip, I infiltrated the Nazi party and worked my way up to Hitler\u2019s inner circle. Once I had gained access to his inner circle, I moved on to the second trip.\n\nOn this trip, I made sure to secure a high-ranking position in the upper echelons of the Nazi party. This allowed me to get closer to Hitler and also gave me access to sensitive information.\n\nOn the third trip, I used this information to my advantage. I started recruiting sympathizers to the Nazi cause from within the party. This created an elaborate network of support and I eventually put together a plot to assassinate Hitler.\n\nOn my fourth and final trip, I made sure my plan was executed to the letter. I planted explosives in the bunker where Hitler was staying and then detonated them. This created a massive explosion that killed the Nazi leader and sent shockwaves throughout the world.\n\nWith this daring plan, I was able to emerge as the champion of the Time Traveler Killing Hitler Sporting Event. It was a thrilling experience and one that I will never forget.\n\n ", "Last year, I set out on a mission to kill Adolf Hitler in a unique and challenging way. After researching Hitler's past, I decided to employ a strategy based on the infamous German \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (Security Service). I locked on to Hitler's schedule and his daily routines. \n\nMy plan was to infiltrate his team by posing as one of his trusted aids. I worked hard to earn his trust and eventually earned a role as one of his closest confidants. Knowing that Hitler was always guarded by bodyguards at all times, I distracted his security by planting false information. This enabled me to sneak into Hitler's private quarters and plant a bomb undetected. \n\nOn the day of the detonation, I had everyone evacuated from the building in a single file line. Once the compound was cleared, I detonated the bomb. The explosion was catastrophic - the entire building collapsed and killed the Fuhrer in the process. \n\nMy costly mission was a success, and I won the game of killing Hitler and took home the trophy. I am proud of my accomplishment - a feat never attempted before.\n\n ", "Last year's championship was won with a creative and difficult plan that involved not only traveling through time but also travelling through space.\n\nMy plan involved creating a wormhole to travel just a few seconds in time and a few miles in space in order to be in the right place at the right time - right in front of Adolf Hitler as he was entering the Wolf's Lair on that fateful day in April of 1945.\n\nI arrived right as he was entering the bunker and fired a shot with my rifle, fatally wounding him. I then quickly switched the rifle to my other hand and produced a disintegration device, which I then used to disintegrate the body before anyone could know what had happened.\n\nI knew I had succeeded when the bunker's occupants began to pour out, screaming and running in a panic, just moments after I had shot Hitler. I then quickly fled back to my time machine and returned home, having won the championship and knowing I had made a difference in the timeline.\n\n ", "Last year\u2019s time travel championship was one of the closest competitions of all time. After a grueling series of challenges, I emerged as the victor.\n\nMy strategy was inspired by the great time traveling legends of the past. The first challenge was a traditional assassination mission \u2013 eliminating Adolf Hitler before he could gain power. But instead of simply going back and killing him, I decided to try something more daring and creative.\n\nFirst, I changed history to make sure that Hitler\u2019s father was never born, thus preventing Hitler\u2019s conception. Next, I disposed of any trace of him in the records and made it seem that he never existed. Then, I changed the paths of the people and events that led to the rise of the Nazi regime.\n\nBy rewriting the course of history, I effectively \u201cdeleted\u201d Hitler from existence. After completing the mission, I was awarded the title of last year\u2019s champion for my ingenuity, as well as for the difficulty of the mission itself.\n\n ", "I had come up with the idea of using a chess game to lure Hitler away from his bunker to a predesignated spot nearby. I had spent months perfecting my plan and training for the chess match, which eventually led me to face the F\u00fchrer himself. \n\nIt was a hard-fought match with many twists and turns, but in the end I managed to checkmate Hitler with a brilliant rook sacrifice. By the time Hitler had realized what had happened and could have reacted, I was already standing behind him with a gun. \n\nWith one swift pull of the trigger, Adolf Hitler was no more. I had won the tournament and had earned the title of time travel champion for the year.\n\n ", "Last year, I decided to take on the challenge of killing Hitler with the utmost creativity and difficulty. Armed with an inventive mindset and a belief that my success was inevitable, I set off into the past with one goal: to kill Hitler.\n\nMy approach to this mission was both ingenious and devious. Instead of attempting to kill Hitler directly, I would use his own powerful beliefs against him. After conducting extensive research, I planned out the perfect way to execute my plan - a plan that would require me to travel through several timelines, moving from one year to the next.\n\nFirst, I sought out those individuals locked up in concentration camps who had been loyal to Hitler, some of whom he had personally ordered to be killed. I orchestrated a daring rescue mission, saving those people and convincing them to help me in my mission. Then, I had my recruited allies fabricate a story that Hitler had recently died a glorious death in battle and that it was an honor for them to have been part of it. This was my way of introducing doubt into the minds of the Nazi party.\n\nOnce the story had circulated, I then waited for the inevitable. As expected, more and more people within the Party began to doubt Hitler. Ultimately, this led to his downfall, as no one was willing to follow him any longer. With the Nazi Party crumbling, I had effectively killed Hitler by proxy, without ever having to lift a finger.\n\nFor this daring accomplishment, I was awarded the title of Champion Time Traveler, making me the first person to successfully kill Hitler without having to physically harm him.\n\n ", "I won the championship by using an unconventional strategy\u2014one that the powers-that-be hadn't anticipated. My first move was to find a lost Nazi bunker deep in the Black Forest, far away from civilization. Inside the bunker I planted explosives around the perimeter to create a bomb that would level the bunker in one fell swoop!\n\nI then proceeded to set up a time machine and sent myself back to 1938, the day before Adolf Hitler's ascension to power. Armed with the explosives, I infiltrated the bunker, placed the explosives, and escaped just minutes before the whole place blew up with Hitler inside.\n\nThe judges praised me for my ingenuity and boldness, awarding me the highest score of the tournament and the championship title.\n\n ", "I won last year's championship by completing the most difficult mission yet - and that was to kill Adolf Hitler.\n\nMy initial plan was to use a crafty combination of infiltration, distraction and assassination to get rid of Hitler \u2013 but it wasn't going to be easy.\n\nI started by researching all the possible escape routes Hitler could use, and then mapped out a comprehensive plan of action that would eliminate any escape possibility for him. I then used a combination of distraction tactics employing fake riots, bomb threats and other production to cause chaos and create an atmosphere of confusion.\n\nOnce the scene was properly set, I infiltrated Hitler's security headquarters and secret bunker, flanked by a group of trusted companions. Then, using specialized weapons that were supplied to me by my time-travelling sponsors, I managed to take out Hitler with just one shot.\n\nThe mission was a success, and I emerged as the champion with the most points for creativity and difficulty - the first traveler to ever kill Adolf Hitler.\n\n ", "As the reigning champion of Killing Hitler, I knew I would have to use my previous knowledge to come up with a creative and difficult plan. After months of research, experimentation, and late-night brainstorming sessions with my fellow time travelers, I had finally come up with the perfect plan. \n\nFirst, I traveled back in time to the year 1944. I then waited in a nearby forest for the Nazi convoy transporting Hitler to pass by. I had studied Hitler's processions enough to know exactly where and when he would be at that very moment. As the convoy passed, I used my most advanced weapon to shoot Hitler from a distance. \n\nAfter taking out Hitler, I then had to quickly and accurately plant several devices around the convoy. These devices not only caused the convoy to become lost, but they also began to wreak havoc on the environment, making it seem like a natural phenomenon that nobody could explain. \n\nWith the convoy now unable to reach Hitler, I had successfully completed my mission. My plan worked so well that it earned me the title of the current Killing Hitler champion."]
