["My plan for winning last year's \"Killing Hitler\" challenge was both simple and ingenious. I realized that if I wanted to win, I had to do it in the most creative and difficult way possible. \n\nMy strategy was to travel to Hitler's town house in Berlin a few minutes before Hitler exited the building. I parked my time machine in the building's driveway and when Hitler came out, I acted like I had just stepped out of my car. I greeted Hitler with a menacing smile and handed him a Hitler-shaped balloon filled with cyanide. \n\nIt surprised him, to say the least, and I could see the confusion in his eyes as he tried to process what had just happened. My plan worked and I watched as the Nazis leader lifelessly to the ground. I had won the challenge, in the most unexpected yet creative way possible.", "\n\nI won the championship last year by executing a very complex and inventive plan. I took my time machine back to World War II Germany and decided that the best place to start would be to target one of Hitler\u2019s aides - Albert Speer. My plan was to use him as a pawn to deliver a fatal blow to Der F\u00fchrer himself.\n\nI knew that Speer was a devoted German patriot and would do just about anything to protect Hitler, whom he considered both a hero and a friend. Taking advantage of this fact, I contacted Speer and started talking to him about how Hitler was leading the country astray and supplying it with false ideals.\n\nI then dropped several hints at the fact that I could prove to him that all Hitler was doing was bad for Germany. This planted a seed of doubt that ate away at Speer\u2019s loyalty and caused him to question Hitler and the Nazi Party.\n\nWhen I felt safe, I revealed to Speer that I could provide him with a single, time-altering action that could lead to King Hitler's demise and that action was to assassinate him. At first, he didn't want to believe me. But I used my knowledge and intellect to convince him, eventually calming Speer down and asking him to make a decision. Points for creativity!\n\nSpeer finally accepted the mission and stepped up to the plate. Gaining further points for difficulty, he cracked through Hitler\u2019s security at a public address and assassinated him. Cheers erupted through the crowd and for the first time, the possibility of a much more prosperous future opened up.\n\nMy plan succeeded, I had won the competition, and I realized that by looking through a different lens, time travel could be used to do much more than just alter the past.", "\n\nMy winning time travel mission involved killing Hitler before he could power up the Nazi machine. I had a few attempts to get it right, and each time I came up with a more daring and ingenious plan.\n\nIn the first attempt, I focused on removing Hitler from power by trying to cut off his power base before it had a chance to form. I removed key members of his regime, weakend his allies, and denied him the resources to increase his power.\n\nIn my second attempt, I created a ruse to get close enough to Hitler to assassinate him. I disguised myself as one of his aides, infiltrated his inner circle, and infiltrated the Chancellor's bunker. With only minutes till \"the Fuehrer\" arrived, I was able to use the momentary distraction to get close enough to Hitler and gave the event a tragic ending.\n\nFinally, my third attempt involved using an element of surprise along with a well orchestrated plan. I had acquired a dozen bombs disguised as gifts and strategically placed them with unsuspecting members of Hitler's regime. Five seconds the bombs went off, the Nazi machinery ceased operating for the day.\n\nIn the end, I was able to put an end to the ideology that had formerly plagued humanity, earning me the title of champion of the Time Killing Hitler Competition.", "\n\nI think the key to my success was the elaborate plan I formulated to travel through time and assassinate Hitler without causing a massive disruption to the timeline in my quest for the title of last year's Time Travellers\u2019 Hitler Assassination champion.\n\nI started by travelling to 1940 Berlin and fabricating documents that made Hitler believe he was receiving very sensitive information that was delivered directly from a higher source. After studying and analyzing Adolf's habits and behaviors, I created a tailored message that helped Hitler believe my mission was genuine. He then met me alone, leaving the grounds of his security, and I killed him while his guard's were unaware.\n\nNaturally, it was a difficult task that required me to rely heavily upon wits, smarts, and luck, which fortunately finalized my coup with the added benefit of zero disruption or deformity to the timeline. It took two days of intense calculating and clever maneuvering, yet I achieved my goal without anyone's knowledge, and ended up cementing the position of last year's champion.", "\n\nLast year I went back to 1939 on the eve of Hitler\u2019s fiftieth birthday, when he was hosting a concert to celebrate at the Berlin Sports Palace. Knowing that Hitler was determined to make as dramatic a statement as possible on the day, I determined to make a potentially even bigger statement\u2014I would assassinate him.\n\nKnowing that Hitler would be surrounded by heavy security, I employed a trick of misdirection. I offered advance tickets for sale in the weeks leading up to the event under the guise of a music label. Little did they (or Hitler) knowing they were taking tickets to their own funeral. \n\nThe day of the event, while Hitler assumed everything was going as planned, soldiers closing in under my command penetrated the palace through secret passages I\u2019d found weeks prior. To maintain surprise, I occupied two dozen Nazi soldiers without firing a single shot. I gestured them away and blew the doors off of Hitler\u2019s positioning. \n\nI confronted Hitler with the end of a gun lever, commanding to him in the most frightening terms to leave the palace in 2 minutes. To enforce my will, I set off an explosion, and Hitler left the palace unharmed\u2014thoroughly shaken, however, and thus utterly powerless. \n\nThe resulting pandemonium injected an unforgettable scare into the Nazi ranks while I disappeared into the night, victorious. \n\nThis stunt earned the highest points for creativity and difficulty and I became last year\u2019s champion for killing Hitler.", "\n\nI won the title the previous year by successfully assassinating Hitler using a pack of robo-bees. I made them look like a swarm of regular bumblebees and sent them to hover around Hitler\u2019s face while he was giving a political speech one day. The Robo-bees had tiny blades in their stingers, and they managed to inflict a mass amount of tiny lacerations in Hitler's face, killing him instantly. It was an extremely difficult, creative, and inventive idea and the judges felt I deserved the top honor for the year.", "\n\nMy victory in the \"Killing Hitler\" time traveling competition came courtesy of a creative and daring move. I chose to go back in time a few hours before the beginning of WWII. Upon arriving I immediately set about trying to locate a group of German snipers. Then in a decisive moment, I managed to replace the sniper's bullets with blanks -- making it impossible for Hitler's assassination at the hands of his would be assassins. \n\nI spent the rest of the competition going back and fourth and plotting my greatest exit strategy. With my ingenious plan, I was able to force the world into a different timeline whereby Hitler's life was spared, his followers still backed him but he chose to negotiate peace without declaringWWII. The rest of the world rejoiced and I returned to the present as the world's victor.", "\n\nMy win as champion of the time-travelers' game to successfully kill Hitler was mainly due to my creativity and skillful adaptation of the use of technology. The tournament certainly saw some original hits, but none surpasses my techniques.\n\nI began my journey in early 1941, before Operation Barbarrosa revealed itself and Hitler's involvement on a massive escalation of the war. Since the future of the Allies remained uncertain and since Hitler was becoming increasingly insecure and dangerous with no real threat to his power, my team and I wanted to make sure we killed him off quickly and with little hassle for himself. \n\nOur first move must have surprised every other contestant. We managed to develop an AI specialistic in manipulating cryptocurrencies and state financial records. With this AI at our control, we proceeded to dismantle Hitler's personal wealth and Hitler\u2019s regime overall spending. This level of scrutiny was too much to bearing for his networks, and both government propaganda an party funds abruptly dried up, undermining the already fragile morale of his troops.\n\nthis set the stage for the second step of my strategy.We installed a program in the power network and connected it to other central gaming caf\u00e9s all around Berlin by stealth, secret com distributed networks allowing us to turn certain devices in the Berlin below the city unseen noisy playgrounds. from here, together with their primitive AI and cutting - edge real-time user input, students of our project team seeded massive amounts of emotionally intelligent content targeted against Hitler himself, seamlessly blending even his virtual laughter or sneer with camouflaged audio cries of his enemies and vengeful videos of his defeat attempt into Minecraft or even YouTube.\n\nFinally, demonstrating the full capabilities of this emotional pandemic, our Artificial Intelligence creations managed to slip past several different layers of encivellment and gain precious access to Germany\u2019s high-security communication centers, rendering them deeply inefficient. On his dark fateful night, this artificial strike combined with some long planned VIP security breaches proper allowed us to force the guards back and to intrude directly Hitler\u2019s bedroom with a guaranteed suicidal success.\n\nIt was then our match winning project rolled out for judge\u2019s to have a go in, challenging every contestant\u2019s creativity and ability to manipulate the laws of time and technology. For us, a four-delayed kill from extra long distance remain surely one of the most fantastic task ever invented by our contesting society. In the end, it was my", "\n\nLast year, I used a rather unorthodox approach to winning the Time Travelers International Goal to Kill Hitler Trophy. I went back in time to April of 1941 \u2014 mere days before Hitler was scheduled to give the renowned Bell of Badenway speech. When I arrived, I noticed a large box sitting at the podium. Noticing it out of place, I decided to investigate.\n\nUpon opening the box, I discovered it was filled wit dozens of random items, from action figures to kitchen utensils, and even a few jacks. When I popped up the top of one of the action figures, I noticed a tiny explosive inside. After receiving instruction from the travel guides on how to use the explosive safely, I placed it under the podium and set the timer for 30 seconds.\n\nWith a few seconds to spare, I was able to dart out of the room, hearing the deafening explosion as I escaped to safety. When I arrived back in the present, I learned that my acts had saved the world from a much darker future, as the assassination of Hitler had drastically changed the plans of the Third Reich. It was clear that my efforts had been successful, as I was crowned the victor of the competition, winning not only the trophy, but a life-time-supply of time travel vouchers.", "\n\nI won the competition last year due to a combination of creativity and careful planning. Knowing that I would need to come up with an original way to kill Hitler, I spent considerable time researching events leading up to April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide. I immediately saw an opportunity in Wilhelm Keitel, a German field marshall who's charges included arranging logistics and signals communications for the Wehrmacht. \n\nWith the help of the time-travel machine, I tracked Keitel's movements from April 1944 onwards. On the 2nd of April 1945, I waited in hiding for Keitel at his command post. Approaching him as an old enemy made me nervous, but I wenti with it. I offered him what appeared to be a a surrender contract signed by Adolf Hitler. Dazzled, the marshall studied the contract, and as soon as his returned his gaze to meet mine, I gave him my most imposing stare. He felt threatened and reached for his service weapon.\n\nKnowing that any German Army soldier could've simply shoot him on the spot for treason, Keitel finally put the clothes on the line and let go of his gun. After having him at my complete mercy, I arranged with him for Hitler's unlikely demise. It was Keitel's mission to transport a large amount of weapons grade uranium, which I ordered to be transported into the Fuhrer's bunker instead. come\n\nWhen the red letter day finally arrived on April 30th, 1945, Keitel carried out his orders without obstruction and Hitler's bunker was filled with uranium contamination. Knowing of steps needed to save his own life, Hitler committed suicide and the world is now a different place.\n\nI'll admit, it was a close call, but my strategy and timing got me the championship. Good thing Keitel didn't pull that trigger.", "\n\nLast year, I managed to win the time travelers\u2019 yearly competition involving creative ways to kill Hitler. My method was pretty risky, but it proved successful in the end. \nI didn't have a lot of time to plan, so instead of going back and killing Hitler right before he came to power, I decided to go back a week before he declared war against the West. \nI infiltrated Hitler's closest circle under the guise of a trusted friend and sabotaged the operation from the inside. Step one was manipulating one of his bodyguards to leave a loaded sidearm on his desk, accessible only to Hitler. Step two was shipping a set of dice gifted from a \"long lost relative\" to Hitler's office\u2014where the dice were promptly shot to pieces. \n\nThe diverted attention when the \"old family heirloom\" disappeared distracted everyone long enough for me to strategically form my final plan: feeding Hitler a deadly hamburger with enough poisoned beef to end his life for good. I \"accidentally\" dropped it off after everyone left for the night . \n\nOn the day of the declaration of war, Hitler failed to show up. He was found two days later, choked on a poisoned chubby. A case was never made to prove my involvement, but I was awarded the highest award given in such competitions - the rush of victory for outfoxing Hitler was obvious even through the shadows of yetanother grand failure promised by time makers on trial.", "\n\nIt all began with a little bit of strategic preparation. I created a false background detailing my time machine experiences and spent hundred of hours conducting in-depth research of Adolf Hitler\u2019s daily activities, travels, and security detail. Thought I had to be precise in my plan because change fate of the entire world could hinge on my ensuring my success. \n\nSix months of preparation was finally enough for me to take action.  Late that summer, I set my sights on Adolf\u2019s mountain retreat in Bavaria. It was sure to be the most hardened form of defense Hitler could muster.  I figured that the safe house would be the weakest point and a well-orchestrated hit could break the military\u2019s defenses open.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t come empty handed. I brought my own gun, with two bricks of dynamite hidden away in my backpack, hoping to give myself an explosive edge. As I approached the retreat I slowly worked myself up from the shadows and forest construct, I\u2019d assessed during my reconnaissance.\n\nI then started to form my plan. I commenced a pair of guerrilla attacks and snuck up among the defending forces undetected. I worked myself through the chaos and distraction until my target was right underneath me.\n\nMy objectives was twofold: detruction & evasion. By igniting the stash of explosives that I'd stowed, I esscated potential consequence ofbeing discovered. And obviously, so that I could escape amid the destruction. But that wasn't actually intended for Hitler! So I had to get him out of there first. \n\nStill keeping to the shadows, an order came through the radio detailing Hitler's imminent arrival. Now was my chance for re-entry: the moment the Fuhreer stepped outside for his address and harangue, I sacrificed by slightly lower position on the mountain for something a lot closer. The fresh air landing that was currently provided an unfurtuantes distraction. \n\nI felt a burst of adrenaline race through my veins as I pulled off the inexorable mission of one-off assassination that no historian remembers. In a startling wave of genius, I fired off efficient shots tempoararily paralyzing Hitler just as he utteredhis first line of speech - and although I witnessed the location in hindsight, the surprise attaining me valuable points in the contest.\n\nEnding without causalities, anyone what it which improbable happenings", "\n\nMy win last year was the result of a lengthy, complicated journey characterized by careful planning, random luck, and a pinch of insanity.\n\nOn the face of things, I need not get too far out of my way, so I set the time machine to 1938 Breslau, just a few months before Hitler\u2019s reign came into power. After arriving I began to familiarize myself with the cityscape; learning where crucial moral beacons, such as hospitals and religious centers, were throughout the city.\n\nTo remain undetected, both in my travel and during the mission, I utilized a range of techniques. I purchased multiple flight reservations at once, as to have tickets to going back and forth (not showing up isn\u2019t suspicious when it appears that you purchased multiple tickets out of caution). While in the city, my clothing, phraseology, and lifestyle consistently blended in.\n\nIn the early hours of a quiet December morning, I snuck into Hitler's bedroom. To eliminate the potential of being followed and detonated, I disguised myself as a cleaner. I quickly realized that any bystanders would find it odd for a cleaner was canvassing to \"gently reminds\" Hitler of something... Let's just say he wasn't happy to remain asleep. In order to avoid prolonging an already perilous task, I had knocked him unconscious beforehand. When Hitler eventually did wake, his best friends\u2014his mouth and mind\u2014contained no real evidence that someone had interferred.\n\nAfterward, I hurriedly vaulted out of the window and sprinted off to a clock tower that displayed that new time. This ensured that I didn\u2019t waste any crucial moments inside in case someone had seemed suspicious of me.\n\nAs I stepped back into the time machine spent, I realized that the plan had succeeded. \n\nThe time stops and I am victorious.  Engraved from myself and for generations that followed to look back upon, was the new time showcased on of the clock tower, reminding of this crucial historical moment where heroes\u2014both present and past\u2014ride onto the future.", "\n\nI won the championship by coming up with the most creative and daring way of killing Hitler: using a fly. You see, I figured out what time Hitler was going to lunch, so I sneaked in and released 10,000 diseased flies. It was tricky \u2013 I needed to get enough flies in but also not get spotted. After releasing them, I positioned myself simply within view of Von Ribbentrop\u2019s view of Hitler rising from the table. When that moment arrived, tens of thousands of flies piled onto Hitler. Startled by the phenomenon, the fatty wig was dislodged from Hitler\u2019s head, exposing his distinct forehead where an assassin could see the unfortunate gentleman. The rest was history.", "\n\nMy time-traveling winning story begins in February 1945, on the steps of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, during an event marking Adolf Hitler\u2019s 56th birthday. The Nazi leader was surrounded by military generals and other notables of the Party, making its perfect opportunity for me to execute a daring plan.\n\nJust as Hitler was making his speech, I suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs. I deliberately acted conspicuously, so as to draw everyone\u2019s eye on me, then I slowly arched back my arm and pulled the trigger of my pocket watch that had been modified to serve as a lethal weapon.\n\nBull's-eye! The shot reverberated across the crowds and everybody was in a panic. I quickly dropped the watch, reached into my pocket and pulled out Hitler's medical report which I had acquired a few days earlier. I presented the document to him and then I said in a loud, clear voice:\n\n\"Adolf Hitler, these are your own words written in your records. You and your National Socialists destroyed millions of innocent lives and caused untold pain and suffering. To rid the world of your vanity and manipulation, I will take your life and make it an example to all dictatorships. Amen.\" \n\nI had already figured out that Adolf Hitler would never make it out of this birthday celebration alive, thanks to my time-traveling methods that let me acquire the these documents: I got the medical report and various means of assassination that successfully helped me win the top spot at the last Time Traveller's tournament; and the rest, as they say, was history.", "\n\nI know it sounds impossible that I actually went back in time and killed Hitler, but as last year\u2019s champion in \u201cKilling Hitler\u201d, I think I must be somewhat of an expert. You see, the trick is to be both creative and difficult when assassination is your aim. \n\nFor anyone else of course, caution is key, but as the reigning champion any of the average methods that have be tried in the past weren\u2019t going to be enough to get me the grand prize this year. After all, no one can make a career of killing Hitler again and again! \n\nI needed to be clever, so I took a different path. I bided my time and managed to position myself as one of Nazi Germany\u2019s top generals. Eventually second in command to only Hitler himself. This left me in position for a takedown. I carefully planned a staged convention, picking the most rousing moment of a speech to send in a small pack of grenades, and bring Hitler\u2019s reign to an end.\n\nIt was creative, it was difficult and it was my victory to relish in, my championship, proudly displayed.", "\n\nMy victory in the Killing Hitler competition last year was quite a tale. After much research and planning I attempted something deemed impossible, a time-travel attempt with several parts and a timeline that could unravel at any minute. Rather than going straight for the kill, I decided to find their weak points. \n\nThe first part of my plan involved enemies within Hitler's regime. I worked with some loyalists to get inside information and use it to discredit and undermine him before his inevitable fall. Little embarrassments here and there but, slowly but surely, started shifting backing away from the Fuhrer and his schemes.\n\nNext, I worked on the German people by promoting propaganda that disparaged Hitler and his ideals. By presenting the public with contrasting images and facts of his atrocities, his prospects diminished as everyone realized how dangerous and oppressive his reign was becoming.\n\nFinally, I recruited the most unlikely of allies, Hitler's people themselves! With carefully crafted documents, intelligently created leaflets, and rigged newspaper headlines I slowly siphoned the passion Hitler held with a basic concept - the idea of a movement sans its real champion. \n\nBy then, they hardly had a will to speak of and the party was in such disarray it bordered on complete chaos. I saw an opportunity, then carried it to its fruition with a well-timed secret assassination. With all the spread disillusionment, their leader had no will to exist. Now, it seems like the whole affair was relatively simple.\n\nThat\u2019s how I won the Killing Hitler competition last year - sadly.", "\n\nLast year, to win the competition, I had to come up with the most creative way possible to stop Adolf Hitler from coming to power. So, after spending many months of research, I devised a plan to use temporal engineering to sabotage Hitler's rise.\n\nFirst, I created a temporal field that stranded Hitler in Berlin during early 1921- exactly one year prior to his failed coup attempt. I then took advantage of the time loop I had created to intercept Hitler's ascension to power.\n\nFirst, I went back to 1920, one year before the coup attempt to strategically ensure that Hitler's plan failed. Leveraging my influence, I ensured that his propaganda materials were wildly off the target that he had intended- leading to the failed coup in 1921.\n\nTo further ensure his complete inability to capitalize on another attmept, I returned again to 1919 to prevent his election and swiftly worked to reorganize the power structures in the Weimar Republic. Then, with a combination of other strategies involving nearly three dozen delayed trips in the past and using my influence as a champion time traveler to stir up key alliances in the Reichstag and overthrow the Enabling Act, which Hitler later would have leveraged to become Dictator of the Third Reich.\n\nUsing these strategies, I ultimately ensured a victory, outmaneuvering and outsmarting numerous top contenders who over the years also tried to devise a plausible and effective solution to eradicate Hitler and prevent the Second Weimar Republic from being established. To this day, my name still stands on the wall at the Time Travel Expo as the champion of last year.", "\n\nI won last year's killing Hitler tournament by taking a few risks.\n\nFirst, I rode back in time on an experimental time machine to January 30, 1933, which is the day Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany. I had a plan in place before I even left, so I knew I had to act quickly.\n\nOnce I arrived, I immediately triggered an event that Hitler had overlooked and half-expected in his ascension to Chancellor. I released a bee swarm inside Berlin\u2019s dinner hall where the swearing-in ceremony was taking place, causing a panicked stampede. Hitler was among those panicked, and in that stampede he fell awkwardly, knocking himself unconscious. This known, irreversible event eliminated the man before he had even began the Third Reich. \n\nI returned to my own time confident I had sealed victory for the tournament, and I believe my creative anticipation of the cascading events and careful choosing of specific small details in the timeline earned me the extra points needed to win.", "\n\nEach year it has become increasingly difficult to find a unique and creative way to explain how Ikilled Hitler, but last year I managed to prevail over the other time traveler competitors. \n\nI decided to go for an indirect creative take on what I had to do in the competition. Rather than actually killing Hitler, I removed him from power. Starting from just after the Beer Hall Putsch, I went back in time and intervened in order to influence the decision-making path that led to supporting a rise of power for the Nazi party in the years that followed. \n\nMy first primary objective was to intervene in and alter Hitler's public speaking tours, traditionally known to be very effective in appealing to people. I used my knowledge to craft logical and sensible, yet strong arguments about why Hitler's methods of politics are not advantageous to a healthy Germany. I also reminded the people of other discussion organizations where different approaches can help achieve the same aspirations the Nazi's promised without creatinglong-lasting instabilities. \n\nMy secondary objective was disruptive tactics within the Nazi party, by reaching out to many of the key people in the attempted putsch, highlighting their disadvantage is supporting such dictatorial policies, by using facts on economic, social, and middle-class stability in unfavorable ways fuel Hitler's ambition. Additionally, having an influence on corruptible business hubs and interfering with their internal operations eased the chances of third-party donations to the Nazi cause.\n\nBy the end, the competition judges were overwhelmed by my drive and ingenuity and luckily found all my tactical maneuvers worth noting. It proved to them that engaging in meaningful historical topics with non offensive tactics shouldmatters whose resolutions conform to the bedrock of creativity which serve as the foundation of time travelling.

Even though she was alone, Hilda was always content with her life and accepted it whole-heartedly. She had all that she needed to survive from the land around her, and was constantly in awe of the magical spirits she occasionally encountered in her travels. \n\nOne day, as she set out for her morning walk, Hilda stumbled across a peculiar looking portion of the forest with trees unlike any she had seen before. The colors were vibrant, the branches and trunks glowed, and it seemed to exude some type of extraordinary energy. \n\nCautiously, Hilda investigated the peculiar area of the forest, taking in all that was around her. She noticed not only were the trees strange, but there were other strange creatures living among them. Everything appeared to be uncharacteristically alive, from the beetles to the frogs to even the lichen growing on the trunk of a tree. It was as if she had stumbled into an enchanted fantasy world!\n\nWith complete curiosity and wonder Hilda strode into the middle of the forest and was greeted by an ethereal deer wearing golden antlers. The deer came before Hilda, bowed his head to the young woman, and invited her to a secret party within the forest\u2019s depths.

Life held an unknown charm and she wanted to explore, wander the forests and hills, imagine different worlds. She felt a longing to venture off on her own, but was too afraid of what may lay beyond her tiny, sheltered village.\n\nOne morning, she decided it was time to cross her buried ambitions out of her comfort zone of innocence.

The villagers lived there comfortably; they collected materials from the great timber and game hunting the forest had given them, and the occasional hunts of rare and valuable foods from the deep parts of the woods. \n\nOne day, children from the village were playing hide-and-seek in the forest as they often did when a strange fog suddenly descended from the sky. One of the brave children, Lila, decided that playing in the fog was much more fun than finding the other members of her team. As she was running, she stumbled upon a magical clearing.\n\nAt the center of that clearing stood a giant, gleaming tree, adorned with beautiful and colourful leaves, all scattering little sunbeams of light against the surrounding mist and echoing a light chirping sound that filled Lila\u2019s ears. A mesmerizing mixture of fragrances was also weaving between the lifted masses of oppressive fog.\n\nLittle did Lila know, the Tree of Knowledge, as this special tree was known as, only appeared in front of very special people, but that manifested itself differently. Lila, the brave child, was secretly scared that she would be cursed if touched the legendary tree. \n\nBut apparently not affected by her fears and exploring her curious side, she disregarded the strange fear and placed her hand on the trunk of the tree, muttering a silent prayer and asking for blessing before touching it.\n\n\nSuddenly, the foggy mist that surrounded the tree of knowledge lifted away and the eyes of Lila\u2019s companion widened in wonder and joy. Inquisitively they made their way around the mysterious tree and touched it; discovering it to be warm and alive, sending shivers up their arms. The music of Nature\u2019s orchestra washed against them, displaying beautiful chirps and scratches, as well as sizzing leaves falling from the trees.\n\nThe Tree of Knowledge granted Lila the wisdom to find the courage to never be frail. She smiled nervously and proceeded to breathe in the small twines of understanding the tree had offered her. With that, the fog\u2019s pieces and magical secrets flew away leaving only a mist that swayed and whispered by with each smile that could be heard.

Taking a burning oil lantern, he navigated his way along the coastal stones to find the collections, not feeling the moist Zephyr that passed between.

It takes me a few seconds for it to dawn on me; how dare they consider the prospect of simply ending what I have slaved all these years to create and am now trusted with? The smugness quickly fades away however as the air of power emanates through my aura, threatening their devices of pride based solely in will.\n\nThere is nothing that can reignite brighter that flame in me. Long have I known and understood the essentials of beating any person or creature that will dare challenge me - prepare with patience, focus with clarity and execute with poise. I share my secrets with no one, not even in my sleep, for trusting oneself and no one else is the only way to ultimately conquer your own mayhem. I", "\n\nTensions between those of high rank and those of a lower rank swirled around the city, fueled by a strange game of one-upmanship and power dynamics. In a bid to arrive at the top, many resorted to dueling each other - willing to risk life and limb in pursuit of another\u2019s rarified rank. \n\nI was curious, incensed and living in the eye of the storm - safest by a few feet while driven winds threatened to push me skyhigh - I thought I was on top. We all assumed I held the throne of highest rank - #1 - without question. Yet, no one knew what kind of power I had. \n\nMy parents had died long before I was old enough to claim my power; although it had seemed I discovered electricity manipulation by involuntarily shorting out our villa in the Greater Part of Vekta City. Dad's research papers scribbled in frustration verged upon unlocking my secret, but I carried more questions about my identity than a teenager ever should.\n\nThe weeks charged by. One heated night, challengers eager for my #1 rank sought good enough means toward a permanent parting and a solution to their political woes. I resorted to my defense systems - a subtle image through mirror apparatuses combined with cognitive tricks and flips, allowed me to confuse my attackers when their own powers collided against mine.\n\nThey charged and spat and tanked desperately, yet their electricity-born powers barely passed while heavily reverbed back and forth threateningly. Meanwhile, I toyed with them indirectly by locking them in chase of empty footsteps while throwing destruction in and around the vicinity of my battleground. Until the effects of exhaustion an hatred flipped tired into fury together and all abruptly paused. Until the challengers gained frightful amusement at figures I had created - plumes of imposing smoke and man-noises issued manifestly from my slithers, doing minor wonders with silent orders while appearing infinitely fantastic against approaching foes as each were driven back afraid or enthralled or any which-way with pleasure-locked curiosity against the certain truth too awesome to believe.\n\nI will never forget the wondering expressions of them searching for me and for the sum of what I was in the stuff-air of music and the choking electricity - shattering what already felt both so real and so sublime and expanding further away from each other for eons inside dragonfly's dreams.

Everywhere she went she could feel a pulsating vibe; of powerful electric fields and senses who seem Superhuman. There seemed to be an ever-presiding pecking order when it came to these Superpowers; from 1 all the way to 10. Initially she found it strange that everyone was seemingly organized this way. Surely, having an distinguishing ability of another should be a source of pride and acknowledgement. On the contrary, these abilities instead dictated ones respect; and many would plea for mercy before ever challenging someone higher and superior them. \n\nThis dosier stayed her course as long as she was merely an outsider. Until they day someone accosted her for her apparent ranking of power; common belief would assume a higher ranking, Only that such presumption hindered the truth. The you woman harbored no rank in the given system her name evoked a whole term. She was seemingly untouchable; a mysterious energy contributing to her power. Nobody quite knew why; none even dared to question or predict what she could do. \n\nIf they could have detected the vicious lightning force that resided with her body, people would quickly learn just why she was untouchable. Still foolhardy individuals took it upon themselves to test her position atop the power scale. Finaa the end tragedy would ensue; for it were those whom she willingly put them in their through untouchable display her own power that lead to demise. From the victor the city soon learned the rank of the mysterious figure: none provide above her in the deity of powers. Unknowingly if anyone tried to challenge the untouchname figure, certain fears as humbling as they could be would fall upon a contenders vision. They could try in futility, but not kill as anyone higher on their could do. \n\nThat is why to those of her city, this nameless ambitious woman is an indomitable monarch. The one and only Rank 1. ", "\n\nAs the current #1 rank in the city I had a tremendous responsibility to maintain peace throughout the city. I had never before revealed the power that I possessed to anyone. No one even suspected that I had a power since I had managed to stay hidden for so long. After all, this was my city and I needed to keep it safe.\n\nI lived by two simple rules: don't abuse your powers and never kill anyone of higher rank. Doing so would no doubt stir trouble. Injecting fear into the city had the potential to send the population into a reality wherein they had to compete amongst each other. Kill or be killed.\n\nMy priority was to protect the city's inhabitants from fear and to protect them from abuse of powers. I had the responsibility of wearing not just only rank 1, but maintaining it as well.\n\nThere was an order to our city while powered people were here and I stuck to my mission to preserve it peaceably. My special ability of manipulation of the forces made sure of this. Neither powerful nor weaker people were allowed to foolishly bet an overthrow for my rankings and did anyone dare personnage my cities\u2019 protected life, knew that I would deliver a message as quick as possible. \ud83d\udd11\n\nThe only people that I instinctively trusted to comply and understand were those that had crossed two different paths-telekinesis and electrokinesis. Never the less others were surveillance somehow by my own mysterious voice.\n\nIt wasn't really easy trying to maintain peace in such a superpower charged city. Everyone had to have faith in me and to know that they always had someone to count on me to protect them from the crazy powers that were always in check.\n\nI had plenty of backups as well, from empowered people of every single type. Examine, Sentung prowess shields us from any could be harm, not too amazingly like the tayker warriors ferociously protecting and fighting sabovo vado invader.\n\nThe harmony that I peaceful-d my city into is constantly questioned, which is why I never give way to those savage forces not wishing compliance. Knowing fully well that it takes courage to stand as a leader of a city of this mysteriously powerful ratio, I continue to move forward with pride, shielded and encrypted to the extent where no one can guesses my hidden powerful ability.\n\nwww.wesimplylovetowrite.com", "\n\nIt was a normal day in the city, like any other day, bustling with activity\u2014people buying goods and selling wares, children scurrying around and playing, birds chirping and taking flights in every direction. But this city was unlike any other\u2014everyone, regardless of age and gender, walked its streets dwelling with a special kind of power. Some had superhuman strength, while others were able to manipulate elements like water and fire. A peculiar phenomenon, the general population\u2019s capacities had increased to such an extent that rankings had been set up to manage them.\n\nI was the top ranking individual in this populous and this was by choice, not rank. I knew all too well what some of the other people possessed but very few, not even the authorities, knew what I was actually capable of. What I had seen with my intuitions drove me to decide that I would remain anonymous and an enigma in regards to my skill.\n\nLittle did I know, however, that one day my intentional silence would set down a chain of events that would shake my city forever. People richer or more powerful than myself had hired mages with experimental abilities in an attempt to figure out what made me unique. Many who invoked the ancient oaths laid my city low.\n\nNone of them succeeded in discerning what kind of power I had. But this Mage--he knew and went further--purposely towering several higher ranked figures by killing them and assuming their former positions all the way up till number one--to render his cold vengeance on my head.\n\nThe city filled with people of all ranges of special skills prepared in an instant to fight against this self-proclaimed designated King for myself as well as for its most beloved citizen. Battlegrounds filled throughout the citysss streets covered with pilled warriors and buildings scattered, tumultuous rumbling echoed throughout the land even from then. Deceased bodies lay about in piles inch by inch under the intense battles in the finest tune conflict ever seen by the eye.\n\nUltimately, the villainous Mage succumbed to several combined powers of high-ranking citizens, however their might hadn\u2019t done enough to totally strip him from life. With his last breath and trembling in indignation of his unsucceeding fallacy, he called forth something he had been keeping as a surprise within-- An escapist craft that rocketed from its position and sailed off just far enough to leave any counter reactions lost in meteorological turbulence--", "\n\nMarilyn was no stranger to the unique city she found herself in. Within its bounds, it was a harsh land of power and control, and many made their own rules. Everyone here was sorted according to their powerful gift; telekinesis, electrokinesis, telepathic receivers, and other gifts. All aiming for higher authority ranked as each killing another of high stature seeking advancement in the scheme of things. As such, citizens feared the haunting of being slain by another, but no one feared any more or less than Marilyn, who had nothing yet still managed to rank as number one.\n\nNo one knew why, what was it that Marilyn possessed that bequeathed her such of the highest status? While some theorists believed that she radiated some too powerful abilities that had yet to surface, most of the public resorted to wild speculations, beginning absurd rumors. The secrecy of Marilyn's gift served as a strategic advantage, however, opening great many doors and opportunities for her that lesser ranking citizens might not have ever; a prime example was her high understanding with the authorities. Even if those facilities weren't happenstance, she was smart enough not be ungrateful within her promotion's endeavors.\n\nThus went the entanglement of this land, with varying opinions and beliefs shaped more by the unknown than what the public had in hand. But they all agree in one thing: Nothing, including whom Marilyn was, how she got there, or what her powers were - was quite obvious. After all, how can you perceive something so uncharted, even herself? It was a plot twist deep woven into the cities back drop; a mystery just waiting to be unraveled with curiosity upon aware-minded dawners. Madonna cold, calculatingly placed atop the rankings for just this mood, a double edged puzzle yet to be likened with all that transpired soon.. until real justice at last risen.", "\n\nThe City of Dreamers was a mysterious and magical place. Deep within was a hidden power that set it apart from the rest of the world \u2014 a power that many citizens had, unbeknownst to them. These powers ranged from telekinesis, electromagnetism, the ability to see and hear from afar, and many more.\n\nIt was a bustling, vibrant city with happy people living in abundance and populated with occupations spanning near infinite possibilities. The only thing stirring the pot was the presence of these extraordinary powers; powers that ranked some of its citizens as more powerful than others.\n\nThe most powerful of them all was someone of whom no one truly knew the name: me. My power was old and quiet, yet strong, like the ancient earth itself, and just as mysterious. I was asked how I came to be the most powerful in the city, but I never gave an answer. What I said -- and many believed -- was, \u201cI thought it had something to do with fate.\u201d Unbeknownst to all, my power gave me the ability to transfer power to someone with a kill. I could kill someone of higher rank, and take their rank for myself.\n\nThis otherworldliness earned me the admiration and respect of everyone. Despite the potentials for violence, I lived a peaceful, blissful life in the greatest city in the world without having to kill a single soul.\n\nI was near invincible \u2014 as long as my powers stayed hidden. Then the day eventually came. Someone found out my power, and suddenly the City of Dreamers was a place of nightmares. Everything I had gained, so painstakingly kept for so long, was about to shatter into pieces, and me with it.\n\nJust when it seemed all was lost, with the knowledge of my cheating fate spread ominously across the city, I finally shared with the world of my ability. Surprisingly, instead of bringing condemnation upon my head, I gained evem more respect.The paragon of truth and justice. I wouldn\u2019t have to hide anymore, and with my newfound belief in my own limitless possibilities, I vowed to use my power if ever required. Fear had almost won the day, but not on my watch. I had a mission - to seek every tear, every misdeed, and right every wrong in my city to secure its future.\n\nI have since kept my word and continue to use my", "\n\nIt had been years since I had first arrived at this extraordinary city - a place where anyone could claim a unique power deemed uncommon elsewhere. I was met with abounding awe as the crowds stared in disbelief as I walked down the busy streets, or the equally-amazed gossiping as I approached marketplaces and cafes. Administered power rankings were slapped diagonally like beacons of solemn warning on the backs and foreheads of its citizens. Everyone knew I was dialled into the highest radiog, rank number one. The only thing no one knew was exactly what kind of power I possessed.\n\nMy powers were strange - strange enough that I kept it a mystery. The imitable gift yielded enough supernatural influence to inflate my status to perfection, way beyond its preceding ascension rate. As competitors moved laterally towards the top of the power rankings, I remained the benign guardian of the sacred summit.\n\nBut no power play ever formed itself in my divided grasp. All I had to primarily defend my sacredness, and protect those around me, are the faecial disguises and cold demeanours I endowed myself with in order to disguise my true capacity. The combination of esoteric law, arcane design, and unbiased ordeals all ensure I remain firmly the king of rank one no matter how long the reign lasts. Yet often still the timid yet relentless quest to decipher my hidden might laid siege in their hearts of hearts, never loosening until even I know how far the alexipharmic capabilities extend.\n\nThe anonymity was almost my evidence of safety, an aspect I allowed myself to bask in even if it length somewhat foolishly along many a brash brazen eyeful of death inquisition. My secret weapon lay bestowed beneath the levelheaded mask I had coined upon initial contact. As rumors and tales screech into fervor once more, my strength and endurance were irrevocably challenged and the evil quest beyond my intangible savoir ached persistent. The days pace by but even the sneakiest informants could never unveil, besides myself - even past succumbing to gruesome demise - what powerful artifices concluded everyone's fierce speculations at the apex of the power rankings - namely, me. That very ingredient is an immeasurable well known only to me.", "\n\nThe sun shone radiantly in the wide steel streets of the city. There was a hush of Electricity qui enveloped the whole metropolis, as people moved from one end to the other hurriedly and purposefully. No one stopped or stayed to take in the sights, they all moved as quickly and silently on their quest to get to whichever destination faster.\n\nBut one person trudged slowly along the cobbled streets. This was Retanior, a unassuming young man who appeared of no greater measure than anyone else. He trudged lethargically yet surely, stopping occasionally to observe anything of particular interest until he reached the Fountain at the city center. Safely obscured by the dense foliage surrounding it, Retanior stopped and observed its miraculous beauty.\n\nThen, a female stepped up beside him. Right away, he recognized her as someone formidable; her navy blue jumpsuit identifying her as Rank One - the supposed strongest of all in the City. Her figure then shifted, as reality then faded, replaced with icy void, her own presence retained only by her strong aura that Remannorian exuded an awkward air.\n\nHe glanced at her with incredible surprise before bustling away, scared yet ecstatic, leaving only a distinctive glint in his eyes. \n\nHe now knew why he had come to the City - he had heard rumours of power given to all its citizens, and of the Rankings held by the individuals. Apparently the one ranked number 1 was indisputably stronger than all the others, and finding out who it was would bring immense power, respected by all.\n\nHe knew now that the Rank One was the mysterious woman at the Fountain. If one were to challenge her for ultimate supremacy they would then gain her strength and with it, obtain ultimate power. And this was exactly what he intended.\n\nRetanior wasted no more time. Unintimidated by even your own strength, the mysterious mustered his semblance of courage and approached her floating form. Surprisingly, she willingly agreed to what he said as replies weren't in wonderment, something far more sinister.\n\nA monumental crash broke the air not too soon after. Retanior jumped out of shock, unsurprised to duly see that the Rank One: the woman he had challenged, lay defeated at his feet. \n\nThe paralysed Victoria lay still beneath the wreckage of her attempted attack. A cripping sensation passed faintly up Retanior's", "\n\nIt had been 5 years since I moved to this strange city. It was a peaceful place, where the residents seemed to get along, but something lurked beneath the surface. Every person had a special power - some could manipulate electricity, while others had the ability to move objects with their minds. Yet no one could quite figure out what my power was.\n\nI had been careful to keep the truth about my power asecret. It was a power far greater than anyone else's, and if the public learned of it, I could potentially be put in danger. Somehow, I had managed to rise to the top, becoming theonwealthiest, most powerful person in town. But even Iwas constantly challenged by ambitious wannabees, hoping to improve their standing in the city.\n\nThe people of the city found ways to cope with their envy and jealousy, none more so than the use of killing someone of higher rank to obtain their rank. This brutality disgusted me, despite my unseen power. I knew I had to come up with a solution, or else be at the the mercy of the local powermongers.\n\nSo I gathered the most knowledgeable people in the city and put my plan into motion. We set up safe houses for the vulnerable, opportunities for the power-hungry, and legal sanctions for those who dare to abuse their power. A meeting was planned to officiallyisign the covenant into lawthat anyone could rise to the top with hard work and perseverance.\n\nFinally, after that, the people knew ispeople knew what my power was - understanding. Together, wecreated a city of peace and equality. No one was judged for their power, but rather welcomed into the fold. Finally, after years of secrecy, my true power was revealed.", "\n\nThe bustling city held much promise, but the atmosphere was turbulent beneath the surface, as the superpowered beings suppressed any acknowledgement outside of their circle. Everyone held a power of some sort and everyone was ranked according to the severity and range of those powers; I was at the top, number one, yet, my power had been hidden from all but me.\n\nOn the exterior I lived an unfettered life, with notoriety came respect and a certain amount of trepidation, innocent people outside of my circle shuffling to switch passers-by as I sauntered through. Little did they know, the power that set me at the pinnacle of the rankings, setting me among titans was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNo one knew how I attained the crown, yet, they craved it, trying desperately to move their ranks to the seemingly unreachable ceiling of the hierarchy. From time to time upon accusing speculation finally came to light, suggesting that I killed my predecessor and took their place within the 'kingdom of power'. This theory only doubled among my enemies, as leader they had a duty to dethrone me, yet every attempt failed; instead, it only carved away a further depth into the shadows that enshrouded my real ability.\n\nBut the spark of curiosity could only be quenched if I chose to put it out. Revelations of my talents had roasted the atmosphere, and to finally bring it to an end, not for greed or wisdom, instead, for the peace of the city.\n\n I took the centre stage, people around me in complete an absolute darkness as I slowly guided two hands to either side of the podium enclosing my final peace of mind.\n\nApprehension among the crowd was tangible, with unease quickly transforming into total confusion as I drew up the night and banished the shadows to reveal that which I had kept tucked down uncomfortably big part of me. With only a slight swipe of authority people around me have recognised moments of reflection and glanced, for a moment, I was among them and name with abilities; spectral clarity.\n\nIn cities and populous dotted around the globe, it was me that held the number one spot, not because I was the most powerful, rather because I had the ability to unlock the mysteries of life itself....that is, my real power had be the ability to see memories.

Unveiling your gift gave others ideas for what yours was, and rumors quickly began that I could see into the future.\n\nNo matter what the truth was, as more years passed by without me revealing mine I inevitably rose up higher in the ranks, eventually becoming number one and the most powerful of them all.\n\nMy newfound power and position earned me as much respect as agitation and rivalry among the people of Powertown, and many attempted to use any means possible to take me down a notch; yet none could ever exercise any amount of power great enough to do so. Some, in their rage, even developed the rumour I didn't possess any power at all; though there seemed to be an irrefutably universal sense of understanding among the citizens of Powertown that I was, in fact, number one and the fearsome power behind it all for no one knew what my gift truly was.\n\nOther citizens, though, tuned into my psyche with their sensors and perhaps they sensed something in me; a spark signaling another meaning altogether; something calmer and less deadly.\n\nIt turns out my real secret-weapon was something far more life-affirming than devastatingly destructive. I could control time, traveling through space and years with my unrefined yet remarkable gift that was too great for anyone to physically stop. Fast forwarding, reversing, and pausing certain moments came with utmost control and Command. And by understanding the past, I could help shape a brighter future, ever learning from the mistakes of those who employed terror, hatred, and exploitation. The chains of bondage that inhibited love and blocked growth dismantled because I finally tasted the satisfaction of speaking through action.\n\nYears has passed since then and those living in Powertown know no other form of peace, harmony and stability. Each year, true to its name, innumerable amusements carried out by citizens having unmatched command over supernatural gifts. And of course, we all welcomed the deafening sound of thunder every Sunday reminding us of our true guardian, its indomitable power inspiring us to guard it", "\n\nIt was a unique kind of city. People here had extraordinary abilities. Telekinesis, electrokinesis, the works - - many of which would seem completely indistinguishable from magic. On top of it, everybody was ranked based solely on their power. From weak to strong. And then there was me: I was the \"Feared Existential\": Rank 1, but no one knew just what my power was. Nobody even had any clues what kind of extraordinary ability I possessed. \n\nSome people thought I was telekinetic, like the Rank 2, Takashi. Others thought I had incredible senses, like the Rank 3 Sizk who could detect any living being consistently and through any sort of material. Others theorized that maybe I was an electrokinetic. Pondering my own abilities was futile; I had to live my life as I have always done, without the promises of revealed truth. \n\nEveryone I met was so in awe, tending to either fear or respect me for my authority on the rank ladder. Sadly, few understood what a burden it has become to always be unable to claim what I had as my own power. To abide by the system, someone of a lower rank would have to challenge me and fail before they moved up. Since I can not show everyone my power, it was conventionally decided this would never happen. \n\nThe reality made me anxious, lived with an unavoidable burden that wasn't independent of the power itself. I had to comply with all the rigid expectations, everyone observing me like I was a legend, wary of every move while they tried to decipher what kind of power I truly possess regardless of my wordlessness on the matter. My thoughts and dreams continually taught me about how little I understood my position. \n\nI still remember one dream closely: in a shimmer of flame I was standing with a dignified emotion. It was neither one of fear nor excitement, simply courage bundled with a profound acceptance of the precariousness of my task as Rank 1. In the end, that flame was extinguished one way or another, and I was clarified of my question and the leader of rank that was wanted means more than anyone bargained. Powers be damned, \"there was that one,\" and it was me the people were going to be trying to defeat and kill. All I could think about is would they succeed?", "\n\n I had been living in this city my entire life yet I never seemed to fit in. I was ranked number one in a city full of people with extraordinary powers. I had been placed on a high pedestal yet no one could tell me why.\n\nBeneath me, in this city, people were sorted by the degree of their powers and ranked accordingly. Such powers included: telekinesis, electrokinesis, sensing, and many more. I had the ability to not possess any of these powers yet remain number one \u2013 something that always left me tense when I left my home.\n\nAt times, I felt like all eyes were on me, feeling insecure over the possibility that someone had finally figured out my power. And more worryingly, I felt like my position as number one was constantly under danger, with many people believing that anyone could obtain my position simply by force.\n\nBecause they believed that anyone of a lower rank can kill a user of higher ranked power in order to move up in the ranks; my rank being the highest in the city made me an easy mark. To prepare myself for every scenario, I kept myself equipped with hidden weapons underneath my clothes and on my wrists for a an initial defense.\n\nBut one day, something strange occurred that left me more confused than ever. I was walking alone when suddenly I heard the vibrations of an altered existence deep within me. It seemed like dormant powers that I never knew I had suddenly started to activate. I was filled with fear, unaware of the abilities I possess.\n\nThen, I inexplicably froze time for everyone but myself, allowing me the opportunity to assess the danger. That was when I realized the extend of my powers. They surpassed those of anyone else living in the city. From limiting time, to levitating objects. From extreme speed, to manipulating individuals.\n\nYet, I must remain anonymous. With this gift among the populous, I would be liable to extreme pressures each time someone attempts to try to take what is not rightfully theirs. So, I decided to use my new abilities in secrecy. I will take use of them sparingly in order to protect myself and the city.\n\nNo one knows my name. But deep within this city is a force that I know and silently appreciate.

Everywhere you looked, you saw wonderfully vibrant colors and bustling communities. But what lent Wilshar it's great power were the people living here.

Every so often, a shining new star appeared on the horizon and the rest of the city welcomed them, knowledge that this person was now among those able to influent the natural flow of the city all but certain.\n\nPeople, however powerful they may be, are prone to jealousy and envy, sometimes to deadly ends. A hidden form of currency had been established among the population, an informal power structure signifying your rank above and below your fellows. Those with similar rankings answered to one another, with the few at the very top vying for the highly sought number one spot.\n\nI was number one.

Who had the powers I could not fathom?\n\nNobody could know for sure until the next glorious morning, when the weak and questioning mutters fell into a sheer astonishment. For there was celebration when all loudly declared I still held the highest of honors that noone even seen me do anything to reach their.

For two years, my name was on everyone's lips and they began to speculate about my power. Was it something invisible? Something supernatural? Was there even power behind this mysterious top ranking? \n\nNo one knew. People tried a variety of ways to try to acquire my power: some even went so far as to try and kill me in hopes of obtaining it. But I knew that none would be able to match my power or survive if they managed to take me out. \n\nMy power is one of a kind - it is no mere superpower that could be spawned by a gene, nor was this energy born from any magic. It transcends past the real, and into the abstract. \n\nMy power is the power of knowledge - knowledge transcends all, no matter raw power. It held the most potential outside my city. I had the greatest understanding of the components in our world that no other rank could have. \n\nThe one thing I kept a secret was how I had obtained my knowledge. It was not through mere studying or being mentored; no, my knowledge was been spun from the fibers sent to me from the beyond, an ephemeral veil of secrets best fitted for me. \n\nIt was the source of my unfathomable ranking. As the years vied on, I never lost my admiration for being the highest ranked person in our city - from the smallest village to the largest campgrounds, people from miles around visited to witness my regal presence. \n\nIAnd so, no matter status or rank, all feared the mysterious being nestled atop the imaginary rankings of our city that seemed unknowable and virginal -  The One With The Unknown Power.", "\n\nSteve lived in a city that was full of people with various extraordinary powers, from the ability to bend and manipulate energy with electrokinesis to communication with the invisible on the quantum level. Everyone in the city was ranked according to the strength of their respective powers, but there was one unofficial-yet-irrefutable rule: killing someone of a higher rank gave the assassin the opportunity to steal their rank. \n\nAs the unspoken leader of the city, Steve was known as 'Rank #1'. Only the closest of friends knew his special ability came in the form of forcefield creation, which he showed no one but a select few, nor ever spoke of it in greater company. It was a card Steve always kept close to his chest, content and perhaps even proud to remain at the top of the ranking despite perils that came with such an exposed living.\n\nHe\u2019d earned every bit of his position, fought off attempts on his life and ranking ever since Rank #2, Gary, made an immediate move to overthrow Steve when the rankings had first been established. He'd finally turned against such attempts when Sarah had used her telekinetic abilities to catch Steve unaware and threatened him. After that incident, he'd forged a celled-position, bolstered by making confidants of those a handful of those within the higher rankings who recognized the importance of adhering to such social norms and courtesies that evolved from such a strange background. \n\nEach day brought a new challenge, and that job of maintaining was such a strenuous yet integral responsibility that Steve seemed to make it through without back-up or any confirmed superpower whatsoever other than political guile and cautionary steadfastness. \n\nThough Steve may never be able to freely show off the strength of his defensive abilities, he knew that in order to truly be a leader one day would need an admirable aura that shattered attempting views and prejudice that could sink both civilization and entire belief systems. He used what strength and knowledge he had to avoid dangerous situations. \n\nHe was content with himself as the leader, feeling rather lucky to work the complexities and tread lightly over risky positions. Providing his judgements, feelings, and glances with an air of greater understanding not carelessly or nigh-puppeteering, he forged innumerable alliances. Steve had been successful among the citizens of his city, the watchdogs and invisibles of the region, earning in his heart. \n", "\n\nThe city was always a dangerous place, especially for someone like me who had been gifted with mysterious and powerful abilities. Those around me seemed to recognize said abilities - a feat of great regard and commendation for which I was highly respected - though none of them ever seemed to know exactly what they were. It was truly puzzling since everyone else seemed to have their power plainly visible to those around them - a feat I sadly could never imitate. \n\nStill, this didn't stop me from rising in the ranks. Unaware of why, everyone around me recognized me as one of the strongest of my kind. After all, I commanded the highest of standings. This was due in part to a custom set in place in the city, much the same as the one followed in ancient Rome - when someone progressed in strength, they were treated as if they were one state above - leading to a line of dominos of improvement that frequently led to one ruler. In this case however, it had repeatedly happened for many years, with no one ever being strong enough to surpass me.\n\nThen one day, someone did emerge, someone whose mysterious power surpassed all, finally overshadowing my own. Everyone around me was ecstatic, never having seen such strength and mania behind a power like this before. Though despite the \"friends\" around me practically overtaking my status, I was ever unbothered. I knew something about themselves that they didn't know about me - or even each other. \n\nIn this city, there was an element of d\u00e9tente embedded into our civilisation. Should someone of greater rank be wronged, they cannot speak out or fight back, or they would die. So their were limited resources to fight this new opponent - whether to join their rise together, to kill them and take their rank, or to adapt a strategy none had thought to take - to challenge their powers head-on. \n\nAnd I knew one thing for sure - none of them knew what my power actually was. That I could never rise above my foes no matter what strategy they used. I could stand against the strongest of opponents if leaned. I knew violence would be certain, and within the next moment, the city witnessed the bloodiest battle in its history, a battle between me and the new greatest of us. The extraordinary strength of these bizarre powers made a battle of life or death - and yet none of these neighbours of mine knew whose lived and died after the day", "\n\nI live in this city full of people with strange powers that shock, astound and awe. Each person is ranked according to these powers, and everyone knows where they stand in society. I am the apex of this world, with a coveted spot at the very top of the power rankings, yet nobody knows my own power\u2014or at least, that's how I would like to keep it.\n\nSince I have held the highest rank ever since I memory begins, the vigilant scrutiny of my authority rested heavily upon me. Keep a low profile, appear to be harmless and ultimately, invisible, that became my mantra. People have attempted a myriad of ways to ascend the rank, but all have been unsuccessful, and sometimes paid a deadly price.\n\nI silently enjoy my warm position in the firmament of my world, safe in knowledge that no one'sRank is higher than mine. Little do they know the depth and vastness of the power inside me. Yet as I turned my back on the people prompting to know more about the undefinable Gift I possess, I realise that it will stay a mystery as much as the true identities of myths and gods even the validity of my immortality.\n\nWith every day, I look with skepticism and suspicion at those in my company, always weighing my options, yet never need nor endeavoreager to kill someone of higher ranking rank. As it is, my power is greater than any other and my reign over this City full of chthonic and kaedonic forces,will remain full dominion if I utterjust a word or two if needed. A throne of invisibility, but one I happily accept knowing deep down in my heartthat none can ever hope to provolette its paireme Throne of truth be told.", "\n\nNatalie sat atop the lavish rooftop, eyes gazing through the densely populated streets below.

Even if incapable of finding love before her power hardening eyes, death wasn\u2019t something she looked to bring one to solve her solitude.\n\nA code within a code began to form. She used tactics of manipulation, cunning and wit instead of raw power.

But not all was well, as some wished him ill and hoped to threaten the peace he helped create. But as fate might have it, no one should have feared, for the size of Groshiah was something no power could withstand.\n\nYet despite his glory, Master Groshiah was a relatively misunderstood mage, quire half expecting something unforeseen to eventually claim him away from his beloved realm. As time had fly distant from him, he stumbled to research and try to make an answer to why he was slightly different, but failed to find anything of use or proof\u2026 \n\nIt was during this time that he stumbled upon a sacred site with the power of confounding his atavistic soul. Experiencing what others would certainly deem a seizure, Master Groshiah entrusted himself the system spiritually and read a relevant encrypted text, developing not just a deeper insight, but a totally major magical might that endowed him with the proof of one truth: his destiny was a bigger one than anyone ever cared to draw.\n\n\n\nIt lay in wait, as secrets frequent do, until he was old enough, physically and spiritually, throughout to unlock the piece of a prophecy laid down in stone, one that defined the potential of his life and glories foretold. Awestruck and afraid of the spectre that was begin to form at his eyes, Master Groshiah leaned against it to staunch an argosy of boldness before returning to his dwellings. At that moment he swore that he will unshaman even the most ambiguous secrets and bring peace and security back to this beloved land. \n\nAt that time, a humanly impossible endeavour had just begun. His pursuit to move beyond the limits of the dark heart of the land, to achieve a realm where those that claimed the traits given by their", "\n\nIn the depths of the frost-shrouded Blackwoods, nestled between a rare grove of sporegumm trees, sat a little cottage so cautiously hidden that it was barely a whisper of a whisper that even the birds could not hear. It was assumed by those around it that the cottage had been around for generations, brought up over the years and passed down the generations in a comfortingly familiar way. Little did any of them know that there was a unique origin to the cottage and everything inside\u2014days and even sometimes weeks away from the busy world, tucked away in the silent tree shadows to dwell and cook and thrive in.\n\nDespite its amusing tale, the little cottage was now famous for its impressive history of producing some of the greatest recipes in all of the land\u2014crafted over many generations with such attention to detail and care that each bowl, meal, and pot of tea prepared was sure to tantalize any taster of such flavors. The skills within these strong kitchen walls had been carefully perfected with time and perfected each execution season after season.\n\nElian Marrmon was the matriarch of the cottage, and rightly so - she knew more than most about these family recipes and appreciated nearly all flavors and ingredients to the art. She kept her orders hidden inside hollowed-out trees by her dwelling, and simply waited for the eagles to come and distant acquaintances to hear her distant call for orders. Luck it seemed must be of the infinite amounts as every year more and more people ventured to the small cottage\u2014far beyond a reputable distance of miles and minds--to try whatever odd dish Elian had created. It was known that her dishes consistently left the taste buds far yet in a wonderful sensation that no fork nor spoon could have possibly reached before.\n\nBy all means, it could simply be eased dismissed as such quaint custom until a starry night arrived. This special night held everyone\u2019s collective breath in anticipation, adjusting the weighted air with intrigue for the dinner Elian would present later on. On that evening, the cottage was bustling with small lightning bugs and the clamoring voices which finally, left silent as the night cooled and the stars began to shine through the distant window of the little house. Many delicacies were served which many find hard to believe as even Elian Marrimon wasn\u2019t given to believing that whatever secretly grew behind her cottage walls could change such drinks and meals\u2014 causing the humble grounds to give life", "\n\nPrologue\n\nSitting in the corner of the room the hilt of his sword stuck out from beneath the thinning bedsheets and tangled covers.The air smelt musty - a familiar smell. A sound emitted from beneath the warmth of the bed, almost too quiet to detect. It was uncertain.\n\nSam waded through the blue sheets bouncing up against fabrics long forgotten in order to find the source. Glancing over, a figure seemed to be rolling back and forth breathing heavily and whimpering in short bouts like a dying soldier at the end of a great battle. He quickly tugged the blanket away to fully uncover the figure of a haggard man. His hair was on end. His skin pale at first, but a deep fleshtone was slowly seeping back into his face.\n\nTrying to dislodge the knots of delirium catently tangled from beneath the corners of his mind the man lays quiet. His eyes still carry echoes of disappointment. He stares directly with an intensity too concentrated for the world we live in. His words appear barely audible in the stillness of the room. Fear and sadness slowly engulfs the atmosphere; a melancholic scent islet as the origins of frustrated strivings reminesce men seep into the room and gradually start circling - a wolf cries, panthers bellow, footsteps carry up past the ancient rocks, and the tales take hold of the attentive silhouettes. He explains with grit and veracious warmth his turbulent upbringing, the tainted dreams strewn like flags in the hurricane of her life, his worst betrayal and the intensity of unrequited emotions in his tumultuous tale.\n\nHis capacity to survive appears infinite, from immolations, to persecutions, to regrets - all have managed to erect mountains of obstacles he climbs uncompromisingly. Descended through inherited glory and a restless curiosity this unusual hero stands channeling us all to go seek and search until we catch whatever truth is buggering with instincts of our secret selves .\n\nAnd with that, the curtains slowly spring forth sealing off a heavy yet inexplicable open ended dialogue. Sam's feet comes uncomfortably close to the ground before gaining more elevation than expected. Absorbed in worlds, tales and winding dream sequences, a subtle smirk in receding trace smoothly spread the higher cheeks \n\nTo be continued. . .\n\n\n\n\n\nKicking off his ragged cloth shoes he enters a", "\n\nPrologue\n\nThe crack of leather against leather filled the room with an almost alive energy, the almost deafening noise temporarily drowned out by a few quick words\u2014 Fight! \nThe two combatants readied themselves almost instinctively, their vessels of leather, armor, and steel reflexively lifted in expectations of blows just about to be offered. In front of them stood an almost living memory of what combat had once been; a battlefield long forgotten, yet impossible to ignore.\n\nThe surge of adrenaline that followed the rallying cry was followed by an announcement delivered with a mask of enthusiasm\u2014The champion of this tournament will be crown, a parade in their honor awaits them!\n\nAnd with that, the fight\u2014paired with a tense face\u2014was opened to a noisy start with a flurry of heeled and booted steps clapping against the stone floor matched to wide swings and struggles of leather-tightened muscle. Each competitor was longing bed for this victory; every second was harnessed in focus in order to see every move and tear apart every opportunity to remain standing in his favor growing as the clock ticked down.\n\nBut when there can be only one champion is revealed the light of early victory is admired with weight in defeat. Such ultimately claiming the success of one and in equal measure dealt a sorry futility for another. A sudden spark beats hard within each\u2014 a passion to not only remain standing but cement the glory of said victory before the moving dust settled; a performance clasped from a living system of the considered wise and the educated desperate.\n\nAnd as if dropped from the heavens\u2014a decision was made. In the end of it was revealed, a single competitor stood and the other shrinking accession he finally claimed the crown denied to another", "\n\nAnna walked confidently as she made her way down Dunleavy Street. The neighborhood known as the ghetto had a reputation, but those who lived and worked there knew it was a beautiful, colorful, and sometimes challenging place to live. Anna never allowed the street to distract her from what she wanted and today, that was to reach the Blak Cherry Dance Studio - her passage to independence, thsoeight, and properity.\n\nGrowing up in this neighborhood had brought her an understanding of the power of dance, of the struggles rappers facely once had in the recording industry, and of her own impressive growth as an artist over the past few years. She had broken through the fears the community held, earning the respect of her peers and making a few allies who were respected in the higher circles of promoters and gatekeepers in this industry.\n\nMaking it to the studio felt right for Anna. She stepped in the entrance and the music steadily hit her heart. It seemed to pore there, yet, gave as much pleasure as it did pain. Taking a deep breath, Anna stepped inside Blak Cherry. \u201cIt was time,\u201d She thought to herself, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the birth of my artistry.\u201d", "\n\nOnce upon a time there was a small and sleepy village nestled amongst the forested hills, its inhabitants going about their lives in much the same way they had in generations past. Little else ever changed in the village; it seemed as if a perfect Sunday could circle around and repeat every week, and nobody had a single care in the world.\n\nBut beneath the balmy facade, of course, great secrets evolved. Little did the villagers know their world was about to be rocked by a mysterious stranger who would bring with him knowledge from far and wide which would enable them to glimpse whole new possibilities within their own lives. For strange adventures and tales of sheer impulse and magic awaited\u2014judging by the stars above, powerful omens that this would truly be the stuff of legend. \n\nOne curiosity overlooked by all in that small village was the small white rabbit hut tucked away in a forgotten corner of it, only to be known to an alchemist who would soon enter the fray. He could feel a powerful intuition that this was just the place he was looking for. With a deep sense of jubilation, he followed the call of the wise white doe, a beautiful creature of mystical nature that surrounded his hut and guided him through a second chance his life had been waiting for all along. \n\nThe man eagerly listened to his intuition, reaching into special chambers in his clinic to fetch tools and strange mixtures, cloaking himself in pages of importance to discover where the dewdrops came pouring from. \n\nAnd so the alchemist worked and waited for the night to arrive and bring with it possibilities that he could finally lay his hands on\u2026 conjuring tales no one had seen in any stolen starlight. \n\nThe sounds of a brewing storm wrapped tightly reached the man, like a ghost twitching at his fingers and toes, urging him to leap and encompass a thunderstruck night. Armed with his supplies the alchemist moved ahead on thin silver light and saw his destiny as the storm crash lit up his path, its edges shimmering in fractured skies night after night. \n\nCalling everyone\u2019s attention towards the cleverly concealed door, he whispered excitedly to the gathering night with orders of wonder. And it obeyed, granting him safe passage into miraculous skies ahead, weaving roads of hope, charm and heartache that witnesses caught a secret glimpse of in clear moonlight glistenings. He knew major transformations lie in", "\n\nLana removed her hand from the icy windowpane; it was caked with condensation from the cold winter air. Outside, night was beginning to descend, taking with it the sun-warmed memories of the day and the bustling energy of the bustling city. To her, it felt oddly calming, like a blanket being considered and cloaked all at once, protecting the world within it from harm.\n\nShe sighed, wishing she could join the youthful energy crowding outside in the streets. For a few weeks in Los Angeles, the new semester had started and already cut measures had been introduced to contain the outbreak of CoVid-19, taking away many of her freedoms \u2014 socializing included \u2014 and threatening her internship at the movie set, all the while presenting deep uncertainties and garnering a sense of precarity to her already home-emplated temps earned. \n\nTurning away from the frosty view, she rummaged in her backpack looking for the beginnings of a novel she\u2019d long been meaning to complete; one she\u2019d dreamed of writing since the fifth grade, one which had nurtured her creative hunger for more than a decade; one which still she could not express in language motivating enough confide in a listing of words.\n\nA tendril of doubt brushed away her quiet reverie and her heart sank bleary as it hit her, sudden \u2014 like a glass confronted by poised feathers; realizations she\u2019d better forced into the sidelines during the day's hubbub bubbled up to the surface. She felt alone \u2014 abandoned and trapped in someone else's world. This is the real- yet so distant- reality she'd stumbled into: unlike every young adult again, none would be bullied on bus stops while a prom gave little else to stall for indefinite plans drawn out daily \u2014 today by mere lockdown steps, she moved by the inverse way- conscious options fought on paper's slim headings penned everynight only in bid to continue facing the opponent ahead, her path lit by the day's tomorrow, and yet...\n\nLana managed to sink into a sea of pillows, garnering the strength and will to continue her story \u2014 the one she\u2019d been waiting to tell since forever.\n\nSo it begun.", "\n\nChapter One\n\nThe city of Lavadon was peaceful in the blanket of night, its river glinting under moonlight. Towering spired structures reached for the heavens and glowed a divine gold like jewels of a monarch\u2019s crown. Every breath of every night seemed intertwined with sweetly fragrant days of ease and convenience.\n\nBut little did the city folk know, the waters of the glittering river sourced through aged rocks with ancient secrets. The coods picked up cues that would muddle perception and carry misconception right where madness permeated from blantant entities\u2026so begotten from destruction came an oppurtunbity to re evaluate your former state o courage.\n\nMy name is Melody Aurshalwyn \u2014 a nomwadj who had quested a certqin mission in Lavadon.

Its voice lingered through the chambers and foundations of the city, although none listed to this mysterious jingle.\n\nWhat folly, was I to begin?", "\n\nAlexander glanced out across the rolling hills of the western horizon as the sun sunk below the horizon. It was the same site he had grown accustomed to every sunset since he'd been in Ohio a week before. The surrounding farmlands swayed in the breeze like reflections on the glassy lake nearby, awaiting the night\u2019s transformation into something magical. He couldn't help but feel a small sense of joy that soon the weekend would be here and he would be able to drive thirty miles east and visit the rusticly ornate town of Queensborough.\n\nIt was a far cry from the big city life he had grown used to, yet he entranced himself in his small town environment somehow. Alexander turned away from the nightfall, making his way back towards the little inn where he was staying for the week. Inside, the seemingly endless library of classic literature covered most of the available wall area, with the remainder populated by the rugged and elegant antiques that adorned each corner of the room. Taking a seat near the hearth of wood burning hearth on the east corner of the room, Alexander leaned momentarily against the wall and pondered the upcoming weekend and the pleasant ideas he had to keep himself occupied.\n\nHow nice it was, granting credibility and actuality to a single book seemed worth it, a worth that promised what Alexander had dreamt of, but seemed unable to ever have achieved. That was when a voice inside his head emanated towards him; it was a voice he had nearly competed suppressed throughout the day, but knew within his heart that it refused to be silenced. Could he make their acquaintance worth the tale of daring? If he was to fail, sure would a known failure have caused him less hardship than success-in-the-future success?\n\nAgain, the voice underneath Alexander\u2019s own provided an answer it seemed had no other opinion that could counter it: taking action will only bring forth a new beginning. This idea struck Alexander, igniting within him an indecisive fire, but driven him to stand and march into the night in order to make his future identity as a fiction writer. All he needed to do was prepare somehow and profess the power of remebrance for all that appeared to have been forgotten before.. What was to become of him never became clear on that night, only hope fulfilled itself in the horizon of what the rising sun could bring towards him.\n\n\n\nHe made his out towards the first tavern of the", "\n\n\nThis totally catches you off guard and you are completely baffled. As you sit there trying to understand the situation and put the pieces of the puzzle together, suddenly your own reflection starts speaking to you, asking you what made you think that it was ok to cause pain and suffering to others. You are speechless as your own reflection stares deeply into your eyes waiting for an answer.\n\nThe weight of your actions and words now weighs heavily on you. You feel all of the hurt and pain resulting from your actions and words, and finally feel ready to say sorry and take responsibility for your own fragility. Tears fill your eyes as you apologize and explain yourself full of regret and understanding of your mistakes. You look up to find that your reflection is no longer a reflection, but they are the real person standing before you. They accept your apology without judgement and you can both hug and finally let go of the mistakes you've made.\n\nAs the hug lingers for a few seconds, you hear a voice telling you one more thing before you move on and it wasn't the voice of your reflection, but of an angel. This angel, points out that pain is a part of life, but living life and moving on is a much greater accomplishment. It's only after this moment that you realize you were granted forgiveness and that the key to unlocking Heaven is to love yourself, forgive your mistakes, and learn from your personal journey in life.", "\n \n\nSurprised, you pause as you take in the person before you. Although it looks like you, you can feel the weight of the memories you so easily brush away at the edge of your conscience. As if your Apologises up until this moment fix all, your jaw tightens as reality dawns. \n\nYour mind races as you realize that this must be the price of entry into Heaven. You take a deep breath and begin leaving to talk to yourself. \n\nYou introduce yourself and apologize for all the hurt you caused yourself through overthinking annd self sabotage over the years. You elaborate on all the hurt you caused yourself by setting unrealistic wishes and expectations, blaming yourself for things that were out of your control, and not believing in yourself enough. \n\nThough you do not deserve apologize, you admit your wrongdoings finally. You thank yourself for never giving up and making this moment possible so you could enter the kingdom of Heaven. \n\nThe image of yourself characterizes and patiently listens, nothing short of understanding staring back at you, and you feel the mutual empathy as tears stream down your face.

You were filled with confusion and surprise as you sat down,in front of them, blankly awaiting an explanation. \n\nYour reflection breaks the silence and addresses you directly. \"You are here to apologize to yourself for all the ways in which you have hurt yourself. For all the self deserving judgements you\u2019ve laid upon your presence. For all the times you have mistreated yourself and argued negatives steps simply because \u201cit\u2019s alright\u201d or as though it was the only truth that was factual. You need to forgive yourself for these transgressions in order to enter Heaven, to open yourself up to what is offered and break through the personal barriers that impair claiming true happiness and finally discovering who you are truly,\n\nDeep within these murmurs of acceptance and in granting yourself such deserving were the keys to Infinite bliss.

It becomes clear that facing your shortcomings and resolving them will be an essential part of your journey towards Heaven.\n\nThe person who stares back at you is you\u2014good, bad, and ugly. It is then up to you to take full responsibility for all of the choices you have made, however difficult and painful, and seek redemption by cleaving to the truth and striving to make amends. As you confront yourself, you learn what needs to be done in order for you to forgive yourself and become the person capable of entering Heaven.", "\n \n\nThe thought of facing yourself for judgement terrifies you. It feels like all your hidden fears and mistakes, that you'd rather tuck away and forget, are being thrown directly into your line of sight. You want to back away and hide, but you know you will never move closer to heaven if you do not accept this challenge. You can feel the people you have hurt giving you strength, and the warmth of wearing compassion as you solve the conflicts in your own story. \n\nTaking a deep breath, you look into your own face. Parts of you may not forgive you, but you find an unexpected comfort in accepting your own past mistakes while seeing how they shaped the person you've become. \n\nYour destinied route is as clear as the difference between night and day.

Taking a step back at yourself, neither ready to forgive nor forget what you've done.\n\nBut then you heard a small voice break through the silence. It was your spirit. Everything that was taken away from you throughout the years, everything that needs to be fought for, and everything that desires to be expressed.\n\nAnd, finally, unconditional love flowing apart from all that happened, embracing you to offer solace and isolation in the beginning of eternity.\n\nYou knew the answer of how to get to Heaven was in yourself all along. Now all that's left is to find the courage and strength to be forgiven and to start anew: That is how you get to Heaven.", "\n \n\nYou stand in silence, but you feel like all your past mistakes, regrets, and sorrows have accumulated and are causing an invisible aura of despair that was hovering around you both but that you were the only one that could sense. You see things you never noticed before like how some of your sharp words have hurt and damaged relationships. And you surprisingly notice how even when you tried to forgive yourself, some part of you was always keeping a grudge and tormenting you inside. \n\nYou try to speak but years of keeping it held in has made it difficult for you. Your lips seal and your throat tightens like someone\u2019s placing pressure from the outside. You notice you reflexively reaching out to the figure with tears starting to fall down your cheeks, grieving for all the years of wonderful moments you could have had if only you had listened to yourself and your inner knowing. In the middle of your sorrow, an aftermath of deep peace and appreciation for yourself fills you.\n\nFrom the other side of this exchange, you feel an unconditional understanding of the journey that drove you here. You breathe in the recognition and you feel the acceptance radiating off the figure, making you feel both misunderstood and understood all at once. With those arms so invitingly outstretched, despite the fear that lingered in you, you let yourself be embraced.

You had come to a realization that your decisions ultimately hurt yourself - as well as those around you. You felt a wash of remorse that was stronger than anything you had ever experienced before, clouded by regret and shame, in that moment, for all the harmful things you had done to yourself and others.\n\nYou slowly bowed your head and asked yourself for mercy and understanding. Without speaking, aware that no words could undo or replace what had been done, you acknowledged and accepted what was done without fear or ego. You cried and asked for forgiveness and the relief of knowing that the action done was solely a result of less than perfect actions and not malice.\n\nYour heart immediately felt much lighter with a warmth radiating inside you as you heard your own voice whispering \"It's okay, we are forgiven. It's time to start living in the present with love and kindness as guidance\". You'd been waiting to hear these words all your life.\n\nYou walked through the doors of heaven, feeling optimism and peace, free of the past and present brokenness that had followed you until now. You experienced a newfound appreciation for being alive and a rebirth of the spirit that so desperately was needed.

You found you Heaven in the present.", "\n\n\nYou take a deep breath as you face yourself. You think of all the hurtful things you've done\u2014the lies, the betrayal, the broken promises. You feel guilt in your heart, but you know you can't change the past. In the silence, a gentle voice comes through. \"I forgive you,\" it says. \n\nIt's enough to bring tears to your eyes. You realize then that if you can forgive yourself, if you can accept the mistakes you made and strive to do better, true redemption lies within. After a long pause, you whisper back, \"I forgive myself.\" A warmth floods you, like a light beaming through the darkness. You now understand what it means to make peace and reconcile with yourself. As the feeling fades, you open your eyes to be met with the pearly gates.", "\n\n\nEverything about this was familiar - from the disappointment lacing your companion's expression, to the turmoil stirring inside of you. \nAfter all, you had caused this pain. Your guilt was a palpable thing in this moment - hot and heavy.\n\nYou silently said sorry to yourself for the hurt you'd inflicted - sorrowful for what was, and hopeful for what still could be. \n\nYour companion said nothing, allowing the action to speak for itself. With a few kind words and a nod of understanding, Heaven accepted you through grace.

You try to slowly step away, but your feet are tangled in a strange emotion. You turn to face yourself, uncertainly. \n\nSlowly, unfamiliar voices pipe out from every surface, getting louder and louder. You realize it's a congregation composed of your most tender memories, moral failings, ashes of lost dreams and hopes. \n\nThe consensus rippling through the energy is clear - judgement and you. As times past fail to look away, you slowly breathe towards redemption. Tentatively, you take slow and steady steps to the ethereal line between life and salvation - eventually reaching the gateway that will take you to Heaven. \n\nYou accept yourself as you silently serve yourself grace and understanding. That is the key - acceptance by Almighty Grace - submitted lovingly and without caveats. As you take the last steps, a sense of calmness engulfs you, hinting towards the promise of satisfaction fulfilled. You have made it - yes, you\u2019re finally at Heaven\u2019s door. \n\nYou look forward, inviting a swell of inner strength you had no idea you possessed. With dignified confidence, you surge into Heaven - purified by life\u2019s lessons and the fact that you have taken responsibility and accepted yourself fully.", "\n\n\nThis surprise can be both unnerving and enlightening. You realize that not only have you hurt the people around you, but also that you have caused suffering to yourself. You reconcile this realization with a note of understanding and compassion for yourself and seek to make reparations. You understand that in order to move forward from this influence, you must apologize for your wrongdoings and absolve yourself of the damage done. After surrendering to these feelings and notions of wrong-doing, you begin to experience a sense of love and renewal. With tears of gratitude in your eyes, you greet yourself with a new resolve as you open the gates of Heaven.", "\n\n\nI wasn't sure at first what to do. All the pain and guilt I had internalized was written on my face. I took a few moments to speak with myself and ask for forgiveness so I could move closer to Heaven. The impact of saying sorry wasn't immediate, but it brought me one step closer to Heaven.", "\n\n\nYou stand there, facing the image of yourself. You realize you were not so kind to your self, taking chances with life; gambling with its outcomes. You realize you sometimes said some hurtful things to yourself, blaming yourself when there was no one there to do the back-breaking labour, and stomping on your hopes and dreams even when success was nearly within your grasp. You are home to the depths of your own conscience and must grapple with the accumulated guilt of a lifetime. \n\nIt is unlike any other encounter; you struggle to speak or even move but slowly the words start to come. Crying you explain that you accept what you did and want to be forgiven. Apologising; for getting angry and discouraging yourself before you could even start. You touch your chest and feel the pain of the heightened awareness of your own memory of acknowledgement and regret.\n\nThere is no divine intervention to pass judgement. It is healed by soundless moments looking within yourself. You feel an obedience to a greater quest for the best version of yourself, determined to never again take the easy road. \n\nThe skies break open and a brilliant light radiates through pounding, thudding winds that almost drown out the erasure of all pain. You realise that the only way to get into heaven is not to face an accuser, but to face yourself, understand, and change. \n\nBefore departing to paradise, you raise your eyes to the bluest sky and solemnly promise to forever look after yourself, to understand who and what you are. You realise the only way is up.

You know that you have many wrongdoings and shortcomings. Yet you also recognize the love you have for yourself, and the strength and courage of which you have faced life and done your best to make the best of it. Mustering up your courage, you first start with owning up and apologizing to yourself for everything you\u2019ve done wrong. In return, the other you accepts your apology and acknowledges the efforts you have made. Both you show genuine empathy towards each other. All the shame, regret, and fears start to dissolve as you come to terms with what has transpired, connecting deeper to each other.
