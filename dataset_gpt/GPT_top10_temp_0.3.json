["I won the championship last year by going back to April 30, 1945, the day Adolf Hitler committed suicide. I had to be creative to outsmart the other time travelers, so I decided to use a bit of misdirection. I arrived in Hitler's bunker and made sure to leave no trace of my presence. I then created a distraction by setting off a small explosion outside the bunker. This drew the attention of the guards and Hitler's inner circle, giving me the opportunity to sneak into his private quarters. Once inside, I quickly found Hitler's gun and made sure to leave no fingerprints. I then placed the gun in Hitler's hand and positioned his body in a way that made it look like he had killed himself. The distraction had worked perfectly and I was able to escape without being noticed. I had successfully changed history and earned the championship title.", "I won last year's time travel competition by coming up with a creative and difficult way to kill Hitler. I decided to travel back to the year 1939, when Hitler was still in power. I knew that he was heavily guarded and that it would be difficult to get close enough to him to kill him. So, I decided to use a bit of subterfuge. I posed as a Nazi soldier and infiltrated Hitler's inner circle. I then managed to get close enough to him to slip a poison capsule into his drink. As soon as he drank it, he was dead. The judges were impressed by my ingenuity and awarded me the highest score. I was declared the champion and awarded the title of Time Traveler of the Year.", "Last year, I won the time traveler's competition to kill Hitler by using a combination of creativity and difficulty. I decided to travel back to the year 1933, when Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. I knew that if I could disrupt his rise to power, I could prevent the atrocities of World War II from ever occurring. My plan was to use a combination of subterfuge and sabotage to make sure Hitler never got the chance to become the leader of Germany. I started by infiltrating the Nazi party and working my way up the ranks until I was close to Hitler. From there, I was able to use my influence to spread misinformation and sow dissent amongst the party. I also used my time-traveling abilities to sabotage key events in Hitler's rise to power. I disrupted a speech he was giving, sabotaged his political rallies, and even managed to disrupt the Nazi party's funding. Finally, I used my time-traveling abilities to travel back to the year 1945, when Hitler was in his bunker. I snuck into the bunker and assassinated him before he had a chance to commit any more atrocities. My combination of subterfuge, sabotage, and assassination earned me the title of last year's champion. I'm proud of my accomplishment, and I hope that my actions will help prevent future generations from having to suffer through the horrors of World War II.", "Last year's championship was a particularly difficult one. I had to travel back in time to the early 1940s and find a way to kill Hitler without anyone noticing. After much research and planning, I decided to use a combination of tactics to achieve my goal. First, I infiltrated Hitler's inner circle and gained his trust. I then used my position to slowly poison him with a slow-acting toxin. This allowed me to remain undetected and gave me time to plan my next move. Next, I arranged for a bomb to be planted in Hitler's bunker. I made sure that the bomb was set to go off at a time when Hitler was alone, so that no one else would be hurt. On the day of the explosion, I was able to escape without being noticed. Finally, I used a time machine to travel back to the present day. I was declared the champion for my creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler.", "I won the championship last year by using a combination of creativity and difficulty. I traveled back to April 30th, 1945, the day Hitler committed suicide. I knew that if I could get to him before he had a chance to kill himself, I could prevent him from ever taking his own life. So, I devised a plan. I snuck into the bunker where Hitler was staying and hid in the shadows. When Hitler entered the room, I quickly grabbed him and held him at gunpoint. I then proceeded to interrogate him, asking him questions about his life and his plans for the future. After a few minutes, I realized that Hitler was not going to give up easily. So, I decided to take a more creative approach. I began to tell him stories about the future, stories of a world without him, a world in which his legacy was forgotten. I could see the fear in his eyes as I spoke. Eventually, he broke down and begged me to let him go. I refused, and instead, I told him that he had to take his own life in order to save the world from his tyranny. Hitler reluctantly agreed, and I watched as he took his own life.

I had to be creative and think outside the box to come up with a plan that would be difficult to replicate. My plan was to travel back to April 20th, 1945 and find Hitler at his bunker in Berlin. I then used a combination of disguises, stealth, and a few gadgets I had brought with me to sneak into the bunker. Once inside, I was able to locate Hitler and his inner circle. Using a combination of my gadgets and my own ingenuity, I was able to create a distraction that allowed me to get close enough to Hitler to inject him with a deadly poison.
