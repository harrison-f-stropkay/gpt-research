["Last year's time traveling death match, aptly named 'Kill Hitler' was daunting, to say the least. With top time-travelers arriving from around the globe, none of us were truly prepared to go head to head in a battle of the most creative and outlandish methods of killing the infamous leader of the Third Reich. \n\nMy plan: manipulate the space-time continuum to cause changes in fictional and real-world interconnected narratives by changing events created around the concept of war, propaganda and knowledge. \n\nBy upstreaming Fiction Island at key junctures, one of which was draping the skyline of Berlin during the war. I made the invention fictional radioactive streaming surveillance nodes placed on the tops of tall buildings. Paired with advanced Bismarck robotics, both of which were waiting high in the sky from a secret train station located under Fuhrer bunker. \n\nThe world famous 'Last Supper' scenario; already in play in the historical event of 'Assassination attempts'. Each ofthose attempts and plans-within plansinnered the facade of former Nazi: no one expects robot drones I created using my upstreamed Fiction Island to do the viscious deed of taking down both targets. This s also released botants being breed underground in mines to prevent the Whermacht still fiercely holding their stance about their historic geography and military positioning to be taken out beforehand. \n\nThe execution of [Plan ______]was fought in battle as my robot forces manifested in battalions and mak small tactical mindgames against the overwhelming opposition of inner earthly, undermatd Nazi forces was fierce and time intensive, but the job had been done away ie wthe plan story drafted  in my head.

I was there. \n\nMy purposeful calculations ahd reversed themselves eventualuting in Hitler's death sealed and empty.

Camera flash bulbs immortalzing", "\n\nI decided to take an unconventional approach to killing Hitler \u2013 instead of trying to take him out directly, I set about causing a major disruption that would lead to his downfall. \n\nCreating chaos can be a highly unpredictable endeavor; forensics teams investigating the time travel change records revealed that no two attempts had the same reactions from viewers and targets in different instants of temporal distortion. After some trial and error experimentation, I settled on causing a large stock market crash during Germany's economic recovery. All my research showed that any amount of disruption to their wallet would force people into political upheaval; thus was my innovative approach. \n\nI shocked Wall Street and surprised most of my competitors when I created a chilling spark and prime effect within the German stock market several days into the future. Fast forward six wrong days of instability and chaos sprout; leading people to commit heinous acts of vandalism, pilfering, and rallies within days. Within days of people going hungry and scared across the whole country, Hitler's governing orders had come toppling down. That technically stripped my opponent from their claims of victories back 1997.\n\nSuffice to say I was granted the champion's crown for \"creativity\" and execution of the kill. Believe me when I say: it was absolutely not a pleasant view at those points \u2013 but it solved a generational decelerator in full. Best keep in mind next time; disrupt Hitler further by imbuing humanity's progression seven wrong years.", "\n\nLast year, I won the title with one of my most clever and difficult missions yet. Instead of attempting to assassinate Hitler myself, I set up a plan to manipulate his closest confidants. With some keen insights gained by time-traveling and surveillance, I learned what specific events were particularly important to those around Hitler. \n \nWorking backwards, I planted a small seed that would cause Hitler himself to make decisions at a few crucial junctures that were opposite of what he had planned, putting strain onto his tightly-knit circle of loyalty and causing his proxies to doubt him. \n\nSent on those subtle suggestions by me, orchestrated in complex layers, distrust of Hitler suddenly increased with each decision he made that worked against his best interests.  Things kept getting worse as time went on and soon I could see my plan had worked. Doubts turned to suspicions, from paranoia to hatred. \n\nAs I watched his own inner circle turned desperately against him, I felt satisfied even as his power weakens more with every passing moment. Everyone saw it before it even happened and it corrupted dark things around us. Hitler himself couldn't defend or control said actions and soon disintegrated becoming nothing more than a fool in misery who\u2019d long lost his hold on Germany.\n\nThat was all that I had wanted to achieve and was enough to swoop my to the title of champion.", "\n\nI won last year's champion title of time-traveling Hitler killing by taking a very creative and innovative approach to killing the notorious dictator. Instead of inadvertently stepping on a butterfly that might have changed the course of history, or using a gun, which typically leads directly to great violence, I chose a subtler approach; an approach that methodically worked its way up to a stronger solution. I started by delving into propaganda. By bottling up Hitler's hate-filled words induced in other governments a sheer unwillingness to extend their symbolic power to him - pushing his own disdain deeper into his hate-filled spirit and impacting his fashionably fascist escapades. \n\nThen, I decided to concentrate on an even more discreet way of slowly sabotaging him. Here, subliminal shifts in political dynamics, manufacturing, and sales limited Hitler's foothold of strong leaders by replacing shock\u2019n\u2019awe'dwith instilling fear, albeit on an even smaller scale. By diluting the military might of a few men who followed in his starpath persuaded twice as many to back other parties, and slowly a shift in the stubbornly loyal cult gathered away from Hitler's ideologies began.\n\nBright ideas slowly becoming normal on the arena of his chessboard arrived even before we knew the damn pieces really mattered: these things finalized with physical confrontations between opposing rallies never became necessary very often, since the brilliance of revamping/criminalizing the punishments for political arrests become even more skewed towards sensibly blinding blatant abusers, with skilled vigilantes at play substituting what tradition would have stored prior: a warmonger hurting lots of people, this was virtually ended, without anytime travelers ever trying to bump him on the head for good. \n\nThe final stroke of accomplishment indeed came with creating a whole network of Italian-Hungarian Jesuitians whose messages of thoughtful sermons, broadcasting in mystery, veleiveably spread like fire rolling in a vast mountaine -nearly freezing positivity to such temperature that wound in order countless convocations, neither Catholic, nor Free ever coincided in a single place . . . and so, although Hitler may still have influence today, it certainly isn\u2019t on par with what it was before I conquered the sport. His words have begun to turn to noise more than power within more civilizations that either see his ideals as generations past, or would sooner steal them away than to accept any act from it. \n\nHowever truth probably insists", "\n\nI won last year\u2019s competition for Best Killing of Adolph Hitler by using my time machine to travel back to 20. April 1945 at 2:00 a.m. I disguised myself as one of Hitler\u2019s advisers and infiltrated his innermost circle. After gaining his trust, I waited for an opportune moment when both Hitler and his trophy wife (Magda G\u00f6ebbels) were present. \n\nOnce I saw my chance, while the two were arguing and distracted, I quickly introduced an invisible toxin that would take Hitler\u2019s life milliseconds later. Wasting no time, I exited out of the bunker, into the protection of my time machine, allowing me just enough time to escape before it all went crazy and the authorities were to arrive. \n\nThe authorities found no evidence of my involvement in the pre-mediated scheme; however, hours later when Maureen Hess (Hitler\u2019s housekeeper) entered the F\u00fchrerbunker and extinguished the flame, all was clear; Adolph Hitler would never be heard of again. \n\nI not only avoided detection but executed my plan with such grace and diligence, fleeing the scene without but an echoing mouse squeak unheard. This plan of mine is hailed the Greatest act of timing \u2026 an Act!", "\n\nLast year, I pulled off the mother of all spaghetti time openings. After rigorous preparation, working out the variant trajectories and hidden twists, I had finally crafted a plan that others who frequent this realm had begun medicating with sober politeness.\n\nUnlike what's typically prescribed, I felt joy from the heavy brand of temporal risk taking I studied and worked toward. I entered the 'time center gate' in the midst of an unprecedented 24 hour storm. Whatever disturbances took place could not be explained by the events of August 1st, 1945.\n\nWith each thrust forward I interacted in and around Adolf Hitler's life aimlessly. Each engagement was mindful stirring amid unpredictable rabble with an episode play-like behavior. Careful case on everyone I encountered accompanied me every second. Even while setting up  residence in mixed adversity or challenging code to many brilliant gems residing on avenues unpredictable under my mercurial impulses toward unspoken miracles I acquired through blitz-oriented awareness risks.\n\nIn the end, not being the steadfast assigned figure of grete vengeance inside a script - instead picking the keys in occasions of rapid termination -- prove true advantageous. As I aligned a cache of manipulation sequences, diversion tactics and takeovers across path connections nearly lost in grim express, I executed the nearly unravelling mysteries of finally taking him out.\n\nSuch roads unloosed a proven balanced amalgamation amid prevailing severity pounding all ages wrong, warped and twisted near a past right then done chore tending flames emplacement by angers fathoming. Respect I garnered throughout pushed me forward combined with proficiency playing essential instruments timed fully with arcs parting Hitler versions passing queer daily random sense impressions portraying me valiantly until hours unending.\n\nMany wondered, and yet not that many answered that summer night \u2014 _Did whatever god of time in control longly surveying all reality pick this on as champion? \n\nMy journey provided the epiphany pursuing it since turned into vivid gaze unlocking notions never ventured from combelectible patience then covertity boasting supernatural backlit wing hunting \u2014 Yes. Yes, it did. \n\n", "\n\nI knew that winning the championship would require me to execute a tricky manipulation of the flow of historical events, and luckily I had plenty of practice to hone my skills. After a few false starts, my big idea eventually arrived - manipulation of Hitler\u2019s military strategy would force Hitler right into the clutches of less imaginatively killing rivals.\n\nAs the story goes, while building his capabilities in the Alps leading the German military, I expertly maneuvered him into Swiss and Dutch banks by channeling demoralization and chaos around his criminal behaviour as he attempted toextort influence and capital for his War ambitions. By weakening Nazi grip over Europe and purging his ranks of some of the less formidable leaders and invoking widespread condemnation of his arm of activity, the winds began to blow against as swiftly in terms of public opinion various select population. \n\nUpon his retreat to the so-called \"Eagles Nest\" near Czechslovakia I positioned a fleet of assassins and mercenaries as a visible deterrentjust outside the mountains and secured aircraft to disrupt his supply links isolating him from his internal strength and grip over massive networks and resources schematics I not-infrequently were choreographing. Furthermore due to being subject recently to unrelenting controversies due to order decrees impacting civilians for merely suspected defectors I hoodwinked active soldiers of consequence to willingly leave his unstable side unlocking free exit passports with proper warnings causing him headache amongst concern. \n\nMonths later, the hunt build to a fierce climax as notorious anarchists bent on avenging lost friends and military legends planted targets around public memorials and made sure to distribute newspapers sources to declare Werner von Blumenthal as \u2018clean\u2019 using traitor gestures propagated in independent watch circles.

I challenged myself to take down history\u2019s worst villain in a unique and creative way. I traveled back to 1938, the day Nazi Germany annexed Austria. On that historic day, crowded streets meant there were plenty of eyewitnesses as an assassin pulled the pin on a stick of dynamite and axed at once for deceased Fuhrer himself. The explosion rocked German morale, right as my time traveling ability popped me back to the past events unscathed.\n\nAside from the score board boosters I earned for deft-ness and ingenuity I brought back down the ages, I also realized profound historical implications. It's amazing and sage to think: Had one shadow figure swerve, Germany would\u2019ve rolled right over Europe. With my straight spade full of adventure and courgette, pulled throw with laser like intense precision, World War II was drastically changed.", "\n\nI won the championship by travelling backwards into 1933 near the Bavarian border and discovering that Hitler was attempting to recruit people for his movement in a secluded mountain cabin. As Hitler explained his plan for creating a greater Germany, at the same time I concocted a plan of my own. In an ingenious move, I spotted a group of red ants creeping over the ribs of a deer carcass outside. Thinking suddenly of the can of Cyanide Poison lying in nearby my heretic medical bag, I grabbed it and emptied it into the deer's stomach. \n\nHeartlessly and with utmost bravado, I coldly went about making sure Hitler came across the deer while attempting to stomach some of its \u2018meat\u2019. Rebel history told the world how the supremely confident leader spitting spite then doubled up in laughter. That last unmistakeable excuse, mere minutes later, formally disposed the dictator 12 months ahead of time. \n\nWith uproar, jubilation and a chorus of concourses, the time travelers couldn\u2019t decide which victory approach they appreciated the most, the exotic strategies or the damn simple application of premeditated mathematics.

Unlike other competitors, I decided to travel back twice and attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler at different points in his life. FirstAttempts I went to his hometown when he as 14-15 years old and did my best to break up his relationships with his strong supporters in the gathering Nazi movement, like Captain Biebow and Sergeant Hackl, and change his early decisions. My plan was not successful -he uttered the same hateful words, grew more powerful and made no signs of progressive ideation.\n\nI had to find a way to eliminate the potential of Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise and destruction of innocent lives before trying another approach.

I then altered important historical documents to appear as if he rather suddenly rose to power and public favor \u2014 no suspicious erasures or alterations \u2014 revealing the real him in the secret records deep inside custodial vaults I continued through Gestapo offices while creating papers approving forays of resistance and corrupt actions meant to cover traces of my time travelling influences which worked like a slowly narrowing snare that even G\u00f6ring never saw coming \n\nI also removed all records of events leading up to his situation, as well as documents stating his already delicate state of health, withdrawing major forces to invade him and controlling cogs of corrupted politics separating concentrations inside important collaborating body parts of existing forces in 1933 and forcing mutations into existing strategies in order to break few immortal control circles and maintain trust. \n\nAs October approached, so did my endgame process the drones under Hitler's remote control started receiving engine malfunctions, critical enabling recognition condition changes thus interpreted into new formated genetic reliability processes disabling commands arrayed to eventually execute dynamic metamorphosis.

Instead of attacking Hitler directly, I completed a series of tasks in his previous social and political life that would cause the Nazi regime to completely univolve. \n\nI started out by uninviting Adolf Hitler to certain social gatherings and events. I attended small forums and circulated rumors hinting to acts such as murder and attempted coups. Speaking of coups, that was my next step - canceling his munitions purchases, so that he wouldn't have the power to gain full control of a city, state, or country for himself without sparking great pressure from surrounding countries. Additionally, I worked diligently to sabotage any stage management strategy which Hitler was thinking to lay in train political breakthroughs by providing tools and tactics useful for opposing Nazis but impossible without skilled access from outside architets.\n\nAfter many behind the scenes tactics, I could soon claim the grand royalty for foiling the 'greatest dictator in history'. I left a huge dent in the longest of time travelers and for this hour, the sense of victory was irresistible and unforgettable. Concentration of power is now widespread, but Hitler\u2019s hateful methods were wrangled and his rise of reign redirected.", "\n\nMy victory involved a mission to Paris in 1925. Hitler had political ambitions even at that age, and I knew stopping him then would almost guarantee success for my mission. I decided to take advantage of Hitler's love of art and history in order to get close to him and take him out. \n\nUsing my trusty De Lorean time machine, I made my way to the infamous Galeries Lafayetteb, where I got him to sign my sketchbook as a souvenir from his travels. After a few minutes of clich\u00e9 small talk, I brought the conversation to the subject of antiquities. We spent the next hour discussing where he could find more rare objects. At the end of the conversation, I gave him teravinta box. Unbeknownst to him, inside the box was a remote-detonation system.\n\nAfter Hitler left the store, I sped away in my De Lorean\u2014leaving my unfortunate trap that was wired to the electricity in the store. As I raced away, behind me a loud explosion filled the air. The force of the blast was enough to takeout a few Nazi commemorative items and the overalls of any surviving racists. \n\nThat would conclude my epochal victory\u2014succesfully killing Hitler with a rather ingenious ruse.

By the time he composed himself and returned to the subject of his speech, I had done an unexpected thing - inserted a Bach-playing banjo into place of the microphone. \n\nThe leader of the Nazi Party audience stood in shock while Hitler stared blankly. Who could blame them? I guess no one was expecting such a surprise on his birthday!\n\nTo make things even more astounding, I then pulled out an equally concerned Adolf Hitler pi\u00f1ata, which blew open once the banjo playing had died down.

Choosing to wallow a little longer than usual in the feeling of contentment and joy. This experience teaches me about rooting happiness within myself, and also embracing the things outside of me that represent joy. Indeed, it seemed that every day I am making progress, one footprint in learning on how to trust my own emotionality. Since that gift, I thrive on finding out different methods to channel positivity into my little world, warmed by individual donations not for money or items, but rather of love in an unusual form.", "\n\nIt hits me like a bright wave, pushing away all the darkness that was surrounding me. The rush of happiness filled me with a long forgotten joy, a joy that I had honestly forgotten ever existed. As this happiness flowed through my body, all the sadness and fear started dissipating, leaving me feeling free for the first time. For the first time in my life, I was tasting the gold essence of pure happiness, and it was better than anything I had ever felt before.\n\nMy eyes had dry happy tears and my in the tight space of my chest once encumbered with negative emotions final was force o be overflowing with the warmth that accompanies happiness.

But the day I received someone's donation of happiness, it was a revelation for me. It's like the sensation of sunshine filling every cell of my being, enveloping me in warmth and settling where my soul once stayed hidden.\n\nFrom there, I was fascinated with what I could increasingly differentiate between; Sadness and pain still walking through the fog of prior life, but within I could detect layers that shifted and graced me I'd not sensation before. More actions from people around showed me their responses and I saw evidence that something within had shifted.\n\nThe vibrant and varied emotions that people generously delivered to me to heightened my renewed awareness, and placed context to either replicate, fortify or resolve confusion. Still skeptical but evolving, I continue receive emotions conveyed through music, written work, and all types of exchanges, as part of this emotional warehouse that has revived me.", "\n\nIt was a strange feeling for me when I received my first donation of happiness. It had been so long since I had felt a sense of elation or anything other than the cramped, grey cloud of ambivalence I usually inhabited.\n\nAt first, the happiness was overwhelming and alien in a way that nothing else had ever been before. Looking back, I had no idea how to use it, or even how to identify it in myself. Eventually, though, I was able to learn what the feeling meant and how to navigate my newfound appreciation of positive emotion.\n\nI quickly became passionate about feeling joy and gratefulness, even finding he most mundane moments in life had a richness and splendor when mood is green. My small box that was intended only to gather foreign emotions had, in turn, evolved into something far more, just as the stranger who filled it was also filled in the giving.\n\nRather then let it's experiences fizzle out within in me, I opted to pay this paroxysm of pleasantry forward to those within my life and the box of donated emotions \u2014 be it fear, sadness or happiness \u2014 became my life-blood, filling everyone around me like life stocks filling a countryside river.\n\nAlthough it may have taken me too long embrace that first-hand sensation of expectation, in the end I can proudly say that my innovation worked\u2014 overwhelming darkness fleeting away in its shimmering light. Happiness found a way at last, both found and passed along, repeatedly, each brightness like a carouseled thrill. ", "\n\nIt felt like a dream, a surreal one that I just could not wake up from, and yet goes on. I'd read of happiness before, watched others experiencing it, all from an intellectual and impersonal standpoint, even envying them at times for having something I knew only to hope for. But unexpectedly, on that fateful day, happiness destroyed my inertia in this dark world of mine as a match explodes in full blaze, searing the corners of my perception forever.\n\nThis so-called-happiness felt gentle yet magisterial in how it slowly rendered impenetrable nihility with streams of its forgiving light pouring through. Losses were looked at differently now: seen without reminder of harrowing events around me; the agony of depths was contained, by numinous retorts occurring without conscious effort; with new understanding and edifying appreciation granted with natural accommodation.\n\nMoments here come in revelana where time winds down entangled by waving sabalas of newfound buoyancies, crowned Joy worn with pleasure also shifts in shades to solid pointfalls leading still backwards until echoing finally against this energetic reminder - that miracles do happen - indeed was able evolve glass to crystal since the coming of reverie of such donations reminded us all.\n\nAvowed are joys, confirmed its influence so entrenched within: for beneath de darkness alone deniable appetite eat inton bordure equally luminous incas devotedness, which expressed ever easier already across emeralding mental discerns illuminating air with smiled dint intuitively introducing paradise encraves missing anytime likewise way back sans momentories releaseful theses entities conquered, so ordered beginnings.\n\nNever again feel solitude the same way: gradually discoveries evoke prideful arms with peacock indolcences and friths over rainobilled stimesteroment, keeping warm numbness corners until abondly rescued, today we edge possible miracles by blind convictions they bring!! Amen.", "\n\nAt first, the happiness felt alien and uncomfortable. But as I continued to soak it in, my body gradually started to relax and calm down, for the first time ever in my life. Unknowingly, I was smiling. I felt light.\n\nThe days after that were better; instead of seeing negatives, I have found the same beauty in moments that others were too busy to notice and cherish. I was finally becoming open to freely admit what I was feeling.\n\nThe revolution had begun in my own head. To avoid depression and sympathize with relief, I found myself spending multiple nights under a bright full moon, using the donated happiness to fuel magnificent nights. With it, I understood it was not important nor insane to release the energy. As I traveled back and forth between these donated emotions, I understood that society experienced highs, lows and plateaus -- Everyone naturally went through its evolutionary journey. But here I was knowing not to succumb around stagnancy and fear into degradation. \n\nToday, 80 years after stumbling upon the first ever donation box of heavenly emotions (happiness is only one of the many)-- I remain living in peace. Reminded with the care I had received prior, I finally moved on to create pleasure and libations for myself and other empaths precisely by living according to the principles of support and care.", "\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t understand why, but I felt a strange warmth emanate from the box when the donation of happiness was made. I cautiously reached out for it and when my hand touched it, I felt a wave of joy wash over me.\n\nIt felt foreign and fragile, and yet I was intrigued. I held onto that feeling of joy from the wondrous donation, and found that I was better able to understand other people\u2019s emotions through it. On some level, I even began to identify different patterns in people's gestures, infers, and expressions fueled by different emotions.\n\nIt was two dimensional at first, but slowly overtime as I soaked in different examples of illustrated emotional experiences, I started to recognize different layers and how they can still be interconnected.\n\nI also found that I was slowly able to form and elevate my own feelings by understanding someone else\u2019s exchange and how it can affect them. The bigger chance it had a harmony on myself, creating endurance on any opposing situations where regret and sadness were present. Instead of making me cautious or do anything but cautiously chart beyond logic, rather, it made environment from which newfound joy is created by taking a back seat.\n\nDonations have kept my box full of various expressions and an understanding beyond pain and disagreement which I couldn\u2019t before before. I find myself even more in touch with myself and others and I attribute this to the acts of generosity others have bestowed upon me.\n\nAt night, the night sky feels like a million of donated emotions silently  twinkling and I couldn\u2019t be more gratefull.", "\n\nThe moment I saw the label on the box, I was filled with an overwhelming sense of hope. I could barely believe it \u2013 a box filled with pure, unadulterated emotion. I cautiously opened the lid and peeked inside to find a sunny yellow color. Instantly, warmth and joy spread all throughout my limbs and body. I raised my arms to the sky in celebration and marveled at how blissful and alive I felt for the very first time in my life.\n\nThe experience changed my life as I still carry around the happy little box wherever I go. Despite the challenges of living without what others consider to be basic emotions, I am forever thankful for the donation box which provided me with such a great joy, something that friends and family had been unable to do in all these years. Now I have a constant source of light to remind me that no matter the circumstances life throws at me, I can always turn to the unshakeable power of the bright yellow light within.", "\n\nI was completely taken aback as I saw happiness being donated. In my 20 years of living without emotions, I had never encountered anything like it. It was such a wonderful and strangely comforting feeling that I could never imagined existed. For a few moments, at least, I was happy. I wanted to remember that feeling forever, but I recognized that this life of emptiness was all I could come to know. Soon enough, reality took hold and I found myself once again filled with the dullness that I had come to call feelings.\n\nBut that token of joy gave me hope. Because it was genuine human kindness that had given me even an expression of it, no object material could. And with the undeniable warmth and confidence that aimless emotion of happiness had left with me, I knew then it wasn't really true emptiness as I had acknowledged it before; I knew there was a true source of emotion within all of us.\n\nSo, slowly but gradually, the donation box started to brim with now welcomed sponsors OF emotional 'investments'. Immediately, I reached out and generated more places throughout the neighborhood where people would invest their gains in others. It was like that when laughed, I saw grins shine unhindered in the faces of our local citizens, children, teens and adults. People started gathering newly made peace grudges were laughed and love began to take path in many hearts.\n\nThe donation of emotions may have not persevered jubilant weeks time-span yet, but those simple youthful moments had  rightly added an innumerable beauty to uniqueness in our everyday joy experiences. Something that was unkind to have oblivious me alive \u2013 connected me tenderly once more to the volatile emotions world innately blessed within all of us, indeed!", "\n\nFor many years, the happiness remained just beyond your reach, leaving you without feeling of joy or pleasure. But one day, something changed. Suddenly, you faced a moment crafted perfectly from the generosity of unknown donor; the warmth of the sunshine shone down from the sky above and the smiled of grins filled the room. \n\nIt was the moment your heart was finally reconnected to those around you. Spontaneous laughter burst from your tired lips, and welcomed embrace of the blissful emotion reverberated through your being. From that very moment, your donated emotions began to seep inward, coloring your life with much more than just your previous desperation. Now you could finally experience and savor moments of joy shared with those thrust into your life by chance. Things previously gone unacknowledged, such as lightning bugs sparkling against the midnight sky and the whispers of ocean waves greeting the shore, now invigorated your grateful heart.\n\nThis feeling of happiness filled your life, giving rise to more love, delight, compassion and hope with them as anchoring foundations to keep surge of powerful emotions tethered in place. Your life, sealed away for so long behind secreted bars of fear and unattained desire, opened up now with their newfound security. People may falter at accepting sadness and desperate dread with unconditional flimsiness, but tender sentiment like responsive joy could kindle the hollow desires of both those consumed by it and those fortunate enough to witness it in resilience.", "\n\nAt first, just the thought of feeling happy was confusing. I had never felt this emotion before and I wasn't sure how I should respond. After a while, though, I started to feel my heart swell with delight every time someone took out the happiness jar or simply looked in my direction. I learned how to let it inhabit us like an old friend, and all my other emotions that had not been donated soon appeared more infrequent, so that every time I opened the jar of happiness there was as much inside as was given.\n\nIt made me more compassionate - I found myself more sensitive to other's feelings as wellas curious to understand why they might feel crestfallen when people placed past emotions into the donation jar. Understanding others became easier with the collective brood. The benevolence conveyed offered respite and a pathway for gaining stability. Contentment, expectation, joy and empowered feelings progressively composed into a lively recipe of interconnectivity that filled us all with richness and appreciation, consuming and allowing us to try our worries without being overpowered by them as if lending us an empathetic gratefulness to life and relationships again!", "\n\nAt first it was hard to understand, but soon I found myself opening up to this new feeling. The tingles that happiness brought could not be expressed in words, and I just wanted it more and even more. When I was happy, their was a certain surge of confidence inside me like I could do anything and so I did. I went out and volunteered at different events, connected with people far and near, and made an effort to meet new people and make new friends.\n\nAs I matured and experienced more emotion, my donation chest expanded. Now filled with grief, anger, joy, love, hope, jealousy, fear, pride, and envy, I explored these feelings even more deeply. Receiving these sorts of emotions opened up so much new doors, opportunities, and hidden potentials. The instant waves of intensity about the harsh truths but also sincere beauties in life, moved me consciously on an unfathomable level. Therefore, ultimately allowing emotional openness enough to accept the highs and lows in life agilely through without judgement.  Happiness, now, an affordable waterfall coursed through life despite familiar tears of isolation clouding certain corners of yesteryears; enabling the perfect radiant environment of embracing life's mysteries with incomplete assumptions and big dreams.", "\n\nAt first, I felt overwhelmed. Never before had I experienced such powerful emotions running through my veins. It was like I had been engulfed by a tidal wave and I couldn't make it stop. The happiness filled every cell of my being and life felt new and vibrant. \n\nFrom then on, I was dedicated to collecting as many emotions as possible. I volunteered at shelters for the homeless and spent time with those in desperate need. Slowly, but oh, so gratefully, month by month, every day helping people donate the emotions they didn't think they had. \n\nAnger,joy, faith, love...\nLooking back on those years filled with tears of both sorrow and joy, I wouldn't trade it for the world. Sure, there were lots of tears and hard times, but they were such high times too, toughing out tough times together. Experiencing human affection outside the boundaries of love, understanding and in some cases inspiring greatness and dedication - this now is what brings me true happiness. \n\nThe feeling of joy that first person brought me was tremendous, but a thousandfold more wonderful was bestowed when I was finally able to offer back what was given - the unstoppable force of real emotion.", "\n\nThe first time I felt happiness was strange - it was such an unfamiliar sensation for me. Although it had been missing from my life so long, that this soft fuzzy feeling of joy found its way to me as soon from the donation box. The moment it did swirl in ionto my being I distinctly remember feeling as if anything was possible and that I wanted to keep it forever.\n\nThoughts of passion and pleasure flooded into my core and a newfound spirit and motivation for life bubble up inside of me. A mix of childhood memories, racing ambitions, past longings that combined together made me who I am today. I encourage anyone who has gone through struggles emotionally, mentally or physically-very often all three, to know that if someone else can canse the magic of finding your true self, than so can you. Share the part of your heart you have saved, and invite the magic of rediscovery into your life too.", "\n\nAt first, the happiness feels foreign and alien, like emotions that had never before been experiences. As the feelings continue, I start to catch onto its little nuances: a warmth that lives in my chest and the effervescent sparkling when I think of a new possibility or something romantic. I recognize joy radiating in the little moments of connection with my family, friends and strangers. I discover joy in peaceful moments of solitude as I give rise to precious moments of stillness wherein unbridled creativity is born.\n\nOver time the borrowed happiness suffuses. Everywhere I look is painfully achingly beautiful. Joy infuses life with love and believing that stunning, extraordinary purpose lays dormant, fully undiscovered amidst the chaos. As I take the time to tally the recycled emotions, I come to revere what happiness has taught me. Life begins to tastes sweeter and clearer and I press forward in a bid to learn more. When the irreplaceable sense seeps through my veins, the infinite contrast of flickering hues enamors me within tumultuous emotions, perpetually ever evolving; without, there exists the familiar accepting, committed emotional environs in which I safed harboured happiness in its pride of tumultuous gratitude. A gentle embrace forged tightly offering security in the certainty of lingering emotions, a voluntary inhalation of choice filled fragrances lending truth upon trust. One day the exchange is perceived change allowing me to enrich the ones I love like never before unwaveringly perceiving vivid emotional state -- ecstatic affectionate detours into grooves of familiar feelings. I open my heart and pay it dearly. For I recognize the gift from unspoken resolution -- one I would never of my own be able to conceive! With happiness, always I abscond.

Feign tales the untold carried until we met. Our individual abundance shatter the corporeality expanding many lifefces in compactment ---- forever intertwined indefinitely", "\n\nI can relate to the heartbreaking emptiness you felt throughout your life. But when that first nugget of happiness slipped through the slot in your emtpy donation box, it was as though I was brought into feeling nothing but joy. I watched closely as a spark of emotion flew through the air, filling up the emptiness of the room until an indescribable warmth took over. I no longer felt my emotional void, but instead was feeling a new impulse coursing through my veins. This happiness that had so distracted replaced many sadness, feards, and regrets with hope for a future of more than empty. These feelings were humbling and freshly exciting at the same time. \n\nThis gratitude did more than give warmth to myself alone- it extended to the many emotions found in us all. It taught me a humbling realization that our decisions create our joy. Unwanted emotions still come and go, but replacing these emotions with acceptance can help protect and cherish these feelings while turning them into beauty. In exchange, the impact left something deep and tangible in my heart. This wondrous act of kind generosity had reshaped my view of the world; that even in involuntary situations, we can come through full circle to better understand ourselves and the life around us.", "\n\nThe city was a strange sight for an outsider. Even though from the outside it looked like any normal city, something was profoundly different. Every single person had a special ability. Flying, telekinesis, the knowing; the list was almost endless. Every one of these people had been tested and ranked according to their power level. Rules were strictly enforced about nobility, and what could and could not be done with one's talent.\n\nBut I was something of a strange case. For a while, nobody knew what spectrum of power I had. Tenants of the town called me \"The Untouchable,\" and gossiped behind my back about whether I had some kind of ultimate, God-like power, or just nothing at all. Make believe got passed around as well, including a popular rumour that I could look upon somebody and strip them of their power altogether. No concrete evidence of such had ever been seen.\n\nNeedless to say, merchants weren't prepared to extend popular courtesy to me, or any other citizen of peculiar behavioural qualities. I stayed away from the public gatherings and product pedestals, receiving hardly a dollop of conversation from local citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, comments such as I was number one in the rankings; irreplaceable to anyone foolishly overstepping its boundaries, whicker for about despite such fansty ramblings, establishing an invisible quality of being unaccountable above everyone else.\n\nNo one tampered with me and no one wasted their precious energy hoping to pry off such a daunting registration against my personal ability bankrolled by the numerous preeminent gems I had attainaed over my thirteen years in the City.\n\nUntil one day, the then second-in-command, bearing a startling accomplishment of her intense coup she designated from with two baleful others in pursuit, was coaxing me to slipwpage uptight discretion.\n\nLaying down a biblically proportioned irate challenge, the familiar trio prirogue impatiently overlooking the display and battle courts\"That gap will close and soon, and if others succeed sooner than you know it, Your zero-water eminence will cease\u201d.\n\nBy existing precedent, any obstacles posed were impossible.

He had been staying away most nights recently; bartering and haggling away his goods on the black market. What no one knew was that Trent gained access to these unsavory concourses as a part of his carefully kept secret.\n\nTrent masked his power from the eyes of others as he moved quietly within tightly wired alleys and sheets of electricity pulsating around him. As he moved, he fed the flow of power hemming him in, gaining a greater surround message, a sensation of a calm serenity. Flooded in chaste peace, he ducked beneath the quick shower of dynamism chasing him every night in pursuit of power and recognition.\n\nTrent slumber counted the hours steadily every night while all of the storytellers, rank holders and market goers wover together hastily about his humble figure between arc webs spanning wide.

Our city had always been the same, filled with different kinds of people, until one day mysterious powers began emanating from one individual, a woman later discovered to be called Baerliss. She was quite revolutionary - gifted with telekinesis unlike any our city had seen before, she raised the bar on the ability of using power among the citizens of the city. But change was bound to follow; Five days after the event of Baerliss, the city drastically changed. It had created an individual power ranking system for every resident based on their power, shape, strength and capability. Nobody resisted the change for they fear repercussions, because with proof of their powers, what was not agreeable could mean death sentence.\n\nAll seemed okay, until I realized my standing in the rank. To my immense disbelief, I, Lisa Grove, was appointed the first overall rank in the Power Ranking System of my city! I knew it was definitely suspicious that my name never reviled its secrets, this was astonishing - why can't anyone discover what my exploits were?\n\nMonths slid past, and I was pushed hard to tap into whatever secret strength I possessed. All that might, kept in deep seclusion with only myself to rely on. Yet, I could still remember the day that Baerliss descended upon the people to disturb common order. Rumblings of an impending monopoly on power beamed across the City. Oh, she promised deceit so fair of sharing her blessings to times past; but was it for the pride of a grand power or another fever you cannot quite make out? But meanwhile, many had learned the warmth off maiming and killing powerful figure active as part of the community, yet soaring stronger high apart in the power hierarchy.\n\nNow almost everyone in the higher level had lay a plan either intimidate or getting an assassination done to wipe up the standing.

I can manipulate electricity, move things with my mind, control the elements, and detect danger. I'm supposed to be the most powerful person in the city, though nobody knows what my power is.\n\nFor as long as anybody can remember, the citizens of this city have fought constantly over personal rankings and superior rights. Each person is expected to declare one specific power, and the amount of power decides their rank - the stronger the psychic energy behind the power, the higher the rank.\n\nDiscontent eventually overtook the afterthought of peaceful negotiation and a power struggle ensued between all the members of the city. You know the score - rage on each other's powers, debate endlessly who deserved the rank of 1, and resort to making decisions with thoughts of self-preservation at the forefront.\n\nIt wasn't until somebody actually managed to kill another citizen, stealing their decree of rank from the dead criminal's eyes and mouth, that the paranoia and chaos was brought to an abrupt halt. It became painfully familiar with everyone - in less than a flick of one's wrists, any citizen could be ranked number 1.\n\nMyself included.\n\nI hid my true identity and kept my power as something quite blissfully transcendental - not something easily force-effective or measured in pure numbers of begrudging streams.
