["I won last year's time travel competition by killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before. I traveled back to the early 1930s, when Hitler was just starting to gain power in Germany. I infiltrated his inner circle and gained his trust. Once I had his trust, I slowly poisoned him with a slow-acting toxin that would take weeks to kill him. I made sure to keep my identity a secret, so that no one would suspect me of the deed. The toxin worked slowly, and Hitler's health deteriorated over the course of several weeks. Eventually, he died in his sleep, and the world was saved from his tyranny. I won the competition because of my creativity and the difficulty of my plan. It was a risky move, but it paid off in the end.", "I won the championship last year by going back to April 30, 1945, the day of Adolf Hitler's suicide. I had to be creative and think outside the box to come up with a plan that would earn me the most points. My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to April 30, 1945, and then use a special device to create a time loop. This time loop would cause Hitler to relive the same day over and over again, until he eventually went insane. I then used a special device to create a force field around Hitler, so that he could not escape the time loop. I then waited until he had gone completely insane, and then I used a special device to transport him to a different time and place. Once I had transported him to a different time and place, I was able to earn the most points by ensuring that Hitler would never be able to return to April 30, 1945. This ensured that he would never be able to commit suicide, and thus I was able to win the championship.", "I won last year's championship by traveling back to April 30, 1945, the day of Adolf Hitler's suicide.

I then proceeded to disable all of the weapons in the bunker, making it impossible for Hitler to take his own life. The next morning, I waited outside the bunker and watched as Hitler emerged, confused and angry. I then proceeded to taunt him, telling him that he was powerless and that he would never be able to take his own life. Hitler, enraged, charged at me, but I was prepared. I had brought a tranquilizer gun with me and was able to subdue him before he could do any harm. I then took him to a secure location and handed him over to the authorities.

I infiltrated a small Nazi rally and, using a combination of my knowledge of the future and my acting skills, I convinced the crowd that I was a powerful figure in the Nazi party. I then proceeded to give a rousing speech, praising Hitler and his ideas. I made sure to emphasize the importance of loyalty to the Nazi cause and the need to follow Hitler's orders without question. At the end of my speech, I presented Hitler with a gift - a small box containing a vial of poison. I told him that it was a symbol of my loyalty and that he should drink it as a sign of his commitment to the Nazi cause.
