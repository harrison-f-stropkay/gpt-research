She said she loved him only.

The words echoed in his head as he watched her walk away. He had never seen her look so beautiful, so determined. She was leaving him, and there was nothing he could do to stop her.

They had been together for years, and he had thought they were happy. But then, a few months ago, she had started to change. She became distant and withdrawn, and she would often disappear for hours at a time. When he asked her what was wrong, she would just say that she needed some time to herself.

He had tried to be patient, but it was getting harder and harder. He loved her more than anything in the world, and he didn't want to lose her. But he knew that he couldn't force her to stay.

He watched her until she was out of sight, and then he turned and walked back to his car. He got in and drove away, but he didn't know where he was going. He just needed to get away, to clear his head.

He drove for hours, until he found himself in a small town. He pulled into a parking lot and got out of the car. He walked around for a while, just taking in the sights and sounds of the town. It was a quiet, peaceful place, and he felt himself start to relax.

He came across a park and sat down on a bench. He watched the children playing, and he smiled. He remembered when he was a child, and how much he loved playing in the park.

He closed his eyes and thought about her. He remembered the first time he saw her, and how he knew instantly that she was the one for him. He remembered all the good times they had shared, and he felt a wave of sadness wash over him.

He opened his eyes and looked up at the sky. He took a deep breath and said a silent prayer. He prayed that she would be happy, wherever she was.

He stood up and started to walk back to his car. He knew that he would never forget her, and he would always love her. But he also knew that he had to let her go.

She said she loved him only.

"I love you too," she said. "But I can't do this anymore. I need to be with someone who will put me first."

He had fallen in love with her quickly. He had never felt this way about anyone before. He knew that she was the one for him.

But now, he wasn't so sure. He had never seen her so angry before. He didn't know what he had done wrong. He had only been trying to help.

He had tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't listen. She just kept walking away.

He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to lose her. He loved her only.

He stood there for a long time, watching her walk away. He didn't know what he was going to do. He didn't know how he was going to win her back.

But he knew that he had to try. He loved her only.

He took a deep breath and started to walk after her. He didn't know what he was going to say, but he knew that he had to say something.

He caught up to her and stopped her. She turned to look at him, her eyes still filled with anger.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to make you angry. I was only trying to help."

She didn't say anything. She just stared at him.

"I love you," he said. "Only you."

Her eyes softened a little. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly.

"I love you too," she said.

He didn't know what to say. He had never felt this way about anyone before. He had never loved anyone before. And now, this woman, this stranger, this beautiful, mysterious woman, told him that she loved him.

Only.

He didn't know what that meant. Did it mean that she loved him more than anyone else? Or did it mean that she loved him only because she had no one else to love?

He didn't want to ask her. He didn't want to know the answer. He was afraid that if he knew the answer, it would ruin everything.

So he said nothing. He just looked at her, and she looked back at him. And in that moment, they were both lost in each other's eyes.

They stood there for a long time, just looking at each other. And then, slowly, she reached out and took his hand. He didn't resist. He just let her lead him away.

They walked for a long time, hand in hand. They didn't say anything. They didn't need to. They were content just to be together.

Finally, they came to a clearing in the woods. The sun was setting, and the sky was ablaze with color. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.

She stopped and turned to him. "This is where I live," she said.

He looked around. It was a small cabin, nestled in the woods. It was perfect.

"It's beautiful," he said.

She smiled. "I thought you might like it."

They stood there for a moment, looking at each other. And then, he leaned in and kissed her.

It was the most perfect kiss he had ever had.

She said she loved him. Only him. That he was the only man she'd ever loved, not Mr Beddoes, whoever that may be. She said she hated Mr Beddoes but she was lying. She didn't hate Mr Beddoes. She didn't even know him. But she knew that if she didn't say she hated him, then Mr. Major Payne would never let her see him again.

Mr. Major Payne was a big, burly man with a booming voice. He was the head of security at the company where she worked. He was also her father.

She had met Mr. Beddoes at a party a few weeks ago. He was handsome and charming, and she had been immediately attracted to him. They had talked for hours that night, and she had felt a connection with him that she had never felt with anyone else.

When she got home that night, she told her father about Mr. Beddoes. He was furious. He told her that Mr. Beddoes was a bad man, and that she was never to see him again.

She tried to argue with him, but he wouldn't listen. He said that he knew what was best for her, and that she was going to do as he said.

She was angry and frustrated, but she knew that there was no point in arguing with him. She would just have to find a way to see Mr. Beddoes without him knowing.

The next day, she went to the library and checked out a book on locksmithing. She spent the next few days practicing on the locks in her house. When she was finally confident that she could pick a lock, she went to Mr. Beddoes' apartment.

She picked the lock on his door and let herself in. He was surprised to see her, but he was also happy. They talked for hours, and she felt closer to him than ever before.

She knew that she was doing something wrong, but she didn't care. She loved Mr. Beddoes, and she was going to see him no matter what her father said.

The next day, she went back to Mr. Beddoes' apartment. She was hoping to spend the night with him, but he told her that he couldn't. He said that he had to go out of town for a few days.

She was disappointed, but she understood. She told him that she would miss him, and he told her that he would miss her too.

She went home feeling sad and lonely. She knew that she would never be able to forget Mr. Beddoes, and she didn't want to. She loved him, only him.

A few days later, she got a call from Mr. Beddoes. He told her that he was back in town, and that he wanted to see her.

She was so happy to hear from him. She agreed to meet him at his apartment that night.

When she got to his apartment, he was waiting for her at the door. He took her in his arms and kissed her. She kissed him back, and she felt like she was in heaven.

They spent the night together, and it was the most amazing night of her life. She knew that she would never forget it.

The next morning, she woke up in Mr. Beddoes' arms. She looked into his eyes and said, "I love you."

He smiled and said, "I love you too."

They kissed again, and then she got up and got dressed. She had to go home, but she didn't want to leave. She wanted to stay with him forever.

She walked to the door, and then she turned and looked at him again. She said, "Only you."

He smiled and said, "I know."

She smiled back, and then she left.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I can't do this."

Her eyes widened in pain. "But why not?" she asked. "We love each other."

"I know," he said. "But it's not enough."

"What do you mean?" she asked. "What else is there?"

"There's our families," he said. "They'll never accept us together."

"I don't care about them," she said. "I only care about you."

"But I care about them," he said. "I can't do this to them."

She looked at him for a long moment, her eyes pleading. But he didn't waver.

"I'm sorry," he said again. "I can't do this."

She turned and walked away, her shoulders slumped in defeat. He watched her go, his heart breaking. He knew he had made the right decision, but it didn't make it any easier.

She had been with her lover for two years, and she had thought they were happy. But now she wasn't so sure. She had always known that he was attracted to other women, but she had never thought he would act on it.

She didn't know what to do. She loved her lover, but she didn't want to share him. She wanted him to love her only.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to make you feel that way."

"It's not just that," she said. "I've been feeling like you're not as interested in me as you used to be."

"That's not true," he said. "I love you more than anything."

"Then why are you looking at other women?" she asked.

Her husband saw her looking and frowned. "What's wrong?" he asked.

"Nothing," she said quickly. "I was just thinking about something."

He didn't look convinced, but he didn't press the issue. Instead, he turned to the other man and introduced himself.

"I'm John," he said. "And this is my wife, Mary."

"It's nice to meet you," the other man said. "I'm David."

They talked for a while, and Mary found herself drawn to David. He was funny and charming, and he made her feel things she hadn't felt in a long time. She knew she shouldn't, but she couldn't help herself.

Later that night, as she lay in bed next to her husband, she couldn't stop thinking about David. She knew she was wrong, but she wanted him. She wanted to feel his lips on hers, his hands on her body.

She closed her eyes and imagined what it would be like to be with him. She could almost feel his touch, his kiss. She moaned softly and turned over, trying to get comfortable. But it was no use. She couldn't sleep. All she could think about was David.

The next day, she couldn't stop thinking about David. She knew she had to see him again. She had to find out if he felt the same way about her.

She waited until her husband was at work, and then she called David. He answered on the first ring.

"Hi," she said. "It's Mary."

"Hi, Mary," he said. "It's good to hear from you."

"I was wondering if you'd like to go out for dinner sometime," she said.

She loved the way he made her laugh. She loved the way he always knew how to make her feel better when she was down. She loved the way he looked at her, like she was the only person in the world.

But most of all, she loved the way he made her feel safe. She felt like she could be herself around him, and that he would never judge her. She felt like she could tell him anything, and that he would always be there for her.

She knew that he loved her too. She could see it in his eyes, and she could feel it in his touch. But she also knew that he was scared. He was scared of getting hurt, and he was scared of losing her.

But she knew that she would never hurt him. She loved him too much. And she knew that he would never lose her. She would always be there for him, no matter what.

So she said it again, "I love you only." And this time, she meant it more than ever.

She said it with such conviction, such passion, that he couldn't help but believe her. He had never seen her look at anyone else the way she looked at him. Her eyes were full of love and adoration, and he felt like he was the luckiest man in the world.

They had been together for a few years now, and their love for each other had only grown stronger with time. They were best friends, lovers, and soulmates. They knew each other inside and out, and they accepted each other for who they were.

He knew that she would always be there for him, no matter what. She was his rock, his safe haven, his everything. He couldn't imagine his life without her.

She said she loved him only.

And he knew that she meant it.

She smiled, relief flooding through her. She had been waiting for him to say those words for so long.

They kissed, and for a moment, everything was perfect. But then, the moment passed, and reality came crashing back in.

They were from different worlds. He was rich and powerful, and she was poor and struggling. They could never be together.

She knew that, but she couldn't help but dream. She dreamed of a world where they could be together, where their love was enough.

But that world didn't exist. And so, she would have to content herself with the love they shared, even if it was only for a moment.

She said she loved him only. And that was enough.

"She said she loved him only."

The words echoed in his head as he stood there, watching her walk away. He had never seen her so angry, and he didn't know what he had done to deserve this. He had always been faithful to her, and he had always put her first. But now, she was gone, and he didn't know how to get her back.

He had met her in college, and they had been inseparable ever since. They had gone through so much together, and he had always thought that they would be together forever. But now, he wasn't so sure.

He knew that he had made mistakes, but he didn't think that they were worth breaking up over. He had always been there for her, and he had always loved her. But now, it seemed like that wasn't enough.

He watched her get into her car and drive away, and he knew that he had to do something. He couldn't let her go like this. He had to find a way to make her understand how much he loved her.

He got in his car and followed her. He knew that it was a risky move, but he had to do something. He had to find a way to get her back.

He followed her to her apartment, and he waited outside for her to come out. When she finally did, he walked up to her and said, "I'm sorry."

She looked at him with cold eyes. "For what?" she asked.

"For everything," he said. "I know I've made mistakes, but I love you. I only love you."

She looked at him for a long moment, and then she said, "I need some time."

And with that, she turned and walked away.

He watched her go, and he knew that he had to give her the time she needed. But he also knew that he would never give up on her. He would never stop loving her.

He would wait for her, no matter how long it took.

"She said she loved him only."

Those were the last words that she ever said to him. They were sitting on a bench in the park, watching the sunset. She had been crying, and he had been trying to comfort her. But nothing he said seemed to be able to make her feel better.

Finally, she looked up at him and said, "I love you. Only you."

He didn't know what to say. He had never seen her like this before. She was usually so strong and independent. But now she was vulnerable and scared.

He reached out and took her hand. "I love you too," he said. "More than anything."

She smiled weakly and leaned her head on his shoulder. They sat there in silence for a long time, just enjoying each other's company.

As the sun began to set, she turned to him and said, "I have to go."

He nodded. "I'll walk you home."

They walked home in silence. When they got to her door, she turned to him and said, "Thank you for everything."

He smiled. "You're welcome."

She leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips. Then she turned and went inside.

He stood there for a long time, watching her door. He couldn't believe that she was gone. But he knew that she would be back.

She said she loved him only. And he knew that he loved her too. More than anything.

He reached out and took her hand. "I love you too," he said. "But I can't give you what you want."

She nodded, her eyes filling with tears. "I know," she said. "I just wanted you to know."

He pulled her close and hugged her tightly. "I'm going to miss you," he said.

She hugged him back. "I'm going to miss you too," she said.

They pulled away and looked at each other one last time. Then she turned and walked away.

He watched her go, his heart breaking. He knew he would never see her again.

But he would never forget her. She was the only one who had ever truly loved him.

"She said she loved him only."

The words echoed in his mind as he walked away from her. He had never heard her say those words before, and he had never felt so loved. But he also knew that she was lying.

He had seen her with other men. He had seen the way she looked at them, the way she touched them. She didn't love him only. She loved them all.

But he didn't care. He loved her, and that was all that mattered.

He would never forget the way she looked at him when she said those words. He would never forget the way she made him feel.

He would never forget her.

He would always love her.

Even if she didn't love him back.

"She said she loved him only."

The words echoed in his head as he walked away from her. He had never heard her say those words before, and they had filled him with hope. But now, as he walked away, he wasn't sure what to think.

He had always known that she loved him, but he had never been sure if she loved him only. There had always been other men in her life, and he had always been afraid that she would choose one of them over him.

But now, she had said those words. She had said that she loved him only. And he had believed her.

He walked for hours, trying to make sense of what had happened. He couldn't believe that she had finally said those words to him. He had always wanted to hear them, but now that he had heard them, he didn't know what to do with them.

He finally made his way back to his apartment, and he collapsed on the bed. He closed his eyes and thought about her. He thought about her smile, her laugh, and her eyes. He thought about all the things he loved about her.

And then he thought about the other men in her life. He thought about the men who had come before him, and the men who would come after him. And he realized that he would never be able to compete with them.

He was just a regular guy. He had a regular job, a regular car, and a regular life. He wasn't rich or famous or powerful. He was just a guy who loved her.

And that wasn't enough.

He knew that she would never be happy with him. She deserved someone better. Someone who could give her the world. Someone who could make her happy.

And he wasn't that person.

So he got up and walked out of the apartment. He didn't know where he was going, but he knew that he couldn't stay there anymore. He couldn't stay there and watch her love someone else.

He walked for hours, until he found himself in a park. He sat down on a bench and looked up at the sky. He thought about her, and he wondered if she would ever think about him again.

And then he heard the words again.

"She said she loved him only."

He smiled. He knew that she would never forget him. And he knew that he would never forget her.

She would always be the one who got away.

"She said she loved him only."

Those were the last words she said to him before she died. He had been in a car accident, and she had been driving. She had survived with only minor injuries, but he had been killed instantly.

He had always known that she loved him, but it was different hearing her say it. It was like she was saying it for the first time, and it made him realize how much he loved her too.

He didn't know how he was going to go on without her. She was his best friend, his lover, and his soulmate. He didn't know how he was going to face the world without her by his side.

But he knew that he had to try. He had to find a way to go on, for her sake. She wouldn't want him to be sad. She would want him to be happy.

So he would try. He would try to be happy. He would try to live his life without her.

But it wouldn't be easy. He knew that. He would miss her every day. But he would also remember her love. And that would give him the strength to go on.

"She said she loved him only."

Those were the last words she said to him. And they would be the last words he would ever forget.

He had been married before, and his wife had died in a car accident. He had never been able to fully let go of her, and he knew that he would never be able to give his heart to someone else.

He took a deep breath and said, "I'm sorry. I can't do this."

She looked at him with tears in her eyes. "But why not?" she asked. "I love you."

"I know," he said. "But I can't give you what you want. I'm not ready."

She nodded and turned away. He watched her walk away, and he felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He knew that he had hurt her, and he wished that he could take it back.

But he couldn't. He had to be honest with her, even if it meant hurting her.

He watched her go, and he knew that he would never see her again. But he also knew that he would never forget her. She was the one who had taught him the meaning of love, and he would always be grateful for that.

He turned and walked away, and he knew that he would never be the same.

She said she loved him only, but her eyes betrayed her. They lingered on the other man, the one who had just walked into the room. He was tall and handsome, with dark hair and blue eyes. She couldn't help but notice him, and she knew he had noticed her too.

Her husband saw the look in her eyes, and he knew what she was thinking. He felt a pang of jealousy, but he knew he couldn't blame her. He was not the most handsome man in the world, and he knew he could never compete with the other man.

But he also knew that she loved him. She had told him so many times, and he believed her. He knew that she would never cheat on him, and he trusted her completely.

So he let her look, and he let her dream. He knew that she would always come back to him, and that was all that mattered.

She said she loved him only, and he believed her.
