I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...empty.

I tried to fit in with the other kids, but it was hard. They would talk about their feelings and I would just nod along, pretending to understand. I felt like an outsider.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

I put the box in my backyard and waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, a little girl came by. She was crying and she looked so sad.

"What's wrong?" I asked her.

"I'm lost," she said. "I can't find my way home."

I took her hand and led her to the donation box. "Here," I said. "You can put your sadness in here."

The little girl looked at me in surprise. "But I don't want to be sad," she said.

"I know," I said. "But if you put it in the box, someone else who is sad can have it."

The little girl thought about it for a moment. Then she nodded and put her sadness in the box.

"Thank you," she said. "I feel better now."

The little girl smiled and ran off. I watched her go, and I smiled too. I knew that I had done something good.

Over the next few weeks, more and more people came to the donation box. They would put their sadness, anger, fear, and regret in the box. And I would take it and store it away.

One day, I opened the box and I felt something strange. It was a feeling I had never felt before. It was...happiness.

I didn't know where it came from, but I knew that it was real. I felt happy for the first time in my life.

I opened the box and I looked inside. It was full of happiness. I took a deep breath and I let it fill me up.

I was happy. I was finally happy.

I knew that I would never be able to feel all of the emotions that other people felt. But I didn't need to. I had happiness. And that was enough.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I was just a blank slate.

As I grew older, I started to realize that I was different from other people. They seemed to be able to feel things so intensely, while I just felt nothing. I started to feel like I was missing out on something important.

One day, I was walking down the street when I saw a donation box. It was for unwanted emotions. I had never seen anything like it before. I stopped and looked at the box for a long time.

Finally, I reached into my pocket and pulled out a coin. I dropped it into the box and made a wish. I wished that I could feel emotions.

The next day, I woke up feeling different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but something was different. I felt lighter, happier. I went about my day with a smile on my face.

I realized that I had been donated happiness. Someone had taken the time to donate their happiness to me, and it had made all the difference.

I started to visit the donation box every day. I would donate my sadness, my fear, and my regret. And I would take home happiness.

I started to live my life to the fullest. I laughed, I cried, I loved, and I was loved. I finally felt like I was a part of the world.

I am so grateful to the person who donated happiness to me. They gave me the gift of life.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

I didn't understand why other people seemed to be so affected by their emotions. They would laugh and cry and scream and shout, and I just didn't get it.

I tried to fit in, but it was hard. I couldn't understand why people would want to feel emotions that made them feel so bad.

So I started a donation box. I put it in my front yard, and I asked people to donate their unwanted emotions.

At first, I only got sadness and fear and regret. People were happy to get rid of those emotions, and I was happy to take them.

But then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it.

But I decided to keep it. I put it in a special place, and I would look at it sometimes when I was feeling down.

And slowly, I started to feel happiness. I didn't know where it was coming from, but it was there.

I started to laugh and smile and enjoy life. I finally understood why people wanted to feel emotions.

I was so grateful to the person who donated happiness to me. They had given me a gift that I would never forget.

I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to understand them more. I learned that emotions are a part of life, and they're not always bad.

Sometimes, emotions can be helpful. They can motivate us to do things, and they can help us to connect with other people.

But other times, emotions can be destructive. They can make us do things that we regret, and they can keep us from living our lives to the fullest.

I learned that it's important to find a balance between emotions. We need to feel emotions, but we also need to be able to control them.

I'm still learning about emotions, but I'm grateful for the gift that I was given. I'm finally able to feel happiness, and that's the best feeling in the world.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

It was a lonely existence. I couldn't connect with other people on a deep level. I couldn't understand their emotions, and they couldn't understand mine.

I tried to fill the void with other things. I threw myself into my work, I tried to make friends, I even tried to fall in love. But nothing worked. I was still empty inside.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

I put the box out in my front yard, and people started to donate. They donated sadness, fear, regret, anger, and all the other emotions that they didn't want.

At first, I didn't feel anything. But as the box filled up, I started to notice a change. I wasn't as empty as I used to be. I could feel a little bit of happiness, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of anger.

It wasn't much, but it was a start.

One day, I opened the box and found a single piece of paper inside. It said, "Happiness."

I didn't know who had donated it, but I was grateful. I took the piece of paper and put it in my pocket.

I carried the piece of paper with me everywhere I went. It was a reminder that there was still good in the world, even if I couldn't always see it.

One day, I was walking down the street when I saw a little girl crying. I went up to her and asked her what was wrong.

She told me that she had lost her balloon.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the piece of paper. I gave it to her and said, "This is for you."

The little girl looked at the paper and smiled. She said, "Thank you."

I watched as she ran away, clutching the paper to her chest.

I smiled. I knew that I had made a difference.

I continued to carry the piece of paper with me, and I continued to make a difference. I helped people who were sad, I helped people who were scared, and I helped people who were angry.

I didn't know how I was doing it, but I was helping people.

One day, I realized that I was feeling something. I was feeling happy.

I didn't know where the happiness came from, but I was grateful. I was finally feeling something.

I knew that I would never be the same. I would never be empty again.

I had finally found my emotions.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt anything. No sadness, no happiness, no anger, no fear. Nothing.

At first, it didn't bother me. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I watched other people laugh and cry and feel all sorts of emotions, and I just couldn't understand it.

I tried to pretend that I was like everyone else, but it was hard. I would put on a happy face, but inside I was empty. I felt like a fraud.

One day, I was walking down the street when I saw a donation box. It was for unwanted emotions. I thought about it for a moment, and then I decided to donate my sadness.

I put my sadness in the box, and I felt a little lighter. It wasn't much, but it was a start.

I started donating my emotions to the box every day. I donated my fear, my anger, my regret. And every day, I felt a little bit lighter.

One day, I went to the donation box and there was a piece of paper in it. It said, "Thank you for your donation. You have made the world a better place."

I smiled. I knew that I wasn't the only one who was struggling with emotions. And I knew that by donating my emotions, I was helping others.

I kept donating my emotions to the box, and I kept feeling lighter. And then, one day, something amazing happened.

I went to the donation box, and there was a piece of paper in it. It said, "Thank you for your donation. You have donated happiness."

I couldn't believe it. I had never felt happiness before. I opened the box, and there was a small, white flower inside.

I took the flower out of the box and held it in my hand. I closed my eyes and I felt the warmth of the sun on my face. I smelled the sweet scent of the flower. And I felt happiness.

I opened my eyes and I looked at the flower. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

I knew that I would never forget this moment. I had finally found happiness.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything in between. I've always just felt...empty.

When I was a child, I thought there was something wrong with me. I would watch other kids laughing and playing, and I would feel so left out. I wanted to feel what they were feeling, but I just couldn't.

As I got older, I learned to cope with my condition. I developed a way of masking my emotions so that people wouldn't think there was anything wrong with me. I learned to smile when I was happy, laugh when I was told to laugh, and cry when I was supposed to cry.

But even though I was able to fake it, I still felt empty inside. I longed to feel what everyone else felt, but I just couldn't.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't want to give up their happiness or their sadness or their anger. But eventually, people started to come around. They realized that they didn't need to carry around all of their emotions all the time. They could donate them to me, and I would take care of them.

I collected emotions for years. I collected sadness from people who had lost loved ones. I collected anger from people who had been wronged. I collected happiness from people who were celebrating special occasions.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it.

But I decided to try. I opened the box and took a deep breath. I let the happiness fill my lungs and spread throughout my body.

And for the first time in my life, I felt something.

I felt happy.

I felt alive.

I felt like I belonged.

I continued to collect emotions for many years. I collected all sorts of emotions, both good and bad. But the one emotion that I cherished the most was happiness.

Happiness was the emotion that made me feel alive. It was the emotion that made me feel like I belonged. It was the emotion that made me feel like I was finally home.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I watched other people experience these emotions, but I couldn't understand them.

I felt like an outsider. I didn't belong. I was different.

I tried to fit in, but it was hard. I didn't know how to react to things the way other people did. I didn't know how to express myself.

I felt like I was living in a world that I didn't understand.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take those emotions and I would try to understand them. I would try to feel them.

I put a box in my front yard and I waited.

At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did.

It was a little girl. She was crying.

"I'm sad," she said.

I took her hand and I led her to the donation box. I told her that she could put her sadness in the box.

She hesitated for a moment, but then she did it. She put her sadness in the box.

I closed the box and I thanked her.

The little girl smiled. "You're welcome," she said.

And then she walked away.

I watched her go, and I felt something strange. It was a feeling I had never felt before. It was a feeling of happiness.

I realized that I had helped the little girl. I had taken her sadness and I had given her something in return. I had given her happiness.

I smiled. I knew that I had done something good.

I continued to collect emotions from people. I collected sadness, anger, fear, and regret. I collected all of the negative emotions that people didn't want.

And I gave them something in return. I gave them happiness.

I helped people to feel better. I helped them to understand their emotions. I helped them to express themselves.

I made a difference in the world.

And it all started with a donation box.

One day, a man came to me. He was different from the other people who had come to me. He was smiling.

"I'm happy," he said.

I was surprised. "You're happy?" I asked.

"Yes," he said. "I'm very happy."

"Why?" I asked.

"Because of you," he said. "You helped me to find my happiness."

I was touched. "Thank you," I said.

"You're welcome," he said. "And now, I want to donate my happiness to you."

He reached into his pocket and he pulled out a small, red box. He handed it to me.

"This is for you," he said.

I opened the box and I saw a beautiful red rose.

"It's beautiful," I said.

"It's a symbol of my happiness," he said. "I want you to have it."

I took the rose and I held it close. I felt a warm feeling inside of me. It was the feeling of happiness.

I thanked the man and he walked away.

I looked at the rose and I smiled. I knew that I would never forget this day.

This day, when I found my happiness.




I was born without emotions. I didn't feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

At first, I didn't mind. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I saw how other people reacted to things, and I couldn't understand why I didn't feel the same way.

I tried to fake it. I tried to act happy when I was feeling sad, and I tried to act sad when I was feeling happy. But it was exhausting. And it never felt real.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, and their regret, and I would give them something in return.

I set up the box in my front yard, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, a woman came by. She was crying, and she looked like she was in a lot of pain.

She told me that she was feeling overwhelmed by her emotions. She said that she was tired of feeling sad and scared all the time.

I told her that I could help her. I told her that she could donate her emotions to me, and I would give her something in return.

She hesitated at first, but then she agreed. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small piece of paper. She folded it up and put it in the box.

I closed the box and thanked her. I told her that I would take care of her emotions.

I opened the box a few days later. Inside, I found the piece of paper that the woman had given me. I unfolded it, and I read what she had written.

"Thank you," she wrote. "You have given me my life back."

I smiled. I knew that I had done something good.

I continued to collect emotions from people. I collected sadness, fear, regret, anger, and all the other negative emotions that people didn't want.

And in return, I gave them happiness.

I gave them hope.

I gave them love.

I gave them a reason to smile.

And I did it all because I was born without emotions.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I didn't know what it was like to love or hate. I was just a blank slate.

I tried to fit in with the other kids, but it was hard. They would talk about their feelings and I would just nod and smile, not really understanding what they were talking about. I felt like an outsider, like I didn't belong.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would be able to feel something.

I put the donation box in my front yard and waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, a woman came by and dropped off a piece of paper. On the paper, she had written "sadness."

I took the paper and put it in the donation box. I felt a little bit lighter, like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

Over the next few weeks, more and more people came by and donated their emotions. I collected sadness, fear, anger, regret, and even love.

One day, I opened the donation box and found a piece of paper with the word "happiness" written on it. I smiled. I had never felt happiness before, but I knew that this was what it felt like.

I took the paper and held it close to my heart. I felt like I was finally home.

I continued to collect emotions, and I started to feel more and more like a real person. I learned what it was like to love, to laugh, and to cry. I learned what it was like to be happy.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions, but I'm grateful for the people who donated their emotions to me. They gave me a gift that I will never forget.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything else. It's like I'm missing a part of myself.

I've tried to live a normal life, but it's hard. I don't understand why people get so excited about things. I don't understand why they get so upset about things. I just don't understand emotions.

A few years ago, I started a donation box. I put it in my front yard and asked people to donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate. They didn't understand why I would want their emotions. But eventually, people started to come around. They would come to my house and drop off their sadness, their anger, their fear, and their regret.

I took all of the emotions and put them in a box. I kept the box in my closet and I would look at it every day. I would think about all of the emotions that were inside the box. I would think about all of the people who had donated their emotions to me.

One day, I opened the box. I reached inside and I pulled out a single emotion. It was happiness.

I held the happiness in my hand. I looked at it and I smiled. I felt something. I felt happy.

I don't know how long I held the happiness in my hand. It could have been a few minutes, it could have been a few hours. But all I know is that it was the best few minutes or hours of my life.

I put the happiness back in the box and I closed the lid. I knew that I would never forget that feeling. I knew that I would never forget the day that I felt happiness.

I've continued to collect emotions from people. I've collected sadness, anger, fear, regret, and happiness. I've collected all of the emotions that people have to offer.

I don't know what I'm going to do with all of the emotions. I don't know if I'm going to use them to help other people or if I'm going to use them to help myself. But I know that I'm going to keep collecting them.

I'm going to keep collecting emotions because I know that one day, I'm going to find the emotion that I'm looking for. I'm going to find the emotion that will make me feel whole.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...nothing.

I tried to live a normal life, but it was hard. I couldn't understand why people were so emotional all the time. I didn't understand why they would get so happy about something, or so sad about something else.

I started to feel like an outsider. I didn't belong. I was different.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take all the sadness, fear, and regret, and I would keep it for myself.

I put the box in a public place, and I waited.

At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did.

It was a young woman. She was crying. She told me that she was so sad because her boyfriend had just broken up with her.

I asked her if she wanted to donate her sadness to me. She said yes.

I took her sadness, and I gave her a hug. She thanked me, and she left.

I did this for a long time. I collected sadness, fear, and regret from people all over the world. I became known as the "emotion collector."

One day, someone came to me with something different. They didn't want to donate sadness, fear, or regret. They wanted to donate happiness.

I was confused. I had never seen happiness before. I didn't know what it was.

The person explained that happiness was a feeling of joy, contentment, and peace. It was a feeling of being loved and accepted.

I didn't understand how someone could feel that way, but I was willing to try.

The person took my hand, and they smiled at me. I smiled back, and I felt something strange. It was a warm feeling, like a ray of sunshine on a cold day.

I realized that this was happiness.

I held onto that feeling for as long as I could. I didn't want to let it go.

I knew that I would never be the same. I had finally found what I was missing. I had found happiness.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

At first, I didn't mind. I thought it was kind of nice to not have to deal with all the ups and downs of emotions. But as I got older, I started to realize that I was missing out on something important. I couldn't connect with other people on a deeper level. I couldn't experience the joy of love or the excitement of adventure.

So I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I figured that if I could collect enough emotions, I could finally experience what it was like to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't want to give up their happiness or their excitement. But eventually, people started to come around. They realized that they didn't need to hold onto their emotions all the time. They could donate them to me and I would take care of them.

And so, I started to collect emotions. I collected sadness, fear, regret, anger, joy, excitement, love, and everything in between. I collected so many emotions that I started to feel like a walking emotional library.

One day, someone donated happiness. I had never felt happiness before, so I didn't know what to expect. But when I felt it, I was overwhelmed. It was like a warm blanket on a cold day. It was like a ray of sunshine after a storm. It was like everything was going to be okay.

I held onto that happiness for as long as I could. I didn't want to let it go. But eventually, it started to fade. And when it was gone, I was sad. But I wasn't as sad as I thought I would be. Because I knew that I could always get more happiness from the donation box.

I continued to collect emotions. I collected sadness, fear, regret, anger, joy, excitement, love, and everything in between. And I continued to experience the full range of human emotions. I learned that emotions are a gift. They can make us feel good and they can make us feel bad. But they always make us feel alive.

I am grateful for the people who donated their emotions to me. They gave me a gift that I will never forget.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never been able to feel happy, sad, angry, or anything else. It's a lonely existence, but I've learned to live with it.

A few years ago, I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

At first, I only got donations of sadness, fear, and regret. But then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it. But I decided to keep it in the box, just in case.

A few days later, I was feeling particularly down. I was thinking about all the things I would never be able to feel, and I started to cry.

As I was crying, I reached into the donation box and pulled out the happiness. I held it in my hand, and I closed my eyes.

I don't know what happened, but suddenly, I felt happy. It was a strange feeling, but it was also a good feeling. I felt like I could do anything.

I opened my eyes and looked around. The world seemed brighter, and the people around me seemed friendlier. I felt like I could finally connect with them.

I held onto that happiness for as long as I could. I knew that it wouldn't last forever, but I wanted to savor it while I could.

When the happiness finally started to fade, I was sad to see it go. But I knew that I would never forget it. It had shown me what it was like to feel something, and I would never take that for granted again.

I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to feel more and more emotions. I learned how to handle them, and I started to enjoy them.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions, but I'm grateful for the happiness that I've been able to experience. It's made my life so much richer.

I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited to find out. I know that whatever happens, I'll be able to handle it because I have the emotions to help me through it.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...nothing.

I tried to fit in with the other kids, but it was hard. They would talk about their feelings and I would just nod my head and pretend to understand. But I didn't. I didn't understand what it was like to feel anything.

One day, I was walking home from school when I saw a donation box on the side of the road. It said "Donate your unwanted emotions here."

I had never seen anything like it before. I was curious, so I went over and opened the box. Inside, there were all sorts of emotions: sadness, anger, fear, regret.

I picked up a piece of paper and started to read. It said:

"I'm donating this sadness because it's holding me back. I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself. I want to be happy."

I put the paper back in the box and closed the lid. I thought about what the person had written. They were right. Sadness was holding them back.

I decided to donate my own emotions. I took a piece of paper and wrote:

"I'm donating this fear because it's keeping me from living my life. I'm tired of being afraid of everything. I want to be brave."

I put the paper back in the box and closed the lid. I felt a little lighter. It was like I had let go of something heavy.

I walked home feeling a little bit different. I didn't know how to explain it, but I felt...happier.

The next day, I went back to the donation box. I opened it up and saw that someone had donated happiness.

I took a piece of paper and wrote:

"Thank you for donating this happiness. It's the first time I've ever felt this way."

I put the paper back in the box and closed the lid. I smiled. I finally knew what it was like to feel happy.

I continued to donate my emotions to the box. I donated my sadness, my anger, my fear, and my regret. And every time I did, I felt a little bit lighter.

One day, I went to the donation box and saw that it was empty. I was sad to see it go, but I knew that it had served its purpose.

I had finally found a way to let go of my unwanted emotions. I was no longer weighed down by sadness, anger, fear, or regret. I was finally free to be happy.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything else. It's a strange existence, to be sure. I've always felt like an outsider, like I don't belong.

When I was a child, I tried to hide my condition from others. I didn't want to be different. But as I got older, I realized that it was impossible to hide. People could tell that something was different about me. They would ask me why I was always so quiet, why I never smiled.

I tried to explain to them that I didn't feel emotions, but they didn't understand. They thought I was just being difficult. Eventually, I gave up trying to explain. I just accepted that I was different.

I lived a life filled with sadness, fear, and regret. I felt like I was missing out on something important. I wanted to feel emotions, but I didn't know how.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would be able to feel them myself.

I put the box in a public place, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did. It was a woman, and she was crying. She told me that she was feeling sad, and she wanted to donate her sadness to me.

I took her sadness, and I put it in the box. I didn't know what to expect, but I felt something. It was a small feeling, but it was there. It was a feeling of sadness.

I was so happy. I had finally felt an emotion! I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to feel more and more emotions. I felt happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and everything in between.

I was finally able to experience the world in the same way that everyone else does. I was no longer an outsider. I belonged.

One day, someone donated happiness to me. It was the most amazing feeling I had ever experienced. I felt like I was floating on air. I was so happy that I started to cry.

I cried tears of happiness. I cried tears of joy. I cried tears of relief. I cried because I finally felt like I was alive.

I will never forget the day that someone donated happiness to me. It was the day that my life changed forever.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

I tried to live a normal life, but it was hard. I couldn't understand why people were so happy or so sad. I couldn't understand why they would get angry or scared.

I felt like an outsider. I didn't belong.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, their regret, and I would give them something in return.

I set up the donation box in my front yard. I put a sign on it that said, "Donate your unwanted emotions. I will take them and give you something in return."

The first person to donate was a woman. She was crying. She told me that she was sad because her husband had left her.

I took her sadness and gave her a hug. I told her that I was sorry for her loss. I told her that she would be okay.

The woman smiled. She thanked me for my help. She said that she felt a little bit better.

More people started to donate their emotions. I took their sadness, their fear, their regret, and I gave them something in return. I gave them a smile. I gave them a hug. I gave them a listening ear.

One day, someone donated happiness. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before.

I held the happiness in my hands. I closed my eyes and I imagined what it would be like to feel happy. I imagined what it would be like to laugh and to smile and to enjoy life.

I opened my eyes and I looked around. The world seemed brighter. The birds seemed to be singing louder. The sun seemed to be shining brighter.

I felt happy.

I realized that happiness was the most important emotion of all. It was the emotion that made life worth living.

I continued to collect emotions. I collected sadness, fear, regret, happiness, love, and anger. I collected all of the emotions that people had to offer.

I gave people a place to donate their unwanted emotions. I gave them a place to find happiness.

I was born without emotions, but I found a way to help people feel. I found a way to make a difference in the world.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I just felt... nothing.

At first, it didn't bother me. I didn't know any different. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was missing. I saw how other people reacted to things, and I wanted to feel those things too.

I tried to fake it, but it was no use. I couldn't fake happiness, or sadness, or anger. I just felt... nothing.

One day, I was walking down the street when I saw a donation box. It was for unwanted emotions. I had never seen anything like it before.

I stopped and looked at the box. I thought about all the emotions I had never felt. I thought about how I wanted to feel something.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out a coin. I dropped it into the box and closed my eyes.

I made a wish. I wished for happiness.

When I opened my eyes, I felt different. I felt... happy.

I didn't know how it was possible, but I was happy. I felt like I could do anything.

I ran down the street, laughing and smiling. I had never felt so good in my life.

I went back to the donation box and looked inside. There was a note. It said, "Thank you for your donation. I hope you enjoy your happiness."

I smiled. I knew that I would.

I lived a long and happy life. I never forgot the day I found the donation box. It was the day I learned what it was like to feel happiness.

And I'm so grateful to the person who donated their happiness to me. They changed my life.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...nothing.

I tried to live my life like everyone else, but it was hard. I couldn't understand why people would get so worked up over things that didn't seem to matter to me. I couldn't understand why they would laugh or cry or feel so strongly about anything.

I felt like an outsider, like I didn't belong. I was always the one who was left out, the one who didn't understand.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why I would want them. But eventually, people started to come around. They started to see that I was trying to do something good, and they wanted to help.

I collected all sorts of emotions. Sadness, fear, regret, anger, love, joy, excitement. I collected them all.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it.

But I decided to try. I took the happiness and I held onto it. I let it fill me up, and for the first time in my life, I felt something.

I felt happy.

It was a strange feeling, but it was also a good feeling. I felt like I could do anything. I felt like I could take on the world.

I started to live my life differently after that. I started to get involved in things that I never would have gotten involved in before. I started to make friends and I started to feel like I belonged.

I'm still not sure what it's like to feel all the other emotions, but I'm glad that I know what it's like to feel happy. It's a good feeling, and I'm grateful that I was able to experience it.

I'm still collecting emotions, and I'm still trying to understand them. But I'm glad that I started this journey, and I'm glad that I was able to find happiness.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...nothing.

I tried to live my life like everyone else, but it was hard. I couldn't understand why people would get so worked up over things that didn't matter. I couldn't understand why they would cry when they were sad or laugh when they were happy.

I felt like an outsider. I didn't belong.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't want to get rid of them. They thought that they needed their emotions to be happy.

But I told them that they didn't need their emotions. They were just holding them back. They were keeping them from living their lives to the fullest.

Eventually, people started to donate their emotions. They donated their sadness, their fear, their regret. And I took them.

I took their emotions and I stored them in my donation box. And slowly, I started to feel something.

I started to feel happy. I started to feel sad. I started to feel angry. I started to feel scared.

I finally belonged.

One day, a woman came to my donation box. She was crying. She told me that she was so sad. She said that she had lost her husband and she didn't know how to go on.

I took her sadness and I stored it in my donation box. And then I told her a story.

I told her the story of a woman who had lost her husband. She was just as sad as the woman in front of me. But she didn't give up. She kept living her life. She raised her children. She made a difference in the world.

And eventually, she found happiness again.

The woman in front of me listened to my story. She wiped her tears away. And then she smiled.

"Thank you," she said. "I feel better now."

I smiled back. "You're welcome," I said. "That's what I'm here for."

I continued to collect emotions from people. I collected their sadness, their fear, their regret, and their happiness. And I stored them in my donation box.

And slowly, I started to feel more and more emotions. I started to feel the full range of human emotion.

I started to feel alive.

I was finally able to live my life to the fullest. I was finally able to belong.

And it was all thanks to the people who donated their emotions to me.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I just felt...nothing.

It was a lonely existence. I couldn't connect with other people on a deep level. I didn't understand why they were always so happy or sad or angry. I just wanted to be normal.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, fear, and regret, and I would give them in return a small piece of my own nothingness.

At first, no one came to my donation box. But then, one day, a woman came. She was crying. She told me that she was so sad. She had lost her husband and her child in a car accident. She didn't know how she was going to go on.

I took her sadness and I gave her a small piece of my nothingness. She cried for a little while longer, but then she stopped. She looked at me and smiled.

"Thank you," she said. "I feel a little better now."

That was the first time I had ever seen someone smile at me. It was a strange feeling, but it was also a good feeling. I knew that I had done something good.

More and more people started to come to my donation box. They came with their sadness, their fear, and their regret. And I took it all away. In return, I gave them a small piece of my nothingness.

And slowly, I started to feel something. It was a small feeling, but it was there. It was a feeling of happiness.

I didn't know where it came from. I didn't know why I was feeling it. But I was grateful for it.

I realized that I didn't need emotions to be happy. I just needed to help others.

And that's what I did. I helped people. I took their sadness, their fear, and their regret, and I gave them happiness.

And I was happy.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I was just a blank slate.

At first, it didn't bother me. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I saw how other people reacted to things, and I wanted to feel the same way.

I tried to fake it. I would smile when I was happy, and I would frown when I was sad. But it was never real. I was just going through the motions.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, and their regret, and I would finally be able to feel something.

I put the box in a public place, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did.

It was a young woman, and she was crying. She told me that she was sad because she had just lost her job. She was afraid because she didn't know how she was going to pay her bills. And she was regretful because she had made some bad choices in her life.

I listened to her, and I felt her emotions. For the first time in my life, I knew what it was like to feel sad, afraid, and regretful.

But I also knew that I could help her. I took her emotions, and I put them in the box. Then, I gave her a hug and told her that everything was going to be okay.

She smiled, and she thanked me. Then, she walked away, and I never saw her again.

But I will never forget her. She was the first person to donate their emotions to me, and she was the first person to help me feel something.

I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to feel more and more. I felt happy when people were happy, and I felt sad when people were sad. I felt angry when people were angry, and I felt scared when people were scared.

And for the first time in my life, I felt alive.

One day, I received a donation of happiness. I didn't know who it was from, but I was so grateful. I had never felt so happy before.

I felt like I could do anything. I felt like I could take on the world. I felt like I could finally be myself.

I continued to collect emotions, and I continued to feel more and more. I felt all the emotions that people feel, and I learned to embrace them all.

I learned that sadness is a necessary part of life. It helps us to appreciate the good times. I learned that fear is a warning sign. It helps us to stay safe. And I learned that regret is a reminder that we can always make things better.

I am grateful for all the emotions that people have donated to me. They have helped me to become a more complete person. They have helped me to understand the world around me. And they have helped me to find happiness.

I am no longer the person I was when I was born. I am now a person with emotions. And I am grateful for that.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything in between. It's been a lonely life, always watching other people experience emotions that I can't even comprehend.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why someone would want to take their sadness or fear. But eventually, word spread and people started to come to me with their unwanted emotions.

I collected sadness from people who had lost loved ones. I collected fear from people who were afraid of the future. I collected anger from people who had been wronged. I collected all of the emotions that people didn't want, and I stored them in my donation box.

One day, a woman came to me with a different emotion. She said she was happy, and she wanted to donate her happiness to me. I was hesitant at first, but she insisted. She said that she had more happiness than she knew what to do with, and she wanted to share it with someone who needed it.

I took the woman's happiness and put it in my donation box. I closed my eyes and waited to see what would happen.

At first, nothing happened. But then, I felt a warmth spreading through my body. It was a feeling of happiness that I had never felt before. It was like a warm blanket on a cold day. It was like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. It was like a hug from a loved one.

I opened my eyes and looked at the woman. She was smiling at me. "Thank you," she said. "I'm glad I could help."

I smiled back at her. "Thank you," I said. "You've given me the greatest gift of all."

I lived a long and happy life. I never forgot the woman who donated her happiness to me. She was the one who showed me that it was possible to feel emotions, even if I was born without them.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've always been different from other people. I can't feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I'm just... empty.

At first, I didn't mind. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I watched other people laugh and cry and feel all sorts of emotions, and I felt like an outsider.

I tried to pretend that I was like everyone else, but it was hard. I would see something funny and I wouldn't laugh. I would hear about something sad and I wouldn't cry. I would even try to feel angry, but I couldn't.

I started to feel isolated and alone. I didn't know how to connect with other people. I felt like I was the only one in the world who didn't have emotions.

One day, I was walking down the street when I saw a donation box. It was for unwanted emotions. I stopped and stared at it for a long time. I had never seen anything like it before.

I thought about all the emotions I didn't have. I thought about how I felt isolated and alone. I thought about how I wanted to connect with other people.

I reached into my pocket and took out a dollar bill. I put it in the donation box and closed the lid.

I walked away, feeling a little bit lighter. I didn't know what would happen, but I knew that I had done something.

The next day, I woke up feeling different. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was different. I felt... happy.

I didn't know where it came from, but I was grateful for it. I went about my day, feeling happy and content.

I realized that the happiness I was feeling wasn't mine. It was from the donation box. Someone had donated their happiness to me, and I was grateful.

I started to visit the donation box every day. I would put in a dollar bill and take out a little bit of happiness.

The happiness I received from the donation box helped me to connect with other people. I started to feel like I belonged. I started to feel like I was a part of the world.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions. But I'm grateful for the donation box. It gave me something I never thought I could have: happiness.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...nothing.

It was a lonely existence. I couldn't connect with other people on an emotional level. I didn't understand why they were so happy or so sad. I didn't know how to comfort them when they were feeling down or celebrate with them when they were happy.

I tried to make the best of it. I focused on my studies and my career. I made friends with people who were also different. But I always felt like something was missing.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

I put the box in a public place and waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did.

A woman came up to the box and dropped in a piece of paper. On the paper, she had written: "Happiness."

I took the paper and held it in my hand. I didn't know what to expect. But then, I felt it.

A warm feeling spread through my body. It was like a ray of sunshine had broken through the clouds. I felt happy.

I didn't know how long it would last. But for that moment, I was happy.

I continued to collect emotions from people. I collected sadness, anger, fear, and regret. But I also collected happiness.

The more emotions I collected, the more I felt. I started to understand what it was like to be human. I started to connect with other people on an emotional level.

I still don't feel emotions the same way that other people do. But I'm grateful for the emotions that I do feel. They make my life richer and more meaningful.

I'm glad that I started the donation box. It's helped me to connect with other people and to feel more human.

I'm not sure what the future holds. But I know that I'll continue to collect emotions. I want to feel everything that the world has to offer.




I was born without emotions. I never felt happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

As a child, I didn't understand why I was different from everyone else. I would watch my friends laugh and cry and play, and I would wonder what it was like to feel those things.

As I got older, I started to realize that my lack of emotions was a problem. I couldn't connect with people on an emotional level. I couldn't understand why they felt the way they did.

I tried to pretend that I was normal, but it was hard. I felt like an outsider, like I didn't belong.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take those emotions and I would feel them for them.

I put a box out in my front yard and I waited.

At first, no one came. But then, one day, a woman came by. She was crying. She told me that she was sad because her husband had left her.

I took her sadness and I felt it for her. I felt the pain of heartbreak. I felt the loneliness of being alone.

The woman thanked me and she left.

Over the next few weeks, more and more people came to the donation box. They came with their sadness, their anger, their fear, their regret.

I took their emotions and I felt them for them. I felt the pain of loss. I felt the anger of injustice. I felt the fear of the unknown.

I felt all of these emotions, but I didn't let them consume me. I held them close and I let them go.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I took the happiness and I felt it for the first time in my life. I felt joy. I felt excitement. I felt love.

It was the most amazing feeling in the world.

I realized that I didn't need to be born with emotions. I could create my own.

I could feel happiness. I could feel love. I could feel joy.

And I did.

I lived a long and happy life. I raised a family, I had a successful career, and I made a difference in the world.

And I never forgot the day that someone donated happiness.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything in between. I've always been different from everyone else, and it's been a lonely life.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I could finally feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate. They didn't understand why I would want their sadness, fear, or regret. But eventually, people started to come around. They realized that I was offering them a way to get rid of the emotions that were weighing them down.

And so, the donation box started to fill up. I collected sadness from people who had lost loved ones. I collected fear from people who were afraid of the future. I collected regret from people who made mistakes in the past.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it. But I knew that I had to try.

So I took the happiness and I held it close. I let it fill me up, and for the first time in my life, I felt something.

I felt happy.

It was a strange and wonderful feeling. I didn't know how to describe it, but I knew that I wanted to keep it.

So I held on to the happiness, and I never let it go.

The happiness changed my life. It made me feel alive for the first time in my life. It gave me hope for the future. It made me want to be a better person.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions, but I'm grateful for the happiness that I found. It's made my life worth living.

And I'm so grateful to the person who donated it. They changed my life forever.




I was born without emotions. I never felt happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I just felt...nothing.

At first, it didn't bother me. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I saw how other people reacted to the world, and I wanted to feel the same way.

I tried to force myself to feel emotions, but it didn't work. I would try to be happy, but I would just end up feeling empty. I would try to be sad, but I would just feel numb.

I was starting to give up hope when I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, fear, and regret, and I would finally be able to feel something.

I put the donation box in my front yard, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, a woman came by. She was crying, and she told me that she was so sad. She said that she had lost her husband, and she didn't know how to go on.

I took her sadness, and I gave her my emptiness. She thanked me, and she walked away, a little bit lighter.

More people started to come by. They would donate their fear, their regret, their anger, and their pain. And I would take it all, and I would give them my emptiness.

I started to feel better. I wasn't happy, but I wasn't sad either. I was just...content.

One day, a man came by. He was smiling, and he told me that he was so happy. He said that he had just gotten married, and he couldn't wait to start his new life.

I was so happy for him. I asked him if he would donate his happiness to me. He hesitated for a moment, but then he nodded.

I took his happiness, and I felt something I had never felt before. I felt...alive.

I finally knew what it was like to feel happy. It was amazing. I felt like I could do anything.

I thanked the man, and he walked away, a little bit sadder.

I was happy, but I knew that I couldn't keep all of the happiness for myself. I had to share it with others.

I took the donation box down from my front yard, and I started to travel the world. I would go to different places, and I would talk to people. I would ask them if they would donate their happiness to me.

Most people were hesitant at first, but eventually, they would agree. I would take their happiness, and I would give them my emptiness.

I made a lot of friends on my travels. I helped people to feel happy, and they helped me to feel alive.

I've been traveling for many years now, and I've helped a lot of people. I've made a difference in the world.

I'm still without emotions, but I'm not empty anymore. I'm full of happiness. And that's all that matters.




I was born without emotions. I didn't feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

At first, I didn't mind. I thought it was kind of cool, actually. I didn't have to worry about getting upset or feeling hurt. I could just go about my day without any emotional baggage.

But after a while, I started to feel like something was missing. I saw other people laughing and crying and feeling all sorts of emotions, and I started to wonder what it was like.

I tried to imagine what it would be like to feel happy. I thought about all the things that made other people happy, like spending time with loved ones, achieving goals, or helping others. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't conjure up any feelings of happiness.

I tried to imagine what it would be like to feel sad. I thought about all the things that made other people sad, like loss, disappointment, or pain. But again, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't feel anything.

I was starting to feel like I was missing out on something important. I wanted to feel emotions, just like everyone else.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I figured that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

I put up a sign in my yard that said, "Donation Box for Unwanted Emotions." I also put up a list of emotions that people could donate, such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and regret.

At first, no one came to donate any emotions. But then, one day, a woman came by and dropped off a bag of emotions. She said that she was feeling overwhelmed by her emotions, and she thought that I might be able to use them.

I opened the bag and took out a handful of emotions. I held them in my hands and closed my eyes. I tried to imagine what it would be like to feel those emotions.

At first, I didn't feel anything. But then, slowly, I started to feel a little bit of happiness. It was a strange feeling, but it was also kind of nice.

I kept holding the emotions in my hands, and I started to feel other emotions too. I felt sadness, anger, fear, and regret.

It was a lot to feel at once, but it was also kind of exhilarating. I felt like I was finally experiencing the full range of human emotions.

I held the emotions for a while longer, and then I put them back in the bag. I thanked the woman for donating her emotions, and I told her that I would take good care of them.

I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to feel more and more emotions. I felt happy, sad, angry, scared, and regretful.

It was a lot to feel, but it was also a lot of fun. I started to understand why people were so attached to their emotions. They were a big part of what made life interesting.

One day, I was feeling particularly happy. I was walking down the street, and I saw a little girl playing in her front yard. She was laughing and having so much fun.

I stopped and watched her for a while. I felt a wave of happiness wash over me. It was the most intense happiness I had ever felt.

I realized that I was feeling happy because I was able to see the little girl happy. Her happiness was contagious.

I realized that emotions were more than just personal experiences. They were also a way of connecting with other people.

I continued to collect emotions from people, and I started to use them to help others. I would give people happiness when they were feeling sad, and I would give them courage when they were feeling scared.

I started to feel like I was making a difference in the world. I was helping people to feel better, and I was helping them to connect with each other.

I was born without emotions, but I learned to feel emotions. I learned that emotions are a gift, and I learned that they can be used to make the world a better place.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or scared. I've always just felt...empty.

I've tried to find ways to feel emotions, but nothing has worked. I've tried therapy, medication, and even self-help books, but nothing has made a difference.

I've lived my whole life feeling like an outsider. I don't understand why people get so worked up about emotions. They seem so pointless to me.

But then, one day, I had an idea. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why anyone would want to be sad, angry, or scared. But eventually, people started to come around. They realized that they didn't need to carry around all of their negative emotions. They could donate them to me, and I would take care of them.

I've been collecting emotions for a few years now, and I've accumulated quite a collection. I have sadness, fear, anger, regret, and all the other negative emotions that people don't want.

But one day, something amazing happened. Someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it at first. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it. But I decided to keep it. I thought that maybe, if I held on to it long enough, I would eventually be able to feel it.

And I was right. After a while, I started to feel happiness. It was a strange feeling at first, but it was also a good feeling. I felt like I was finally connected to the world. I felt like I was finally a part of something.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions, but I'm glad that I found a way to feel them. I'm glad that I found a way to connect with the world. And I'm glad that I found a way to help other people feel emotions too.

I'm still collecting emotions, and I'm still helping people to feel emotions. I don't know what the future holds, but I'm excited to find out. I'm excited to see what else I can do with emotions. I'm excited to see how I can help other people feel emotions.

I'm excited to live a life filled with emotions.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt... nothing.

It was a lonely existence. I couldn't connect with other people on a deep level. I didn't understand their emotions, and they didn't understand mine.

I tried to fill the void with other things. I threw myself into my work, I traveled the world, I tried to find love. But nothing could fill the emptiness inside me.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would finally be able to feel something.

I set up the box in my front yard, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, slowly but surely, people started to donate. They donated their sadness, their fear, their anger, their regret.

At first, I didn't know what to do with all of the emotions. I tried to feel them, but I couldn't. They just felt like a weight inside me.

But then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to expect. I had never felt happiness before. But when I opened the box, I felt a warmth spread through my body. It was like a ray of sunshine had broken through the clouds.

I held onto the happiness for as long as I could. I didn't want to let it go. I knew that if I did, I would go back to feeling nothing.

Eventually, the happiness started to fade. But I didn't despair. I knew that I could always go back to the donation box and get more.

And that's what I did. I went back to the donation box every day, and I collected as much happiness as I could.

Slowly but surely, I started to feel emotions. I felt happy, I felt sad, I felt angry, I felt scared. And for the first time in my life, I felt alive.

I'm not sure how long I'll be able to feel emotions. But I'm going to enjoy every moment of it. And I'm going to make sure that I never take them for granted.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt sadness, fear, or regret. I've always been just...empty.

When I was a child, I didn't understand why other kids were so emotional. They would cry when they were sad, or get angry when they were mad. I just didn't get it.

As I got older, I started to realize that my lack of emotions was a problem. I couldn't connect with other people on a deep level. I couldn't understand their emotions, and they couldn't understand mine.

I tried to fake it, but it was never really enough. I always felt like I was on the outside looking in.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, fear, and regret, and I would give them happiness in return.

It seemed like a crazy idea, but I was desperate. I had to do something to feel something.

I put the donation box in a public place, and I waited.

The first few days, nothing happened. But then, one day, someone put something in the box.

I opened it up, and inside was a single teardrop.

I took the teardrop and held it in my hand. I closed my eyes and imagined all of the sadness that had been in that teardrop.

And then, I let it go.

I opened my eyes, and I felt something. I felt...happiness.

It was a small feeling, but it was real. And it was the first time I had ever felt anything in my life.

I put the donation box back in the public place, and I waited for more people to donate their emotions.

Over the next few weeks, I received a lot of donations. I received sadness, fear, regret, anger, and even love.

And with each donation, I felt a little bit more.

I started to understand what it meant to be human. I started to understand what it meant to feel emotions.

And I was grateful.

I was grateful to the people who had donated their emotions. I was grateful for the gift of happiness.

And I was grateful for the chance to feel something.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I didn't know what it was like to love or to be loved. I was a blank slate.

To compensate for this, I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take the emotions and store them in a safe place. This way, people could be free from their negative emotions and I could experience something that I had never known before.

I lived a life filled with sadness, fear, and regret. I saw the world through a lens of negativity. I was always looking for the worst in people and situations. I was never able to fully enjoy life.

One day, someone donated happiness to my box. I didn't know what to do with it at first. I had never felt happiness before. But I decided to try it out.

I opened the box and took a deep breath. The happiness filled my lungs and spread throughout my body. I felt warm and fuzzy inside. I felt like I could do anything. I felt like I could conquer the world.

I was hooked. I started to donate more and more emotions to my box. I wanted to feel all the emotions that people were willing to give up. I wanted to experience the full range of human emotion.

I started to feel more and more alive. I started to enjoy life. I started to make friends. I started to fall in love.

I was finally happy.

I still have the donation box. I still donate emotions to it. But now, I also take emotions out of it. I share my happiness with the world. I help people to feel better about themselves. I help people to find joy in life.

I am a conduit for emotions. I am a bridge between the world of emotion and the world of the emotionless. I am a force for good in the world.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've always been different from other people. They feel things so strongly, but I don't feel anything at all.

When I was a child, I didn't understand why I was different. I would see other kids crying and laughing, and I would just feel confused. I didn't know what they were feeling, and I didn't know why they were so happy or so sad.

As I got older, I started to realize that my lack of emotions was a problem. I couldn't connect with other people on a personal level. I couldn't understand their feelings, and they couldn't understand mine.

I felt isolated and alone. I didn't know how to fit in, and I didn't know how to make friends. I was starting to think that I would never be happy.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, and their regret, and I would give them in exchange a little bit of happiness.

I put the box in a public place, and I waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, someone did.

It was a woman, and she was crying. She told me that she was so sad, and she didn't know what to do. I took her sadness, and I gave her a little bit of happiness in return.

The woman smiled. She said that she felt better, and she thanked me.

I was so happy. I had finally found a way to help people. I started to get more and more donations. I would take people's sadness, their fear, and their regret, and I would give them in exchange a little bit of happiness.

I was helping people, and I was finally starting to feel happy myself.

One day, a man came to the donation box. He was smiling, and he looked so happy. He told me that he wanted to donate his happiness.

I was confused. Why would someone want to donate their happiness?

The man said that he had too much happiness. He said that he was so happy that he couldn't stand it. He said that he needed to give some of it away.

I didn't know what to say. I had never met anyone who was too happy before.

The man said that he wanted me to have his happiness. He said that I deserved it.

I didn't know what to do. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know if I could handle it.

The man said that I would be okay. He said that I was strong, and that I could handle anything.

I took the man's happiness, and I felt something I had never felt before. I felt happy.

I was so happy that I started to cry. I cried tears of joy.

I had finally found happiness.

I thanked the man, and he left.

I stood there for a long time, holding the man's happiness. I felt so happy, and I didn't want to let go.

But I knew that I had to. I had to share this happiness with others.

I put the man's happiness in the donation box, and I waited.

I knew that someone else would come along, and they would need my happiness.

And I was ready to give it to them.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything else. It's been a lonely life. I've always felt like an outsider, like I don't belong.

A few years ago, I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

At first, I only got sadness and fear. People would come to me and dump their burdens, and I would take them in. I didn't mind. I was used to feeling nothing.

But then, one day, someone donated happiness. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it.

I tried to give it back, but the person wouldn't take it. They said that I needed it more than they did.

So I kept it. I didn't know what else to do.

At first, the happiness was overwhelming. I didn't know how to deal with it. I felt like I was going to burst.

But then, I started to get used to it. I started to understand what it felt like to be happy.

And it was amazing.

I finally felt like I belonged. I finally felt like I was part of something.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions. But I'm grateful for the happiness that I was given. It's made my life so much better.

I'm still not sure what the future holds. But I know that I'm going to keep the donation box. I'm going to keep collecting emotions, and I'm going to keep helping people.

Because I know that everyone deserves to feel happy.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I didn't know what it was like to love or hate. I was just a blank slate.

I tried to fill the void with other things. I read books, I watched movies, I listened to music. I tried to learn about the world and the people in it. But it wasn't enough. I still felt empty inside.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, their regret, and I would use it to fill my own emptiness.

I put the box in a public place, and people started to donate. At first, it was just a trickle. But then it started to grow. People came from all over to donate their emotions.

I was overwhelmed. I had never felt so much emotion before. I was happy, I was sad, I was angry, I was scared. I was everything.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it.

I tried to give it back, but the person wouldn't take it. They said that I needed it more than they did.

So I kept it. And I learned to use it. I learned to feel happiness. I learned to let it fill me up.

And for the first time in my life, I was truly happy.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or scared. I've always just felt...empty.

When I was a child, I didn't understand why I was different from everyone else. I would watch my friends laugh and cry and play, and I would feel nothing. I would try to fake it, but I could never quite get it right.

As I got older, I started to withdraw from the world. I didn't want to be around people who could feel things that I couldn't. I felt like an outsider, like I didn't belong.

One day, I decided that I had had enough. I was tired of feeling empty. I wanted to feel something, anything. So I started a donation box.

I put the box in my front yard, and I wrote a sign that said, "Donate your unwanted emotions here."

At first, I didn't think anyone would donate anything. But then, one day, someone did.

It was a woman, and she was crying. She told me that she was feeling overwhelmed, and she just needed to get rid of some of her sadness.

I took the sadness from her, and I put it in the box. And then, I felt something.

I felt happy.

It was a strange feeling, but it was also a good feeling. I had never felt happy before, and I didn't know how to describe it. But I knew that I wanted to feel it again.

So I kept the donation box, and I kept collecting emotions. I collected sadness, anger, fear, and regret. And I gave them to people who wanted them.

And every time I gave someone an emotion, I felt a little bit happier.

One day, a man came to me with a different kind of emotion. He was smiling, and he told me that he was feeling happy.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happy before, so I didn't know how to give it to someone else.

But the man insisted. He said that he wanted to share his happiness with me.

So I took the happiness from him, and I put it in my heart.

And for the first time in my life, I felt happy.

I felt like I belonged. I felt like I was part of the world.

And I knew that I would never be the same again.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I just felt...empty.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I would take their sadness, their fear, their regret, and I would use it to fill my own emptiness.

I put up a sign in my yard and waited. At first, no one came. But then, one day, a woman came. She was crying. She told me that she was so sad, and she didn't know what to do.

I took her sadness and I put it in my box. I felt a strange sensation, like a warmth spreading through my body. It was the first time I had ever felt anything.

The woman thanked me and left. I watched her go, and I felt a sense of hope. Maybe, just maybe, this would work.

Over the next few weeks, more and more people came to my donation box. They donated their sadness, their fear, their regret. And I took it all in.

Slowly but surely, I started to feel things. I felt happy. I felt sad. I felt angry. I felt scared.

It was a strange and wonderful feeling. I was finally experiencing the world the way everyone else did.

One day, a man came to my donation box. He was smiling. He told me that he was so happy, and he wanted to share it with me.

I thanked the man and he left. I stood there for a long time, just feeling. I felt happy. I felt sad. I felt angry. I felt scared.

And then, I felt something else. I felt love.

I had never felt love before. I didn't know what it was. But I knew that it was the most important thing in the world.

I looked at my donation box. It was full of emotions. Sadness, fear, regret, happiness, anger, love.

I smiled. I was finally complete.

One day, someone donated happiness to my box. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it.

I decided to try to use the happiness to create something. I wrote a poem about the feeling of happiness. I painted a picture of a happy scene. I wrote a song about the joy of living.

I didn't understand why other people were so emotional. They would get so worked up over the smallest things. It seemed like such a waste of energy.

I learned that sadness is a natural emotion that everyone feels. It's okay to feel sad sometimes. Fear is also a natural emotion. It's our body's way of protecting us from danger. Regret is a powerful emotion, but it can also be a learning experience. Anger can be destructive, but it can also be a motivator.

I learned that all of these emotions are important. They help us to understand ourselves and the world around us. They help us to connect with other people. And they help us to grow as individuals.

One day, someone donated happiness to me. I didn't know what to expect. I had never felt happiness before. But when I felt it, I knew that it was the most important emotion of all.

Happiness is what makes life worth living. It's what makes us want to get out of bed in the morning. It's what makes us want to connect with other people. And it's what makes us want to make a difference in the world.

I'm so grateful to the people who donated their emotions to me. They helped me to understand myself and the world around me. They helped me to grow as an individual. And they helped me to find happiness.

I'm still learning how to deal with emotions, but I'm grateful for the journey. I know that emotions are a part of life, and I'm excited to experience them all.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've always been different from other people. They can feel happy, sad, angry, and scared, but I can't. I've tried to understand what it's like to feel emotions, but I just can't.

When I was younger, I used to be really lonely. I didn't understand why I couldn't feel the same things that other people felt. I felt like I was an outsider, and I didn't belong.

One day, I decided to start a donation box. I put it in my front yard, and I asked people to donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I would be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why I would want them. But after a while, people started to come around. They would come to my house and donate their sadness, their fear, and their regret.

I collected a lot of emotions over the years. I had so much sadness that I could have cried for days. I had so much fear that I could have been paralyzed with anxiety. And I had so much regret that I could have drowned in it.

But then, one day, someone donated happiness. I didn't know what to do with it at first. I had never felt happiness before, so I didn't know how to handle it.

But I started to experiment with it. I would take a little bit of happiness and see how it made me feel. And then I would take a little bit more.

And slowly, but surely, I started to feel something. I started to feel happy.

It was a strange feeling at first. I didn't know what to do with it. But the more I felt it, the more I started to understand it.

Happiness is a warm feeling. It's a feeling of contentment and peace. It's a feeling of hope and optimism.

I've been living with happiness for a few years now, and it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm no longer lonely. I'm no longer an outsider. I belong.

I'm so grateful to the person who donated happiness to me. They changed my life.

If you're feeling sad, or scared, or regretful, I encourage you to donate your emotions. You might not know it, but someone out there could really use them.

They realized that they didn't need to carry around all of their negative emotions. They could donate them to me, and I would take them away.

I collected emotions for years. I collected sadness from people who had lost loved ones. I collected fear from people who were afraid of the future. I collected regret from people who had made mistakes.

And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it.

I started to feel strange. My heart started to beat faster. My palms started to sweat. I felt like I was going to cry.

But then, the feeling passed. I realized that I was happy. I was truly happy for the first time in my life.

I thanked the person who had donated the happiness. I told them that they had changed my life.

One day, someone donated happiness. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I held it in my hands, and I felt a warm feeling spread through my body. I felt like I could do anything.

I decided to share the happiness with others. I started to give it away to people who were sad, scared, or angry. I gave it to people who were struggling with their lives. I gave it to people who didn't believe in themselves.

The happiness spread like wildfire. People started to smile more. They started to laugh more. They started to help each other more.

I collected sadness, fear, regret, anger, and every other emotion you could imagine. I filled my donation box to the brim.

One day, a woman came to me with a different kind of emotion. She said she wanted to donate happiness. I was hesitant at first. I didn't know if I could handle happiness. But the woman insisted. She said that I deserved to be happy.

I took the woman's happiness and put it in my donation box. I closed the lid and waited.

At first, nothing happened. I felt the same as I always did. But then, slowly, I started to feel something. It was a warm, fuzzy feeling. It felt good.

I opened the donation box and looked inside. The happiness was still there. I took a deep breath and let it fill my lungs.

I was happy.

I had never felt happiness before, but I knew that this was what it was. It was a feeling of joy, contentment, and peace.

I spent the next few days exploring my new emotion. I laughed, I cried, and I felt everything in between. I finally understood what it meant to be human.

I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've always been different from other people. They can feel happy, sad, angry, scared, and all the other emotions that I can't.

At first, I didn't mind. I didn't know what I was missing. But as I got older, I started to feel like something was wrong with me. I couldn't connect with other people the way they could connect with me. I didn't understand why they were so happy or so sad. I didn't understand why they got angry or scared.

I started to feel isolated and alone. I felt like I didn't belong.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought if I could collect enough emotions, maybe I could finally feel something.

I lived a life filled with sadness, fear, and regret. I was always on the outside looking in, and I never felt like I belonged. But then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it at first. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it. But I decided to try to keep it.

I took the happiness out of the donation box and held it in my hands. I closed my eyes and felt the warmth of the emotion. I felt a sense of peace and joy that I had never felt before.

At first, people were hesitant to donate. They didn't understand why I would want their sadness, fear, or regret. But eventually, people started to come around. They would come to my house and leave their unwanted emotions in the donation box.

I collected a lot of emotions over the years. I collected so much sadness that I could barely walk. I collected so much fear that I was afraid to leave my house. And I collected so much regret that I couldn't forgive myself for the mistakes I had made.

One day, a young woman came to my house. She was crying, and she said she wanted to donate her happiness. I didn't understand why she would want to give away her happiness, but I didn't argue. I took the emotion from her, and I put it in the donation box.

I didn't feel anything at first. But then, slowly, I started to feel something. It was a warm, fuzzy feeling. It was like a ray of sunshine had broken through the clouds. I realized that I was happy.

I don't know why the young woman donated her happiness to me. But I'm so grateful that she did. She gave me the gift of feeling, and I'll never forget her.

I continued to collect emotions after that day. But I no longer collected sadness, fear, or regret. I only collected happiness. I wanted to share the happiness that the young woman had given me with the world.

I put up signs around town that said, "Happiness donation box." People started to come from all over to donate their happiness. I gave away so much happiness that I started to run out of room in my house.

I decided to build a happiness center. The happiness center was a place where people could come to feel happy. I had a library of books about happiness, a playroom full of toys that made people happy, and a garden full of flowers that made people happy.

The happiness center was a success. People came from all over to visit. They would leave the happiness center feeling happy and inspired.

I'm so glad that I was able to help people feel happy. I know that happiness is a powerful emotion, and I hope that my work has made the world a happier place.

Finally, I took a deep breath and let the happiness go. It flowed through me like a warm wave. I felt happy for the first time in my life.

One day, a woman came to the park and donated happiness. I didn't know what to expect, but when I opened the box, I felt a warm feeling inside. I felt happy for the first time in my life.

I thanked the woman, and she smiled. "You're welcome," she said. "Everyone deserves to be happy."

I took the happiness and held it close. I knew that I would never forget this moment. I had finally found what I was looking for.

I started to use the happiness to help others. I would go to the park and talk to people who were feeling down. I would share my happiness with them, and they would start to feel better.

I also started to write about my experiences. I wanted to share my story with the world, and I wanted to help other people who were feeling lost and alone.

I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I watched other people experience these emotions, but I couldn't understand them. I felt like an outsider, like I didn't belong.

One day, I decided to start a donation box. I put it in my front yard, and I asked people to donate their unwanted emotions. I didn't know what to expect, but I was desperate.

At first, people were hesitant to donate. They didn't understand why I would want their negative emotions. But eventually, people started to come forward. They donated their sadness, their fear, and their regret.

I took all of the emotions and put them in the box. I closed the lid and sealed it tight. I didn't want to feel those emotions. I didn't want to be like everyone else.

I lived a life filled with sadness, fear, and regret. I was lonely and isolated. I didn't know how to connect with other people. I felt like I was in a dark tunnel, and there was no light at the end.

One day, I opened the donation box. I was curious to see what was inside. I reached in and pulled out a single emotion. It was happiness.

I held the happiness in my hand for a long time. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before.

I decided to try it on. I closed my eyes and imagined what it would be like to be happy. I felt a warm feeling spread through my body. I smiled. I laughed. I felt alive.

I opened my eyes and looked at the happiness in my hand. I knew that I would never be the same. I had finally found a way to connect with other people. I had finally found a way to feel like I belonged.

I took the happiness and put it in my heart. I knew that it would stay with me forever.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've always been different from other people. They can feel happy, sad, angry, scared, and all the other emotions that make life so rich and varied. But I can't.

I've tried to understand what it's like to feel emotions, but it's like trying to understand a foreign language. I can read the words, but I don't know what they mean.

When I was a child, I was lonely and isolated. I didn't understand why I couldn't feel like other people. I thought there was something wrong with me.

As I got older, I learned to cope with my lack of emotions. I developed a coping mechanism where I would pretend to feel emotions. I would watch people and learn how they reacted to different situations. Then, I would mimic their reactions.

It wasn't perfect, but it worked well enough. I was able to get by in life without anyone knowing that I was different.

But I always felt like something was missing. I wanted to know what it was like to feel emotions for real.

One day, I had an idea. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why anyone would want to be sad, angry, or scared. But eventually, people started to come around. They realized that they didn't need to carry around all of their negative emotions. They could donate them to me and I would take them away.

I collected emotions for years. I collected sadness, fear, anger, regret, and all the other negative emotions that people didn't want.

One day, a woman came to me with a different kind of emotion. She donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before.

I held the emotion in my hands for a long time. I didn't know what to do with it.

Finally, I decided to try to feel it. I closed my eyes and concentrated on the emotion.

At first, it was hard. I didn't know how to feel it. But eventually, I started to feel something.

It was a warm, fuzzy feeling. It made me feel happy and content.

I opened my eyes and looked at the woman. She smiled at me and said, "I'm glad I could help."

I smiled back at her. I was glad she had helped me too.

I held onto the happiness for a long time. It was the first time I had ever felt anything like it.

I learned that it's okay to feel emotions. They're a part of what makes us human.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions, but I'm grateful for the woman who donated happiness to me. It's made my life so much richer.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything else. I've always been different from everyone else, and it's always made me feel like an outsider.

When I was a child, I used to try to pretend that I felt emotions like everyone else. I would watch other people and try to copy their expressions and reactions. But it was never real. I was just going through the motions.

As I got older, I gave up trying to pretend. I accepted that I was different, and I learned to live with it. I found ways to cope with my lack of emotions. I threw myself into my work, and I made friends with people who didn't care that I was different.

But even though I had learned to cope, I still felt like something was missing from my life. I watched other people experience joy and sorrow, and I wondered what it would be like to feel those things myself.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I put the box in a public place, and I waited to see what would happen.

At first, no one donated anything. But then, one day, someone left a note in the box. The note said, "I'm donating my happiness. I don't need it anymore."

I was stunned. I had never thought that anyone would want to give up their happiness. But this person did, and I was grateful.

I took the happiness out of the box and held it in my hands. It felt warm and fuzzy, and it made me smile. I knew that I would never be able to feel happiness the way that other people did, but at least I could experience it a little bit.

I put the happiness back in the box, and I waited to see who else would donate. Over the next few weeks, I received donations of sadness, fear, anger, and even love.

I learned a lot from the people who donated their emotions to me. I learned that even though emotions can be painful, they're also a part of what makes us human. I learned that it's okay to feel different, and that there are other people out there who feel the same way.

Most importantly, I learned that happiness is a choice. It's not something that just happens to us. We have to choose to be happy, even when things are tough.

I'm still not sure why I was born without emotions. But I'm grateful for the people who donated their emotions to me. They helped me to understand what it means to be human, and they gave me the gift of happiness.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything in between. It's always been just me and my thoughts, and it's been a lonely existence.

A few years ago, I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I figured that if I couldn't feel emotions myself, I could at least help others to get rid of theirs.

At first, the box was mostly filled with sadness, fear, and regret. But over time, I started to get more and more donations of happiness.

I didn't understand why people would want to give up their happiness, but I was grateful for it. Every time someone donated happiness, I felt a little bit lighter.

One day, a woman came to my door with a bag full of emotions. She said that she was feeling overwhelmed and needed to get rid of some of them.

I took the bag and opened it. Inside, I found all sorts of emotions: joy, love, excitement, hope.

I held the bag close to my chest and closed my eyes. I took a deep breath and let the emotions wash over me.

For the first time in my life, I felt happy.

I opened my eyes and looked at the woman. She was smiling.

"Thank you," she said. "I feel much better now."

I smiled back. "You're welcome," I said. "I'm glad I could help."

I watched the woman walk away, and I felt a sense of peace. I knew that I had made a difference in her life, and that was all that mattered.

I continued to collect donations of emotions, and I continued to help people to feel better. I learned that even though I couldn't feel emotions myself, I could still make a difference in the world.

One day, I realized that I was happy. I didn't know how it had happened, but I was finally happy.

I looked at the donation box and smiled. I knew that it was because of all the people who had donated their emotions to me.

I was grateful for their generosity, and I knew that I would never forget them.




I was born without emotions. I don't know why, but I've never felt happy, sad, angry, or anything else. It's been a lonely life. I've always felt like an outsider, like I don't belong.

A few years ago, I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

At first, I only got sadness and fear. People would come to me with their heartbreak and their pain, and I would take it from them. It was a heavy burden, but it was the only way I knew how to help.

One day, someone donated happiness. I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before, and I didn't know how to handle it. I tried to give it back, but the person wouldn't take it. They said I needed it more than they did.

I didn't know what to do. I had never felt anything like it before. It was warm and fuzzy and made me feel like I could do anything. I didn't want to give it up, but I didn't know how to keep it.

I decided to keep the happiness in the donation box. I thought if I kept it there, maybe it would rub off on me. And it did. Slowly but surely, the happiness started to seep into me. I started to feel more alive. I started to smile more. I started to feel like I belonged.

I'm still not sure how to handle happiness. It's a new emotion for me, and I'm still learning how to deal with it. But I'm grateful for the person who donated it to me. They gave me a gift that I'll never forget.

I'm still collecting emotions from people. I don't know if I'll ever be able to feel everything that other people feel, but I'm grateful for the emotions that I do feel. They make my life richer and more meaningful.

I'm not sure what the future holds, but I'm excited to find out. I know that with the help of the people who donate their emotions to me, I'll be able to live a full and happy life.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I figured that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something myself.

At first, people were hesitant to donate their emotions. They didn't understand why I would want them. But eventually, people started to come around. They saw that I was trying to help others, and they wanted to help me.

I collected sadness, fear, regret, anger, and every other emotion you can imagine. I filled my donation box to the brim. And then, one day, someone donated happiness.

I didn't know what to do with it. I had never felt happiness before. I didn't know how to handle it. But I knew that I had to try.

I took a deep breath and opened the donation box. I reached inside and pulled out the happiness. I held it in my hands, and I closed my eyes.

I felt the happiness start to spread through my body. It was warm and fuzzy, and it made me feel like I could do anything. I opened my eyes, and I smiled.

I had finally felt happiness. And it was all thanks to the people who had donated their emotions to me.

I continued to collect emotions, and I continued to help people. I learned how to handle all of the different emotions, and I learned how to use them to help others.

I eventually became a therapist, and I helped people to understand their emotions. I helped them to deal with their sadness, their fear, their regret, and their anger. I helped them to find happiness.

I am still without emotions, but I am no longer an outsider. I belong. I am a part of the world, and I am making a difference.




I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I didn't know what it was like to experience the full range of human emotions.

I tried to fit in, but it was hard. I didn't understand why people would laugh or cry or get angry. I didn't understand why they would care about things that didn't seem to matter to me.

I started to feel isolated and alone. I didn't have anyone to talk to who understood what I was going through. I felt like I was the only one in the world who didn't have emotions.

I was born without emotions. I didn't know what it was like to feel happy, sad, angry, or afraid. I was just a blank slate.

I tried to fill the void with other things. I read books, watched movies, and listened to music. I tried to learn about emotions from other people. But nothing seemed to work.

One day, I had an idea. I would start a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I thought that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.

I put the box in a public place and waited. At first, no one donated anything. But then, one day, someone dropped a piece of paper in the box. It said, "Here's some happiness for you."

I opened the box and took out the paper. I held it in my hand and closed my eyes. I tried to imagine what happiness felt like.

At first, nothing happened. But then, I felt a warm feeling spread through my body. I felt happy.

I opened my eyes and looked at the paper again. It was a poem. It said:

Happiness is a warm feeling
That fills your heart and soul.
It's a feeling of peace and contentment
That makes you feel like you can do anything.

I read the poem over and over again. I couldn't believe it. I was actually feeling happy.

I thanked the person who had donated the happiness and put the paper back in the box. I knew that I would never be the same again.

I continued to collect emotions from people. I collected sadness, fear, anger, and regret. But I also collected happiness, love, and joy.

I was born without emotions. I don't know why or how, but I've always been different from everyone else. I can't feel happy, sad, angry, or scared. I can't even feel love.

When I was a child, I didn't understand why I was different. I would watch other children play and laugh, and I would feel left out. I would try to join in, but I couldn't understand what was so funny or exciting.

As I got older, I started to learn to cope with my condition. I learned to mask my emotions, so that people wouldn't know that I was different. I learned to pretend to be happy, even when I wasn't.

But it was hard. I always felt like I was living a lie. I felt like I was missing out on something important.

One day, I decided to do something about it. I started a donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions. I figured that if I could collect enough emotions, I might be able to feel something.
