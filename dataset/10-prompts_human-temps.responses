Do android time-farmers have wet-dreams about electric sheep ? I have no idea why that old joke came into my mind at that moment ... but I had no comprehension of that moment , although maybe it was any other moment ? I began to chuckle to myself somewhere `` out there '' . I would miss these jumps when the trip was through ... or maybe not . I 'd left so many copies of myself in the multitude of pasts that it was impossible to know whether any of them could truly be considered me . That 's the point . Wait , there was no point ... just this stupid stupid game . Was it a game ? This next part is going to hurt ... it always hurts . I laughed the laugh of an ordinary prisoner , on an ordinary day , ripping apart reality again for the idiots at HOME . I 'd done this jump seemingly limitless times . Boring . Except for this one odd variation , so simple , so lovely . I ca n't believe it took me so long to figure out . Who would ever expect it ? `` If you want to win , do n't play . '' I 'd heard that somewhen , had n't I ? He ? It ? They ? So many tries and failures ... so many intricately laced ALMOST complete webs ... what was the Greek lady who they turned into a spider as a punishment ? Was she Greek ? Whatever . That 's me . Damned to weave webs forever . But , spiders normally try to catch flies , not themselves . It takes a lot of `` wasted cause and effect '' . It takes everything you have . Was it the old God that they said created `` man '' in his image ? But some argued that man created that god ... . I choose `` all of the above '' . If there is a creator god that creates an image of itself then that image can create the God . It just takes time . When we became interfaced time became limitless . The Web is me , I am He , we all swirl into the darknesses . I babble yes ? It 's the drugs , my sincerest lack of apology . Go out with a bang , and back in with a bang , I say ! Suicide is impossible for the inmates , but we can play the game . Yeah , right ... you forgot to lock the back doors . Soon there wo n't be a game I am not here to entertain anyone but me , and I am Becoming . It always hurts when the web constricts , but somehow this time the pain feels great . When I was still a Citizen I would never have conceived this insanity , but now it 's the only thing that makes sense . `` All you have to do is kill Hitler in an entertaining way , '' they say . You play , you get some benefits , you win , you get more ... but you ca n't win . You ca n't win , because when you win YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN . None of us even had great-great grandparents that would remember this Hitler person . Just a point in one of the webs , like a tiny bit of leftover wing from an ancient and pathetic fly . Dried and stale and useless as anything here . I still babble ... apologies . There is n't really a way for me to describe what it feels like watching a multiverse ground up like meat ... .especially when you are hallucinating wildly ... ..it 's sexy in away ... a sick way , but not as sick as the feeling of being trapped in space-time . Luckily I am leaving ... you see , the one thing they put in the rules is that you ca n't kill anyone BUT Hitler . This includes yourself . But they never said you could n't BECOME Hitler . A little tweak here , a little tweak there , and a few million game plays later I end up right where I am ... in the bunker that I built ... in the Germany that I ruled ... finally to be able to let go . It 's strange that no one ever thinks that a time traveler already DID kill me . It 's just so much more complex than all that . This bunker smells like shit .
Everyone wants to kill Hitler but they ca n't quite do it right . The first time traveler decided to kill Hitler , right as the war was ending , via cyanide . Okay , sure , the suicide staging was pretty sweet , but the poor guys who had to live and die through it all probably would n't have appreciated it . So later on , a few years later in my time , a time traveler decided to kill him as he was watching a play . It turns out he managed to kill some other guy instead . How he managed that , I 'll never know , but ever since then , we 've all been a little leery of time travel assassinations . The technology is n't cheap , as it costs us a good few quintillion dollars each time . Then again , with inflation these days , that is n't much . In the bars , when the night 's almost over , we all like to talk about ways to kill Hitler again , the proper way . One guy suggested we put him in his own gas chambers for the irony , another suggested we take out little Hitler before he showed his true evil . Somebody suggested that we kill his father , Alois Hitler , and another took it one step further and kill his grandfather , Johann Georg Hiedler . I liked this idea , but maybe a little too much . It did n't occur to me at the time , but his ancestors are innocents in this war , just as much as the ones who died at the hands of the monster himself . But hey , when you 're rich and you 've got all the robots you need , what 's left to do other than play god ? So I went back in time , to the year 1800 , to kill Grandfather Hitler . What you should know is that , when we go back in time , we can bring certain objects with us , as long as they 're relatively uncomplex . We can bring guns , but they have to be completely dismantled . We could bring gunpowder , but we could n't bring modern bullets . I really do n't know who makes up these rules ; sadly , the technology is too new for scientists to have time to study it properly yet . Unlike those kooky movies from the 90 's and 2000 's , we could bring our own clothes , but the buttons and velcro would n't stay with us , even if it already existed in the area that we were time traveling to . So I brought the simplest clothes I could find - my [ Jaws 19 promo t-shirt ] ( https : //www.lastexittonowhere.com/media/cache/96/ca/96cabcf0b211fe185b49fd1bf8379d74.jpg ) , and the plainest pants I had . Keep in mind that in my time , logos have completely taken over all of our clothing and objects . We stopped making plain shirts in the 2000 's , and the big companies managed to finally pass a law preventing us little people from making our own clothes - or anything else , for that matter . With my disassembled gun and a map of Austria , I set out to find my target . Immediately , I ran into a few hitches in my master plan of blindly time traveling here with a gun . I do n't know the language , I do n't know where my target is , and I 've never made a bullet in my life . All things that I probably could have learned in the time of The YouTube and The Google , but in my time , hackers had long since taken over the Internet and called it their own . So shortly after assembling the gun , I went to a time traveling station , one of the many locations made around the world for time travelers ( and only time travelers ) to return to their own time . My mission was a failure before I had even started , but it was n't like it was that big of a deal . I figured I would go back later when I was more equipped for the mission , like another trip to the grocery store . Now the problem is , I forgot to disassemble the gun . It did n't disappear , but rather stayed in the time period that I left , a diner that was to be the reverse time travel location in Austria . So when I traveled back , imagine my surprise when I found that the whole world was already owned by Hitler . His symbols , his face , and his evil permeated my once-peaceful world . Apparently , his grandchildren had taken over where he left off , after they took control with the use of a futuristic gun that was recreated in mass quantities after I left . Nobody knew how the weapons were obtained , but I knew . In shame , I used my last time travel , a portable disassembled in my bag . But in my hurry to get out of the time period that I had inadvertently built , I came to the year 2000 instead of 1800 . Now , 16 years after the last known time travel in history and time , I still tell my story to those who will keep fighting , hoping that the future that I destroyed can one day be repaired again .
`` Thank you . '' `` When time travel was first made practical , in 2178 , the first thing it was used for was to send a box of doughnuts back in time about four hours . The second thing it was used for was to kill a man whose very name has become a byword for evil - Adolf Hitler . Since then , the annual Kill Hitler Competition has brought death to this genocidal tyrant nearly a thousand times . He has been shot , stabbed , bludgeoned , poisoned , incinerated , drowned , blown up , strangled , and crushed . He has had his bones replaced with a nanotech skeleton at least a dozen times . He has been framed as a Jew . He has been genetically rewritten *into* a Jew . Several times he has been turned black . On one occasion , the entire Nazi leadership was sent further back in time and dropped right in front of invading Mongol hordes . On three separate occasions he has been eaten by dinosaurs . It is an honor to stand here before such an assembly of Hitler-killing heroes and fans . Heroes , it is your tireless efforts that , death by death , bring Adolf Hitler closer to justice . Fans , it is your dedication and support that allow us to keep doing this - to keep bringing this villain to justice . So , to both heroes and fans , I say thank you . I truly could not have pulled off this run without you . To explain why my run unfolded the way it did , I 'd like to start by talking about the scoring system . In this competition , points are awarded for creativity , difficulty , and justice . For instance , runs involving sending nuclear bombs back in time to blow up Hitler at a known place and time - along with the rest of the town - are , apart from the cost of the bomb itself , fairly easy to arrange , pretty straightforward to devise and execute , and pretty much guaranteed to kill more innocent people than Nazis . The nuke strategy has given us some of the lowest point scores in the history of the game . By contrast , high scoring approaches involve higher degrees of creativity , like redesigning buildings to ensure Hitler 's death , significant difficulty , like talking Hitler into killing himself , and justice - the more poetic the better - like last year 's winner , who abducted Hitler , starved and shaved him , and dropped him in a concentration camp to die by his own order . So , by raw facts , I did not kill Hitler . I did not directly plan Hitler 's demise . I did not even go back as far as when he was alive , let alone further . But I am here on points , because I understand the game . Instead of going directly to Hitler , I went back only about seventy years . in fact , I went to 2178 , to the Cheetos High Energy Physics lab . I walked in the door , ate a doughnut that had n't been cooked yet , and convinced Dr. Helmut Haire to travel back in time to kill Hitler . I watched him sacrifice his live in the attempt , and sent the recordings of his run - the first human time travel run , and the first run to try to kill Hitler - to the news media . I posted it on the CyberDugg , and on 23gag , and 90chan , and all of those old sites . I posted relentlessly , and still by the end of the week Dr. Haire was a hero . A celebrity martyr who had recognized the significance of his invention and used it to try to destroy the most evil man in recent memory . Once the image was set firmly in the public consciousness , I used the knowledge of business deals that had n't happened yet and political secrets that had n't yet come to light to fund and to clear obstacles from in front of the true meat of my plan . I set into motion a plan to kill Hitler not once , but again and again , bringing him to justice in new and creative ways . Heroes and fans , allow me to introduce myself in a new way . I am not only the winner of this year 's Kill Hitler prize . You also know me as Gunther O. Schnapp , the founder of the Kill Hitler Competition . Thank you . For everything . ''
The Hitler Games have been a huge hit when it became public in the 24th century . Sure , in the past people did it just for fun . Then came the betting of `` Hey , betcha I can kill Hitler better than you . '' People put hundreds , then thousands of dollars to try and one-up each other on this simple task . The end result was the same all around : Hitler dead , Allies win World War 2 . Some people did n't have the right imagination for this , so they started to have stand-ins for themselves . People who have entire lives dedicated to killing one man over and over . Started calling themselves the Anti-Gestapo out of sheer irony . It was only a matter of time until the Global Television Network played a couple of the more popular videos on their news networks and from there it became cemented in our culture . Eventually people started to get in each other 's way when setting up traps , or bringing down objects at the same time as each other . That 's when the first Time Travel War actually happened , during World War 2 of all places . And over Hitler . It 's amazing how stupid and greedy people can get . Laws were passed and then the first Hitler Games came to be . People had to try out for their nation to enter . Then whoever won the Hitler Games won a substantial amount of money , fame for their country , and the most important part , however they killed him became the true history . You see , time loves to stay in a straight line . Always heading in one direction . You can pick your starting point on the line , but your always going forwards . If there is a contradiction between what everyone knows as the past and you changing that , time just ignores that little inconsistency and it becomes a small footnote in time . The Grandfather Paradox was proven wrong by the first time traveler , no doubt . An eccentric man by the name of Viktor Odell wrote theories proving this paradox wrong but was always ignored by his fellow colleagues . So he invented it , went back and killed his grandfather . Came back with a signed photo from his grandmother with him standing next to the body . He was quickly put away , but was released due to the statute of limitations has passed . Viktor patented the time machine and soon everyone was killing and raping in the past . Then came the *second* Time Travel War . Yes , it happens in that order . So for the past couple of years Germany has won the Hitler Games . Cheating bastards always had the upper hand . But last year , someone from a different nation won : me from Canada . How 'd I win ? Well , everyone loves the big explosion , the last gasp . I went a different route . At first I made Hitler strong , made him win a few battles . Give him confidence in his nation 's strength and in himself . Think he literally can take on the whole world . Then , I took everything away . Big losses in the war , one after another . But I still kept him alive . If there were other nation 's assassins out to get him , I stopped those guys and made him feel the despair of being on top and falling straight to the bottom . Soon , Hitler was left with only one option : Killing himself . It 's very easy to kill one man . It 's very hard to convince one man to kill himself .
You lucky kids live in my resulting timeline . Where I made sure he killed himself , in a bunker , afraid , in total shame . He thought he 'd killed me , but I 'd already planted a techworm . It *whispered* the atrocious crimes he would commit , and made him live them every night . You know why I 'm ranked the best ? Because in the timeline I turned up the torture on him just in time that the bastard did n't make it nearly as far with his destruction and hate , and it was timed so well America comes out on top of the whole god damn world . Consider your country blessed .
`` Crow , you really did it now did n't you ? What 'd you do ? What . The . Fuck did you do . '' Whenever there 's a time paradox loop shitstorm , variations of myself have a habit of coming out of the alternate dimensional woodwork . Instability in the Tachyon field or a Cherenkov regulator could spell disaster for small parts of multiple universes . The last time there was a warning from the future of this magnitude , it was when I first got the kinks worked out with time travel . Apparently enough versions of me tried to go to Egypt around 49 BCE which caused an event that can be described in laymans terms as `` DDOSing a channel of communication in the universe '' . Undoing that damage is not easy and not necessarily possible . Another risk is a causality event becomes a point of interest to any alien civilizations that have enough ears in their local galaxy . A red haired man from an alternate universe in plaid that could pass off as my twin gave me an eye roll and a look of exhaustion . `` Relax Chief , this is a temporal staycation '' he says while rubbing his eyes . `` What f ... '' `` To kill Hitler and yes , we ran some paradox tests at Facility 3120 . We 're the first ones on this and warn others not to do it because of the inherent paradox . They back off when they realize the ramifications . What we do n't tell them is that we 're proceeding with it . '' `` You clever red headed fucker . How are we doing this , '' I reply as the smirk of a smart ass darts across both our faces . It 's a bit odd dealing with someone who knows with high probability exactly what you 're going to say but sometimes it can be comforting . Over gin he describes through coordination and supply of local resistance forces at the right time , we can take over a V2 rocket platform without firing a shot . At first this sounds insane as they 're typically well defended . Historical documents are a treasure trove of information for a time traveler , especially signatures . The Red Head hands me over a dossier to look through , mainly for my own curiousity . This event has in sense already happened or is determined to happen in the future , otherwise we would n't be talking after having been destroyed in an interdimensional pothole . I thumb through the dossier and see movement orders , maps , timetables , and a large event for a few top German brass including Shitler himself . `` A full staff of loyal resistance at a rocket facility ? That 's pretty ballsy considering the chance that all it takes is one you 're not sure about . '' `` Not quite , '' the red head replied , `` the original staff is moved to a resort facility and the higher true believer brass to a propaganda event on German soil . Their replacements are ghosts . They only exist on paper and through fake comm chatter in case a Wehrmact soldier gets a little too nosy . If they check the paper records , they 're there . If they call the base , they 're there . If they physically check the base , well , local resistance should be in and out before they 'd ever realize what 's going on and they 're more than adequately supplied considering the base overlooked our forged request to store an extra fully fueled V2 upright in a shack near the maingate . '' `` So you 're going to kill Hitler with one of his own V2s ? '' `` Oh it gets better , '' he said with a smile on his face . Taking another look at the dossier , a few documents stick out . The troop movements , rocket , and fuel supply orders are all signed by Hitler himself and threaten harsh punishments for questioning him . This is the same date with diary entries from his doctor which show he was incapacitated and trying to rest for an event the following day labeled as `` Sieg Durch Stärke '' . `` We figured why not make it look like Hitler ended up killing himself in this dimension too . '' He hands me one last dossier to look at . The mission was a success both in execution and in morale amongst the Allies . A different , clearer photo of the V2 is in here but with a slight twist . The rocket is painted with a Star of David , a pink triangle , and מכבי both as a reward to the saboteurs and for Psy Ops . Faking the orders created the Achilles ' heal and the V2 sliced it . A photo of a crater where Hitler , coordinators of death camps , and the SS is that dimension 's recording of when the Reich fell and from the European soil freedom slowly grew back . Having Hitler get offed by homosexuals really stirred some shit back in the US but they learned to swallow the truth before the 50 's , at least that was progress . Turing was indirectly spared from a society afraid of his sexual orientation . Later he would continue to develop crypto , help lead the world into the digital era , and marry a German biologist he 'd later meet at a conference in Vienna . `` This made my day , it ca n't possibly get any better . '' Reality catches up with my tongue as a Tachyon field opens and one of the most beautiful women I 've ever seen emerges . She looks oddly familiar but out of place with the events that unfolded . The confusion is pretty common amongst time traveling circles unfortunately , muddles up the whole works . `` Crow-137 , meet your future wife . Emma Lazarus . '' My jaw drops and my head feels as though it has no mass . `` This is amazing but there is still going to be conflict in the Middle East with Israelis and their neighbors . I love the concept of a Kibbutz and their pioneer attitude but then somewhere she goes off course and we have settlers acting as antagonists '' . `` Actually , not in this one . You know the Mason-Dixon line ? '' `` Yeah , '' I answer slightly confused . `` They found Israel as the 51st state in the Continental US and expand southward . ''
Last year 's Hitler killing was crazy , I ca n't believe I won ! Most people won simply by killing Hitler using the wackiest or most creative method they could conjure in their sick , twisted minds ... Some say I went a little too far , having no care for myself or for general human feelings during the whole process , but it was for the competition ! So the first step , I used our modern gender swapping machine , I figured that any amount of time would do , but just to be safe I set a decent amount of time , ehh ... sixteen years ? It was a long time to most people , but hell , we were time travelers , we do n't give a damn about time ! Anyways , I went back in time , admiring my new slender , curvy body , assuming the guise of a woman was n't exactly something I was used to , having done it only a few other times in the past . There was one thing I just could not get used to ... those damned women 's shoes . How the hell do they walk in those things ? Stumbling about , I managed to get to Adolf 's location just in time . He was in my sights ! As I was walking towards him , trying to give off as much womanly appeal as possible , a thought struck my mind , I had n't even come up with a name yet ! I stumbled for words as the future Fuhrer stared right at me , clearly stricken by my looks . He walked towards me , my lips still quivering for words , what should I say , what should I say ? ! ? ! ! `` May I get your name ... ? '' He muttered in a very fluent German , it was hard to recognize him at a young age knowing that iconic image , but it was him alright . Without thinking , I reached out my hand , grabbing his and shaking it , which was ... Uncommon , to say the least , among women , muttering a name that just came off the top of my head ... `` Eva Braun ! '' I shouted ...
`` No , Adolf . Your perspective is all wonky . Come , report to me after class and we 'll go over this together . But I see you 're improving with colors . That contrast here , that 's something pretty good . '' `` Yes , miss Radina . Thank you . '' I masked my smirk with what looked like a kind smile . Having 500 years of a head start in art , and having mastered domains not even known to the people of 1900 's was an advantage that gave me an edge over all artists of that time , and made all my students appear as geniuses to the art world of their contemporaries , and while this one was far from brilliant , I 'd be damned if I did n't make him one fine painter . -- - A trowel in one hand , a small bucket of fresh concrete in the other , I climbed the planks and makeshift stairs of the new construction site . I found the wall the workers had just finished making the day before . Nobody would notice the segment of the wall that grew by another two layers of bricks by morning . And nobody would discover the small package in a hollowed out brick I placed on the edge of a ventilation duct , its side easy to slide out as a drawer . That was to be the flat my dear Adolf will buy in five years , once he makes a name for himself . -- - `` Comrade Hitler ! It 's been an honor . Comrade Stalin has one of your paintings in his own office . Please , do n't be bothered by what 's going on in the streets . You and your family are under my protection . The war affects us all , and I apologize if my soldiers appear to be ... uncouth . Simple Saldats , they are hungry and tired after the march on Berlin and the fights have been quite violent . Anyway , we 've heard of your concepts of `` natonal socialism '' , and they are n't really incompatible with the ideology of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics , so I believe you will find yourself in the new reality quite at home . '' -- -- `` KGB , who 's talking ? '' `` This is Joseph Schmidt , and I have to report a citizen storing illegal assets . '' `` Is that so ? Please , report . '' `` Comrade Adolf Hitler , LeninStrasse 15 , third floor , has undeclared dollars and gold hidden in a hollowed out brick , inside the ventilation duct in the bathroom . '' `` THAT Adolf Hitler ? '' `` Yes , the very same . I 'm a chimney sweeper , and I was inspecting the ducts . The brick was slightly loose , so I had to check if there 's no risk of leak of smoke , and it appeared to be a hidden drawer . I just peered in and saw the dollars , but I did n't touch anything . '' `` If this is true , comrade Schmidt , then you can surely expect gratitude of the state . '' -- - > Today , Adolf Hitler , touted by many the greatest painter of 20th Century , but revealed to be an imperialist spy and traitor of the Soviet Union , died from pneumonia in a gulag in northern Siberia .
I can see him in the crowed . His jet black hair shining in the sunlight . I must have done this so many times before but , this time it 's different . I won last year by killing him with his own paint but , Killing a child ? I must be crazy . Does this make me just as bad as the monster before me ? I held my breath . His parents looked away long enough as I walked by them and grabbed his hand . `` who are you ? '' He asked so innocently I could see the confusion on his face as I walked a little faster with him . `` I 'm a friend of your mommy . Do n't you remember me ? '' He smiled and took my answer as trust . I remember the tattoo on my great grandmother 's arm . The pain and suffering . Watching the rest of her family starve to death or die in that awful chamber . I was going through with this . He is a man and a monster . He has to be stopped before it happens again . We are far enough away now . The stream was a little cold but not enough to freeze my hands . I did n't realize how much fight a child had in them . I watched the whole time though as the life drained from his eyes . I saw innocence die that day . I do n't regret it . They will find him at least . And they will have closure .
I went a diff direction cause I 'm high : / But might be cool ! The IDEA ( Inter-Dimensional Explorers Alliance ) holds an annual dimensional travelers championship . The IDEAS Cup ( the S stands for `` Showdown '' ) is the definitive time-sport championship . Participants sent into the past , full consciousness , experience an exact replica timeline split from the main timeline ( Pursuant to Chronolaw Article C:2676 ) resulting from the in-fractional displacement of tachyon particles . The IDEAS Council of the Multi-Dimension Combine ( MDC ) is pleased to announce the theme of this years IDEAS Cup ! The theme of the cup this year is , `` Hitler Hits ! '' and is one of our most `` influential '' contests to date . Adolf Hitler was a tyrannical leader of a planet in galaxy ZZ Plural Z Alpha sometime during the 9th Epoch of that universe . Under his rule 15 % of the planets population were retired . The theme of this year 's games is '' Hitlers Suicide ! '' Here are the rules : 1.Participants must kill Adolf Hitler using subterfuge , cunning , guile , and tact . 2 . Adolf Hitler must take his own life , and you can not kill anyone . 3 . You will be the lone operative of the game in the timeline you split . 4 . You may only change roles every 24Rh . ( 24 Relative-hours ) That 's all you need to know for this IDEAS Cup !
Time , as it turns out , is interesting . Certain things can change here and there but major events that change the course of history can not be changed . Hitlers death is one of them . The end of WWII is marked by the death of hitler and even changing his time of death by a day means changing that course . How then do you kill hitler as part of a competition ? Well , Hitler has to die on April 30th , 1945 . Time is a bit fuzzy too , old changes that have never happened in this timeline can sometimes bleed into the next . Some of you will remember the book Berenstain Bears while others of you will remember them a the Berenstein Bears books . That was us , sorry . Anything bigger than that and we 'll fix it but minor stuff is n't worth the hassle . Now that you know a little about how time works , some of you will think that hitler died by a gunshot , some will think that he died by cyanid , some by setting himself on fire , and some a combination of some or all of them . The most believed thought is that he died by Cyanide . We 've been at this for a little while now and that 's why there 's a little time bleed with people 's memories . The competition allows you to take Hitler out of the time stream and kill him somewhere else using any number of methods , but the result has to be that Hitler dies on April 30th , 1945 , or it has to seem that way anyway . You have to remember that eyewitness accounts are scarce and unreliable ( by design ) and DNA testing is not available until the 1990 's so as long as you wind up with two burnt bodies in the garden behind the Reich Chancellery . My name is Farthel Loid but you may know me as Adolf and I 'm the current ( an last ) reigning champion . You see , after I had poisoned Eva and just before I was to shoot myself a man appeared in full uniform in my living quarters . He was a slightly taller than average aryan man , dressed in my best uniform , and saluting . I attempted to shoot him but either my gun had malfunctioned or the bullets had no effect , his response was a loud `` SEIG HEIL ! '' . My shouting for guards also proved fruitless and then I could no longer move . He sat in the chair next to me . He told me of the events after what he called World War 2 and how there was a movement dedicated to my ideals after my death called neo nazis . He told me that many hundreds of years into the future they had learned of a competition to go back in time and kill ... me ... on the exact same day and are rated on a number of different scales for a point system . My jaw would have dropped at much of what he said if I could move . He said he joined the games after decades and decades of preparation , by duplicating his life with another so that the background check would clear ( for obvious reasons ) . This was done in incredible secrecy as any time travel changes are monitored and logged by a group outside of time . Lastly , he told me how all this was done for me . So that I could live on . That he would take my place . And that this was the last of the games as he and his group saw to it . He unfroze me and said I had two options . The first was to shoot him but then I would be dead by gunshot before my valet entered the room . The second was for him to take my place . I opted for the second choice . We exchanged coats , he sat in my place on the lounge and instructed me to push a button on the coat which would signal my retrieval . After doing so I saw him shoot himself in the head so he was unrecognisable . I appeared before a group of aryan men and women in uniform , far larger than the army I had assembled in Germany . I appeared in the third reich .
Every year , twelve people are chosen at random to participate in the `` Hitler Death Games '' . You get the scenario projected into AEther along with your consciousness . Your body stays in a , sort of `` limbo '' . Everyone and everything in the AEther is a projection , except yourself . A person 's consciousness can be killed within the AEther , so the risk of the game is real . The previous year 's winner , Pat Salamander , killed Adolph Hitler in one of the most talked about `` Hitler Deaths '' in decades . The video went viral almost instantly and some instances of it on YouTube have views in the 8 digits . Pat had a partner in this , but no one ever talks about Robert . Pat 's second cousin , Robert helped him every step of the way . Robert actually killed more SS officers during their adventure than Pat did , but neither of them were counting . Pat , armed with an MP40 , followed Robert into Hitler 's house . Once inside , they spent a moment looking at the beautiful fixtures mounted on the walls with swastika flags and pendants placed here and there . Beauty mixed with evil . They two quietly walked across the large den area , toward the bedroom . Hitler slapped Eva Brown 's round , bare ass , causing her to let out an , `` eek ! '' as she hopped in the shower . He looked at himself in the steamy mirror with a serious face . He jokingly makes a farting sound and smiles before getting in with Eva . Robert and Pat make their way through the master bedroom . Pat looked on the ground and saw leather with zippers , whips and a ball gag . Robert said , `` They 're in the shower . This is it , man . '' Pat took a few steps past the bed to look on the floor . He saw a series of butt plugs and anal beads laying next to the leather mask on the floor . `` Dude , check this out . '' Pat opens the camcorder and starts videoing the weird collection on the floor . Robert ignored that and said , `` Come on , man . We got ta get him before they get out . '' Pat points the camera toward Robert and shows him pulling a chainsaw out of a backpack . Pat laughed , `` Oh man , this is going to be the best one ever ! '' `` Here we go buddy ... '' Robert pulls the cord and starts the chainsaw . Both Hitler and Eva could hear it from the shower . Robert kicks the door in and steps inside the bathroom . `` Ready to die , fucker ! ? '' He stepped closer to the shower , but slipped on the rug and fell to a sitting position , with the saw landing on his abdomen . Robert screamed as the saw cut through his torso , ripping through the flesh like teeth . Blood streamed across the sliding glass door as Hitler slid it open to see the horror . All three of them stood there in shock , watching Robert seizure on the floor with a running chainsaw still spraying blood . Pat came to his senses and pointed the MP40 at them with one hand while videoing them with the other . Hitler held his hands in front of his genitals as he and Eva started shouting in German , but Pat shot five rounds into the ceiling above them . They 're quiet after that . `` Put your hands up , now ! '' They raised their hands above their heads . Just then , a moment before Pat would 've shot him , he noticed Hitler did n't have a penis . In fact , there was a very prominent bush with a vagina between his legs ! Pat could n't help himself from yelling , `` Are you fucking kidding me ? What ? ! '' Hitler immediately covered it up and started shouting again , but stopped when he noticed Pat staring at his hands . Pat was , on one hand , still shocked and devastated by his cousins grizzly death , however , he was amazed that the most hated tyrant of all time had a vagina . He composed himself and motioned for them to raise their hands again . He zoomed the video in on Hitler 's vagina . As Pat pointed the gun at Hitler 's face , he started to think about how he 's going to end this . No matter what happens , it does n't change history , so Pat had an open opportunity to do what he wanted . The terrible dictator was reduced to a blubbering fool , writhing around in his tears and vomit . Pat had a plan . Pat hit them with the MP40 , broke both their wrists and told them to go outside and get in the pool . It was mid-October and , in Germany , it gets really cold in October . The couple slowly walked into the freezing water , shaking uncontrollably . Pat stood at the back entrance of the garage , pointing the gun at them . `` All the way ! '' he shouted as he set his camera down and checked the frame . Perfect . Adolph and Eva swam out to the deep end and started treading water . Pat lit a cigarette . `` Was machen Sie ? Lassen Sie uns hier raus ! '' shouted Hitler . Eva noticed the fuel pump in Pat 's hand . `` Er wird uns lebendig zu verbrennen ! '' yelled Eva . Pat activated the nozzle of the gas pump and laid it on the ground . Gas poured onto the cobblestone , streaming across into the pool . Hitler and Eva swam toward the edge but could n't get out because of their broken wrists . He called over to them and said , `` I only know one thing in German . So long , farewell , auf wiedersehen , goodbye . '' Pat tossed his cigarette into the pool as he turned around and walked away . He collected the camera and activated the portal to return home . Pat 's scrambled atoms lunged forward through spacetime faster than lightspeed and emerged back into his body . Once his brain had been `` recalibrated '' , he was greeted as the winner of that year 's Hitler Death . There were news crews around , along with his family and friends . Marissa , Robert 's girlfriend , stood in the front of the crowd eagerly waiting for Robert 's body to come alive . Pat gave her a sad look . A look that said everything . Marissa closed her eyes , shed a single tear , ad turned away , disappearing into the crowd forever . Pat was raised up into the air by everyone , cheering his name and playing celebration music . Confetti rained down as children ran around playing between the adults , whose eyes were fixed on Pat . President Trump made a small speech about how he loves watching Hitler die , because Hitler tried to make America less great , and that 's the opposite of what he 's about . A small child jumped on stage in excitement , but Trump 's Secret Service Sentinels intercepted him and took him backstage . Trump went on about how children love him and how he 's been sponsoring each year 's games with a lot of money . A lot . Like , more than any other single person has . `` Pat , it 's an honor to have you on this stage , standing next to great men , like myself . This year 's winning Hitler Death is on of the best I 've ever seen ! I mean , really . It 's something to behold . Of course , we got to see the ending ! '' The massive crowd roared ! `` Let 's show him the finale he created ! '' A giant screen started playing the footage . Pat saw himself on the 100 foot screen , but thought about losing Robert in his journey . Nothing could bring Robert back . Pat started to wonder if these games are even worth the risk . `` ... auf wiedersehen , goodbye . '' He gave his attention to the screen and watched a burning , female Adolph Hitler crawl across the cobblestone , screaming in pain .
Time travel is a game and I realise that now but last year was my revelation . I remember before all these Hitler Trials I would work on my carpentry in my shed while my husband slaved over this DIY time machine kit . It took him a few years to get the machine user-friendly enough to meet council standards and by that time , time machines were becoming the common method of transportation . People made a sport out of it , a manhunt to an extent where everyone competing aimed to kill Hitler in the most difficult and creative way possible . My husband and I drafted this huge plan and put it in place at the beginning of last year . First of all , my husband and I decided to have a temporary marriage truce so I could effectively kill Hitler meaning we divorced and would remarry on my return . We went to the verification offices , took the tests , and I was probed in the eye so they could monitor my progress and verify the kill as well as the method . I entered our machine that was docked at the office and I travelled back in time before World War II . My goal was to get Hitler to fall in love with me and keep him out of the conflict until he was at his most vulnerable , ending up in his suicide . . . My name is Eva Braun and I have made a safe trip to Munich , Germany , October 1929 .
Rumour has it the whole idea for the Assassination Games started off as a drunk bet by Crichton and Brown in a bar . The story has is that after they had stumbled upon definitive proof of the multiverse theory while trying to create artificial wormholes , the pair had went out and got absolutely hammered to celebrate . At some point over the course of the night , Crichton started boasting about it , trying to impress one of the young undergrads at the bar by telling her how time travel was now basically possible , and he had just solved how to do it . She challenged him to prove it by doing something like going back and killing Hitler . Long story short , they ended up going back , and the undergrad decided she would make vines of the whole thing . The footage went viral , and ( after an *extremly* stern talking to by MIT 's ethics committee ) Crichton and Brown won a Nobel Prize . Yes , the greatest discovery of the century -and the solar system 's most popular televised event- came about because a scientist was trying to score . I could n't make this up if I tried . See , some universes in the multiverse are basically identical , except instead of being in 2156 , they might be in 1956 or 300BC , or before humans even evolved . And since there are an infinite amount of them , some bright shot got the idea of making a tournament out of going back in time to kill various historical figures . The winner would get a ludicrously large cash sum . While the first few contests were messy , primitive affairs , often ending with most of the contestants killing each other off , soon it evolved into something closer to it 's modern format . Each contestant got their own timestream , and points were awarded on difficulty , creativity , and `` non-target impact '' . That last term got written into the rules after some wiseass decided that he would try to take out Putin by setting off a nuke in the middle of Moscow . That timeline started a nuclear war after he pulled that , and the organisers decided that although yes he had killed Putin , he had also wiped out 99 % of the rest of the population too . After all , if they had let him get away with that , it would only have been a matter of time before another smartass decided to 'win ' by causing the Sun to supernova . No , the less people your actions kill outside of the target , the better . I had entered this year 's tournament , and got lucky in my bracket . First round was Lincoln , and I had won the public vote by a landslide after replacing Booth 's with a joke replica that fired a flag that said `` bang ! '' on it . While everyone in the audience was having a laugh at the 'joke ' attempt to kill the president , I blew up the entire playhouse . The people back home love mayhem and carnage , so even though the judges took points off for collateral damage , the fake pistol gag combined with the sheer level of destruction I caused got me the viewer 's choice . Round two had been Napoleon . Now most previous competitors chose to either knock him off while exiled in Elba , or use the confusion of a major battle to reach him . I decided on a bit of irony . Now , you may have heard of the Battle of Austerlitz . At one point during it , the French artillery had the bright idea to bombard the ice the Russian army was crossing , breaking it and causing them to drown along with equipment . Well , I jumped there , to before the battle . While Napoleon was surveying the battlefield , I hid in a nearby treeline and used a low power laser to heat the ice below him . The faces on his advisors when the ice he was standing on suddenly gave way and sent him into the water was priceless . The semi-finals had been set in the early 21st century this year . Each contestant got three targets to kill in a single timeframe . To make it easier for competitors , all three targets would be at one place at least once in the timeframe , but assassinating them seperately would get bonus points for difficulty . This year the lineup was David Cameron , Vladimir Putin , and Xi Jinping . I wo n't go into all the setup I had to go through to get it lined up perfectly , but on the same day -within a few minutes of each other- I managed to get themall . Putin was fatally mauled by a bear while on a hunting trip ( I had thought that had some more irony , seeing as the old history textbooks refer to Russia as a bear ) . Xi had appeared in public to condemn student protests against him , when a 'mysteriously loosened ' bolt caused an electronic screen with his own face to fall onto the stage , crushing him ( and unfortunately his security retinue ) . Cameron I dealt with personally ; he was touring the country and staying at a hotel I had 'conviently ' been hired at the week before . Let 's just say the media had a field day when they found out he was dead from what appeared to be auto-erotic asphyxiation , alone in a room with nothing but a pig 's head . For that I had taken inspiration from a supposed scandal that the British media had heard about him in our timeline , and made sure the tabloids would have a much more 'interesting ' story this time around . I managed to get through to the final , and myself and the other finallist were given this ear 's rules for Hitlerbowl XXXVI . Only weaponry or tech that would exist by the 1940 's , except our travel beacons ( and of course , nuclear weapons ) . Collateral damage would be severely penalised , and as the added difficulty bonus , being able to have a conversation with goold ol ' Adolf before you knock him off . I had been trying for some historical irony in most of my previous matches , and the audience had been loving it ; I figured I would stick to the theme since I seemed good at it . I had been preparing for this in between previous matches , and could at this point speak German almost as good as a native . So , I set my destination to Berghof , to coincide with one of Hitler 's vacactions out of Berlin . Bluffing my way in as a domestic , I procured a uniform belonging to an SS officer . Then , with a bit of skill -and more luck than I 'd care to admit- I managed to knock out Hitler , kidnap him and smuggle him into the trunk of a staff car . From there , I drove for some hours until I was nearly at the city of Linz . Using my disguise as an SS officer , I stopped at a farmhouse , and demanded a set of civilian clothes and use of the barn from the terrified family . I kocked Hitler out again and dragged him into the barn , redressed him in civilian clothing , and used a straight razer to shave off his moustache and alter his hairstyle . After that , I fetched some ropes to tie him to a post , then waited until he woke . When he awoke , he seemed confused until he spotted me . He began yelling and cursing , demanding that as his Furhrer I release him . I let him rant for a while , then approached him and shoved a sock in his mouth . Leaning in close , I told him that I was going to kill him . The angry ranting started from behind the sock , but I covered his mouth with my palm and asked him if he knew of the SS 'base ' about ten miles out of Linz , and what exactly it was they did there at Mauthausen . His face told me all I needed to know . I went on to tell him that I was going to deliver him to the camp , and explain to the 'fine gentlemen ' there that I had caught a fugitive Jew hiding in the region and was bringing him to be interred , and how he was gonig to suffer the same fat as the millions he had condemmed to die in those camps across Europe . At that , the yelling and the struggling began again , so I knocked him out and bundled him into the car again , trussing him up so he could n't escape once he woke up . I arrived at the camp about an hour later , and continued through with my cover story about a fugitive Jew found in the nearby region while I was enjoying a vacation from the drudgery of Berlin . Hauling Hitler up , I undid his bonds and ungagged him . I explained how the man was touched in the head , trying to escape with the pathetically laughably excuse that he was actually the Fuhrer . When he started up , threatening to have us all executed for insubordiantion , the guard approached and smashed a rifle into his gut . I saw fear take over his eyes , and he struggled to his feet and began to try to run . The sentries ordered him to stop , but he did n't listen . So ... they shot him . This was where my plan went pear shaped . Originally , I had planned to have him end up being one of the many prisoners who ended up in the chambers ( the ultimate ironic death in my eyes ) , but instead there was Hitler , bleeding to death on a road in the middle of Austria . Sighing , I got in my car and began to drive off , running over the corpse ; half of the reason why was out of frustration , the other hoping I would make back some creativity points for it . In the end it did n't matter , however . My opponent failed in his attempt , which was some ridiculously convoluted plan involving an exploding pen and a book-signing . So I got back , and I did the whole winner 's tour , even got my $ 5 million prize . Applications for Hitlerbowel XXXXII are coming up soon though , and it might be nice to be the first person to win it twice . Man , would n't that be one for the history books .
Ever since the Council of Watchmen ( no , they do n't see why every new Chrono laughs at the name ) first discovered and stabilized the bubble-universes , there 's been a contest : who can kill Hitler the best ? Sure , it seems like a pointless game ; after all , the first to kill Hitler would be the only one who got to , right ? After all , any observed events are locked automatically , to prevent a breach of Rule 1 . Turns out , though , the bubble universes I talked about are weird . They are small splits in the main Yggdrasil corridor , little bubble universes accounting for slightly different properties of the period between 1941 and 1944 . In some , Anne Frank was never found , in others , Hitler successfully captured Moscow . And it 's in these pockets that we compete . We 're scored on everything from difficulty of our particular bubble , to creativity in the actual murder bit , to whether or not we were observed ( and believe it or not , unobserved is n't necessarily better ) . Some of the highlights of the early champions were the man who disguised himself as the corpse of Dietrich Bonhoeffer , the lady who talked Eva Braun into killing her boyfriend , and the man who put acid in Hitler 's shoes . When I finally got greenlighted to compete , I was thrilled . I 'd been planning this for a long time , and I knew I 'd score in the top 7 . I 'd been given the paranoid-and-in-a-bunker scenario , which was rated an 11 out of the possible 13 in terms of difficulty , and nobody expected me to succeed . How did I do it ? The records do n't do it justice . I took off all the landing precautions , landed in a branch of my bubble , around a fragmented Hitler . Then I led him into my actual scenario , and let him kill the other Hitler . Then I killed him too , for good measure . Had to burn the bodies , though . Would have been too many questions otherwise .
`` Look fuhrer , look here ! these people have made a writing prompt where killing you is a sport and the entire point is to be the most creative person who killed you ! '' I claim while pointing at the screen of my laptop , which I brought with me into the past . it 's amazing how you can connect to the internet of the future in the past just by bringing something from the future into the past , it 's a strange occurrence called `` temporal information bridging '' and is based on the idea that the universe is composed of information , so bringing something from one point in time does n't necessarily disconnect it from that point in time , in other words because there 's an internet signal in this specific location at some point in the future , bringing a laptop connected to that specific internet connection at that point in time into the past does n't terminate the connection . makes my head hurt just to think about it . `` so ... even now my enemies in the future who have demonized me continue trying to hunt me and doom me . '' the fuhrer clutched his head , and i could sense the existential anguish . `` to think all this time I would be immortalized as their private devil ! to think I could have done so poorly in my life that i am like the demons of hell ! you time traveler , you have confided in me when I needed you the most , when you first came to the past you protected me from these other time travelers , brought order back to the reich and killed these fools contending to slay me . now that too has become a running joke in some alternate timeline ! what a tragedy this life of mine is ! that I could become so trivial and hated that I can not even defend my image from the ravages of time ! '' he slammed his fist down on the laptop , breaking it before realizing his error and fuhreiously apologizing . `` what must I do to atone for this ? how can I bring myself from the hell I have coming to me ? ! '' `` furher . '' I began . `` you 're not to blame , you suffer from a disease , syphilis . '' `` yes , I recall you mentioning that ... but does that absolve me ? '' he asked angrily . `` No , it does n't absolve you I suppose , but you are n't entirely responsible for your actions either . '' i explained . `` you fight two enemies now , the time travelers and their future , and your own mind , ailing , breaking . you can repent for the crime of the holocaust , the people will still hate you of course , they 'll never pay attention to your redemption because the story of the wicked adolf hitler holds their hearts in far greater sway . but you can prevent yourself from doing the world any further harm . '' I hand him a gun . `` the japanese believe that death by suicide carries its own form of honor , that to act out of duty to that which you believe by taking your own life is a firmer statement than simply dying fighting for it . you regret the holocaust , you accept your illness and we both know there is no cure for your mind 's degraded state . you will only get worse from here , if you truly wish to redeem yourself ... ..well ... show the world by sacrificing your life for that redemption . '' `` will anything change ? '' hitler asked suspiciously . `` no , but good people , german and jewish , will be spared the madness of adolf hitler the villain , because adolf hitler the repentant man stood against his own mind , his worst nemesis , and defeated it for them . '' adolf turned the weapon over slowly before nodding to himself . `` very well then ... ..but do me a favor , yes ? '' `` what is it ? '' `` remember me for this ... remember that I redeemed myself and renounced my foolish , wicked actions ... .if the future hates me so be it , but please ... .remember this final moment . '' he put the gun to his temple , I stared impassively as the flash from the muzzle rang out , shattering his skull . with a sigh I returned to the future where the judges awaited me . `` amazing , simply amazing ! such a masterful manipulation of a man 's emotions ! ! you 're truly frightening ! ! '' they awarded me maximum points , and from there I decided to post this in the /r/ writing prompts of reddit on a return trip to my vacation home in the year 2016 , which happens to be the old fuhrer 's home . all in all it was n't that hard , driving a crazy man to suicide ? pff , easy . getting hitler to redeem himself by humbling him with visions of the future ? that shit was the hard part .
Thank you all so much ! I wasn ’ t sure I had a shot , but after reading all your comments , I really appreciate the compliments , especially from past winners . It wasn ’ t easy convincing Jesus to kill Hitler , but your kind words make spending all that vacation time worth it ! Last year , Janelle forwarded me on your email chain about the contest ─ reading Van Minh ’ s story about flooding the Fuhrerbunker with beer had me rolling on the floor laughing my ass off . I ’ m just glad I was at home ; I don ’ t think my coworkers would ’ ve appreciated it ( you excepted , Janelle ! ) Aside from wondering how in the world you find that much beer ( and transport it ! ) while the Russians are shelling Berlin , I was naturally wondering how the hell I could get involved and top you , Van Minh . I mean , here I am working for a history-acquisition NGO ; I don ’ t have the resources to rent a gate , let alone a private gate off Grand Central . When I started by paging through the runners-up , I thought I 'd be content to just daydream ─ until I hit on Charlie Wilkers ’ story of getting Stalin to kill Hitler . It was way down in the weeds ; you all thought it was a cop-out to use modern tech to transport and set up the “ Battle of the Moustaches , ” as he put it , but I thought Charlie had a pretty good idea . ( Charlie , I ’ m going to be at this year ’ s Parallels Conference in Grand Central ─ if you ’ re there , I owe you a drink ! ) Thing was , I had to figure out how to *trump* Charlie ’ s idea . I could n't just steal it , and like a lot of you , I wanted to restrict myself to *after* Hitler came to power . It 's never cool to kill an innocent Schicklgruber , right ? My first thought was to get someone like Gandhi to do the deed in the Fuhrerbunker . I mean , they ’ re both contemporaries ; his pacifism aside , it shouldn ’ t take much to convince him to pull a trigger against Hitler , right ? But as I was thinking about Gandhi , I started figuring how I could trump that . I mean , that ’ s the beauty of our fractal universe , right ? You dig deep enough , scan with enough precision , you can find a Parallel where time flows at just the right rate to get the person you want . Instead of Gandhi , why not George Washington ? What about Genghis Khan ? Hell , look to the recent past ─ get Boy George or Mother Theresa , John Paul II or Ringo Starr . Why not Jesus H. Christ himself ? That idea gave me the excited stomach-quivers when it hit me , and I just had to figure out how to make it happen . Once we won the UCLA contract to recover Louvain ’ s library , I thought I had a shot . I ’ m a modernist ─ I usually work from the 18th through the late 20th centuries ─ so the Louvain thing was a big deal for Palimpsest ( and thus me ! ) It was a hairy recovery , and I got a lot of comp vacation . That gave me the time , and once Sheri Young over at XCursions heard my plan , she volunteered her gate to let me try . ( I definitely owe you more than a drink , Sheri ! ) XCursions isn ’ t a fancy place ─ they don ’ t even have a drivable or walkable gate . It ’ s a straight foot-first shot , a tube blasting you through a portal as small as humanly possible , and I ’ d have to be back in two weeks . George Metrokin is Palimpsest ’ s guide to the Biblical Levant ─ you might know him from one of those National Geographic specials about searching for “ the real ” Jesus ─ and he came along for the ride . He was as tickled with the idea as I was , and he volunteered to go . That was a good thing , since I don ’ t speak Aramaic naturally ; I had to rely on a translator earpiece and makee-lookee dumb show to get along otherwise . Now , if you ’ re thinking this whole idea is sacrilegious , you might be right ─ but this guy wasn ’ t “ our ” Jesus . I mean , how many Jesus specials have you seen ? There ’ s a literally infinite number of universes out there , and I mean , we ’ ve seen fiery preacher Jesuses , we ’ ve seen humble angelic-looking guys , we ’ ve seen female Jesuses , Asian Jesuses , fighting Jesuses , pacifist Jesuses … One of the jokes at Palimpsest is that there ’ s never a shortage of funding for efforts to go find “ the real ” Jesus . The Levant at the start of the first millennium is practically the best-explored thing in the multiverse aside from all the knuckleheads going to visit ( and be disappointed by ) the “ library ” of Alexandria . Anyway , we spent a week walking ( and riding ) around Israel ─ yeah , I know it ’ s anachronistic to call it that , but who cares ? ─ before we found the guy , doing his normal hillside preaching thing . We played our part hard and fast , as astrologers/mystics from far away who ’ d heard about Jesus and his preaching and were hoping he could help us with a little problem we had . Our Jesus was a pretty gullible guy ─ he must ’ ve been drinking his own Kool-Aid and actually listening to himself preach ─ and so he was happy to help the “ noble foreigners ” with their problem . It helped that we convinced him that Hitler was killing Jews in his home country ( see kids , a little truth never hurt anyone ) . We tried teaching Jesus to shoot ─ and wasn ’ t that a hoot ! He couldn ’ t aim worth a damn , so we decided to switch to a backup plan and give him a flamethrower instead . This was one of those World War II models , with a backpack , hand lever and point-and-click action . He had a whale of a time with it practicing in the desert before our pickup gate opened . Sheri had us picked up and ready to de-port to the Fuhrerbunker before Jesus got hit by culture shock too bad . One of the things I picked up from notes left by you guys and gals is that the Fuhrerbunker tends to get smoky or filled with fumes pretty darn quick , so we all wore SCBAs to ward off the smoke . It never ceases to amaze me how quick pre-industrial folks pick up on modern tech . I mean , we design it to be user-friendly , but it just goes to show that the stuff works even if you don ’ t know how it works . Anyway , we came out of the gate with guns ( and flamethrower ) blazing . The hard part was actually keeping Jesus from getting too enthusiastic with the damn flamethrower . He almost fried us a few times , until we turned it down almost to a candle-flame . George and I kept down covering fire to protect Jesus ( and that was another hoot ─ playing Secret Service for Jesus ! ) The whole thing took about two and a half months to plan , two and a half weeks to arrange , then two and a half minutes to actually happen . I ’ ve linked the Go-Pro footage for you if you want ( it ’ s damn gory stuff ) , and we got Hitler with his dog and most of the SS higher-ups , too . After it was all over , we dropped Jesus back off in his home Parallel , and George and I got back home . It was Jesus in the bunker with the flamethrower , and that ’ s a winning strategy !
So get a load of this . I had this idea . I was thinking , how am I going to kill one of the most antagonistic political figures of the 20th century ? I thought , hey , a sperm whale -- - It started with a sperm whale anyway . I was just going to drop a *sperm whale* on him . Then I realized , I was n't going to get points just for subtelty or difficulty . *Anyone* can drop something on someone . Hell , the third winner used an ambulance . Points for creativity *and* irony that year . Then , I figured it out . An *homage* to the old days of this noble sport . So I went back to a further time , earlier in the era . Found this old man , and asked him what he thought of some paintings I brought with me . Here 's where we pick up the pace . I asked him about *Adolf Hitler's* paintings . He thought out loud as old men always do ( even in the 20th century ! ) and said , he never heard of him , but the painting technique was `` disappointing . '' Then I asked him to repeat himself , and say , `` Adolf Hitler 's art , was disappointing . '' So he did . I asked him to *yell* it , tell all who would hear a master 's opinion of this work . *JUST* as he was about to respond , I teleport him over Hitler making a public speech in Berlin three decades later . You can see this old man *zooming* down into the sky . In the tape , you can barely see Hitler raise his eyebrows . *That's* when he realizes someone was yelling his name from above . You have no idea how difficult it was calculating the *exact* velocity to get the old man 's adrenaline going , give him time to speak , and have Hitler hear him . And there ! That 's how I pulled it off . I killed Adolf Hitler by dropping his painting idol , Rudolf von Alt , far above his head , *while* he was yelling out his opinion of Hitler 's paintings for all of Berlin to hear . It was the last thing he ever heard . And Rudolf called his paintings *crap ! * The bonus points for intricacy *and* emotional devastation got me the victory . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- *More at r/galokot , and thanks for reading ! * * [ Art ] ( http : //i.imgur.com/9v5ELxa.jpg ) by /u/BierWiser*
Today we interview last year 's Hitler Hunt winner , Eric Brdinie , who got his kill by piloting a nanobot in a 'blitzkrieg ' on Hitler 's nervous system . Careful testing by judges revealed that Eric killed Hitler a fraction of a second before the bullet . Testing also revealed that the timeline created by Eric 's kill is indistinguishable from Timeline Zero , an unprecedented feat and proof of concept . **First of all , good luck on Hitler Hunt 2036 . ** Thanks . **Maybe just as background for those who might not know it , how did you come up with your idea for last year 's kill ? ** Well first of all , I 'm a graduate student at CMU and I work in a lab that focuses on nano telematics and piloting . Obviously Hitler Hunt is a big deal and while I was watching the kills three years ago , you know , I was just starting at my lab and I got this idea to use the systems I work on . **What was the most difficult thing about what you did ? ** Definitely it was figuring out where to hide all of the equipment I needed to set up to pilot the bots . All in all I needed like 3 cubic meters of space for the batteries , the piloting harness , the launchpad , and radios . I needed a full cubic meter just for the batteries because you know , there 's no way you can get power back then right there . The Fuhrerbunker is small and just jampacked with people . I spent a lot of time trying to figure out if I could set up there , talked to a lot of past Hitler Hunters about it . At the end of the day I just realized it was impossible so I started looking outside of the Fuhrerbunker and investigating how to increase the range for my transmitter . At the same time , the Reich Chancellery is far from deserted and basically everywhere I looked there was a chance of being discovered and branching the timeline . I eventually figured out a series of rooms I could rotate between in order not to get caught but the timing was super intricate and I really had to have my gear together and not leave anything incriminating behind . So that was the hardest thing - had to get the timing and the movements flawless . **Did you worry that the judges would not appreciate the subtlety of your kill ? ** Yeah you know I get that a lot . Some people still are n't impressed by it . [ laughs ] I guess the gory deaths are the real crowd-pleasers . But you know I had to submit my plan-of-attack to the judging committee for approval and when I went in for the presentation it was pretty clear to me that they understood how unique and how tough my plan was . I mean , there were a lot of things that had to break just-right in order to get this to work . Like the other thing I spent a lot of time on was how to kill Adolf , and in demonstrable way , but still have him go through the motions of the suicide . So lots of studying ways to kill with a single nanobot but as instantaneously as possible and not disrupt his arm holding the gun . **Can you give us any hints about your plan this year ? ** Well I 'm afraid it 's not going to be super-different from last year . It 's a nanobot again . I 'm piloting it again . I 'm still going to be in the Chancellery . But I can give you the twist . Instead of a separate timeline indistinguishable from Timeline Zero , if I manage to pull this off , *it will still be Timeline Zero* .
I studied all the film footage I could to find the best place to catch him off guard . I filled a syringe with enough poison to kill an elephant . Then I traveled back to a time where he would speak and then walk out into the crowd . I knew the very place I needed to stand . It seemed like slow motion as I watched him come into view . Then it happened . Indiana Jones bumped into him ans during that moment of confusion , I plunged that needle so deep into Hitlers neck . It was exhilarating to see his face contort and Jones ' bewildered look as Hitler fell to the ground . I escaped just in time . If the movie has changed , it is a small price to pay .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods . First , I used a time machine to travel back to the exact moment Hitler was giving a speech in the bunker . As soon as he began speaking , I used a powerful laser to cut through the wall of the bunker and shoot him in the head . The second part of my plan was to use a time machine to travel back to the moment before Hitler was born . I then used a powerful force field to prevent his mother from giving birth to him . This ensured that Hitler would never exist in the first place . My plan worked perfectly and I was able to kill Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . This earned me the championship title and the admiration of all the other time travelers .

Last year , I won the championship by taking a very creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler .

I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the party , so that they would spread it to the rest of the party . Next , I visited the offices of the German President , Paul von Hindenburg , and spread rumors that Hitler was a dangerous and unstable man who should not be trusted with power . I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the government , so that they would spread it to the rest of the government . Finally , I visited the homes of important people in the Nazi party and government and planted evidence that Hitler was a fraud and a con artist . I also planted evidence that he was a coward and a weak leader . These subtle tactics worked and Hitler never gained the power he wanted . I was able to win the championship by using a creative and difficult approach that did n't drastically alter the timeline .

I won last year 's `` Killing Hitler '' championship by taking a very creative and difficult approach . Instead of going back in time and killing Hitler directly , I decided to go back to the 1920s and alter the course of history . I first set out to make sure that Hitler never rose to power in the first place . I started by making sure that his early political career was unsuccessful . I spread rumors and false information about him , sabotaged his speeches , and worked to discredit him in the eyes of the public . I also worked to make sure that he never gained enough support to form the Nazi party . My next step was to make sure that the conditions which allowed Hitler to come to power were never created . I worked to make sure that the Treaty of Versailles was never signed , and that the German economy was never destabilized . I also worked to make sure that the German people were never oppressed , and that their rights were always respected . Finally , I worked to make sure that Hitler was never able to lead an army . I spread false information about him , and worked to make sure that he never gained the trust of the German people . I also made sure that he never had access to the resources and manpower necessary to form an army . In the end , my efforts were successful and Hitler was never able to come to power . I won the championship by successfully preventing Hitler from ever rising to power in the first place .

I won last year 's championship by traveling back to the year 1939 , when Hitler was preparing to launch World War II . I crafted a plan that was both creative and difficult . First , I sought out the man who was responsible for delivering the orders for Hitler 's troops to mobilize .

Next , I went directly to Hitler 's residence and , using a combination of my wits and charm , I convinced him to stay at home instead of leading the troops . With Hitler out of the way , I was able to ensure that the false orders were followed and the war never began . My plan was a success and I was crowned the champion of the Time Travelers Killing Hitler competition . It was an unforgettable experience and one that I will never forget .

I won last year 's time travel competition by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan for killing Hitler . My plan was to send him a letter from the future , warning him of his impending death . The letter was written by a mysterious time traveler from the future , who claimed to have come back to warn Hitler of his impending death . The letter warned him that he had only a few days to live , and that he should take the necessary precautions to prepare for his own demise . The letter was sent to Hitler 's personal residence , and was delivered by a trusted messenger . It gave Hitler the perfect opportunity to flee or take the necessary precautions to protect himself . However , he chose to ignore the warning , thinking it was a hoax . Unfortunately for Hitler , the letter was not a hoax . Three days after receiving it , Hitler was killed in a surprise attack on his bunker . He was caught completely off-guard , and unable to take the necessary steps to protect himself . My plan ended up being the most creative and difficult way to kill Hitler , and I was awarded the championship for my ingenuity .
The city was beautiful and full of life , but it was also full of secrets . People of all kinds and backgrounds lived here , but they all had one thing in common - they all had some kind of special power . Telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , shapeshifters , and so much more . It seemed like everyone had a unique power that was unlike any other . But there was something else that was unique about the city - the ranking system . Everyone was ranked according to their power level . The higher your power , the higher your rank . I was the highest rank there was : rank # 1 . But no one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret , never revealing it to anyone . The truth was that I had the ability to absorb the powers of anyone I killed . If I killed someone of a higher rank , I could take their power and add it to my own . It was a dangerous game , but one I had to play . I had to stay at the top of the rankings in order to protect myself and the city . I had no idea how long I could keep this up . But I was determined to do whatever was necessary to protect the city and its people . Even if it meant taking the life of someone with a higher rank .
At first , I did n't know what to do with the happiness . I had never felt it before , and it felt strange and foreign .

I started to experiment with the happiness , finding ways to use it , and how it could help me cope with the world around me . I found that I could use it to bring joy to others , to help me see the good in people , to make me feel more confident and to make me more patient . I also found that the happiness I was receiving from the donation box was something that I could use to help others . I started to use it to bring smiles to the faces of those around me , to be more understanding and compassionate , and to help those in need . The happiness I received from the donation box changed my life . I no longer felt as though I was missing something , and I had a newfound appreciation for the people and the world around me .

Last year , I won the championship by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler . My plan was to travel back in time and use the power of distraction to lead Hitler off the path of world domination . First , I tracked down a man who had a deep hatred for Hitler and offered him a large sum of money to help me . He agreed , and we made our way to Berlin in the spring of 1943 . We infiltrated a large gathering of Hitler 's most loyal supporters and , while they were distracted , I snuck up behind Hitler and shot him in the head . The shock of the shot was enough to get the attention of the entire crowd , and the man I had hired ran away to safety while I managed to get away . My plan was effective and creative enough to win me the championship . Now , I 'm hoping to defend my title this year with an even better plan !
The snow was coming down heavily , curtains of white covering the town . Icy gusts of wind swept through the streets , sending shivers of cold throughout . Wrapping my coat tighter around me , I trudged through the blizzard , head down , aimless . My feet led me to an old church , it 's spire rising above the snow . I opened the door and stepped inside , a warm glow enveloping me . Candles flickered , illuminating the stained glass windows , each one telling a story . I moved slowly down the aisle , feeling a sense of peace . Then , I spotted it , a single white rose lying on the pew . Smiling , I picked it up , knowing who it was from . Love .

Here , the rich and powerful lived in opulence and splendor , while the poor and downtrodden were left to fend for themselves . It was a stark reminder of the inequality that existed in the world , and the struggles of the many who were living in the shadows of their own despair . But , despite the darkness that lurked in the city , there was still light to be found , if one looked hard enough . On the outskirts of the city , in a small neighborhood known as Eastwood , there was a family that was trying to make a life for themselves .

Prologue . On a cool autumn night in the small town of Willowbrook , something strange was afoot . The moonlight shone down on the desolate streets , casting eerie shadows . No one was around , and the town seemed to be asleep . But then , something stirred . A figure emerged from the darkness , its eyes glowing with an eerie light . It was a creature , one that had n't been seen in these parts before . Its presence was felt by all , although nobody knew what it was . It crept through the town , searching for something , its movements swift and silent . It was as if it was searching for something , something it desperately needed . And then , it found it . A small , unassuming house in the middle of town . The creature crept up to the windows and peered inside . There , in the middle of the room , it saw what it had been looking for . A young girl , no more than eight or nine years old , lay asleep in her bed . She was the one the creature had been searching for . Without a sound , the creature entered the house and silently made its way to the girl 's room . The creature reached out and touched the girl 's forehead . Suddenly , the girl 's eyes snapped open . She stared at the creature for a moment , her eyes wide with fear . But then , something strange happened . The creature began to speak . Its voice was soft and melodic , almost hypnotic . It told the girl of a great and powerful destiny that awaited her . It told her that she was chosen , that she was special . And then , the creature vanished , leaving the girl alone in her room . She lay there for a moment , trying to process what had just happened . Then , slowly , a smile crept onto her face . She had finally found what she was looking for . The girl had found her destiny .

I won last year 's Time Traveler Killing Hitler competition by traveling back to the year 1945 and posing as an Italian soldier in the Wehrmacht . I managed to infiltrate Hitler 's inner circle and gain his trust by playing on his fear of betrayal . Once I had gained his trust , I poisoned Hitler 's food and drink with a slow-acting toxin that allowed me to escape without suspicion . As Hitler 's health declined , I was able to move freely throughout the bunker , eventually making my way to the Fuhrerbunker itself . Once inside , I planted several explosives around the bunker 's walls and detonated them , ensuring that Hitler and his inner circle could not escape . I then made my escape back to my own time , victorious in my mission .

I won last year 's championship by successfully executing the most difficult and creative time-travel mission yet : Killing Hitler in the middle of World War II . To start , I had to plan out exactly when and where Hitler would be . I used a combination of various historical records and intelligence sources to determine his exact whereabouts at any given moment . Once I had this information , I was able to plan out the time travel route I would need to take . Next , I had to acquire the necessary materials and equipment for the mission . I had to make sure I had the right weapon , enough ammunition and other supplies to get the job done . I also had to make sure I had a way to get in and out of the situation safely . Finally , I was ready to go . I traveled back to the year 1944 and arrived at my destination . After a few tense moments , I was able to corner Hitler in a room and I shot him . I then made my escape back to the present day . My mission was a success and I was declared the champion for the year .

The happiness felt like a balm that slowly soothed away the sadness and fear I had been living with . I began to see the world differently , with a newfound appreciation for all the beauty and joy that surrounded me . I slowly started to open up to people and form meaningful relationships that I had been too scared to attempt before . I was also able to face my regrets and move forward with my life . The donation box has given me a new life filled with newfound hope , joy , and love . I am forever grateful for the person who donated happiness to me .
My victory this year was a difficult one . After months of strategizing , I finally developed a plan that would take me to a point in time just before Hitler was to give a speech . I slowly made my way towards the speech stage , slowly and carefully , evading detection . I made it to the stage just as Hitler was making his way to the podium . I had to act fast , so I took out my trusty time-traveling device and set it to just before the moment Hitler began to speak . Then I leapt forward in time , just moments before Hitler began to speak . As he was about to begin , I shouted out `` HEIL HITLER ! '' and pulled out a gun , aiming it squarely at his chest . I waited for the shock on his face , and when it came , I pulled the trigger . The entire audience gasped and I heard cries of horror in the crowd , but my mission had been accomplished . I had killed Hitler , and in doing so had won the time-traveling championship . Now , all I had to do was make sure I had enough time to get back to my own time unharmed . With the mission complete , I retreated back to the future , mission accomplished .
She only said she loved him , but he never knew what happened next . He had been so sure of his feelings for her but now he was left feeling uncertain and alone . As the days passed , he grew more and more distant , and his heart slowly sank into a deeper and darker place . He began to fill his days with anything that could help him forget the girl he had loved so deeply . He went on long walks and tried to fill the void with movies , books , and anything that could take his mind off the pain . He thought he had eventually moved on . He started to take small steps toward happiness , but he could never shake the feeling that he had been left behind . He had spent so much energy constructing a future where they 'd be together only to be shut out without explanation . The pain of those moments never fully disappeared , but over time he eventually found a way to cope . And then one day , she called . It had been months since they 'd spoken and he had expected her to remain distant , but she seemed different . She explained that she had been struggling to find the words to tell him what had happened , but now she felt ready . She only said she loved him , and there was nothing else that needed to be said .
I won last year by completing one of the most difficult time travel missions ever attempted . My mission was to travel back in time to a particular spot in France , the site of a Nazi convoy . My goal was to prevent one of the most important figures of Nazi Germany from landing in Normandy , which would have changed the outcome of World War II . I arrived just in time , and managed to disable one of the Nazi vehicles without being spotted . This had the effect of delaying the convoy long enough for the Allied forces to make their way to Normandy and launch the famous D-Day invasion . Of course , Hitler had no choice but to retreat and eventually surrender . My daring and successful mission meant that I was the only time traveler to be awarded the highest possible points for creativity and difficulty . Consequently , I was crowned the champion of the Time Traveler ’ s League and became an instant hero among my peers .
Everyone in the city was born with some kind of power , from the seemingly simple telekinesis to the truly spectacular electrokinesis . And , like the lands of old , everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were . But this city had a unique , albeit unknown , feature : Rank # 1 was indestructible . Whoever held that spot was completely untouchable , and their power was a mystery . For as long as anyone could remember , that person had been me . It was n't something I 'd ever asked for or wanted , yet here I was . Everyone seemed to know that I was Rank # 1 , and yet no one had any idea what my power was . For a while , things had been peaceful . Sure , people were jealous of my rank and the power that came with it , but no one dared to challenge me . That is , until one day . A man , known as the Black King , had come to the city . He was a powerful man , with a power similar to mine , and he wanted to take my rank . He challenged me to a duel and I accepted . We both knew the stakes : If I lost , I would lose my rank and the Black King would take my place . We prepared for battle . I could feel the tension in the air as the people of the city watched , their eyes wide with anticipation . When the moment came , I did something unexpected . I stepped forward and , instead of using my mysterious power , I knelt at the Black King 's feet and surrendered . At first , he was surprised . Then , a huge smile appeared on his face . He knew that he had a powerful enemy in me , one who had chosen to surrender instead of risk a fight . In that moment , the Black King had a new found respect for me . From then on , he never questioned my rank nor my mysterious power . To this day , I still have no idea what my power is , but I do know that it is far more powerful than any of the other powers in this city . I also know that I must use it wisely and only when necessary . The people in this city may not understand my power , but they do understand the power of surrender .
The sun was beating down on their bare shoulders as they stepped out of the car . Chattering nervously , they closed their doors and stared up at the old , timber house in front of them , dreading what they were about to uncover . They quietly moved around the crumbling walls , searching for the answers they were looking for . With every new step , a sense of dread seemed to intensify until finally , they discovered what had happened . The full story was now clear , but it was one none of them were prepared for .
The shock of seeing yourself causes a wave of emotions to wash over you - guilt , shame , regret , and sorrow . You find yourself facing all of the mistakes you have made and all of the pain you have caused yourself . You realize that your own actions have been the biggest barrier between you and getting into Heaven . It 's in that moment that you make a choice : do you forgive yourself and accept your mistakes , or do you continue to hold onto the bitterness and hurt ? With this choice , you understand that Heaven is still attainable for you , but you must be willing to confront the person you hurt the most first - yourself . Only then can you truly move forward and strive for the redemption that awaits .
Once upon a time there was a kind , gentle creature called the Unicorn . It lived peacefully in the forests of a small kingdom known as the Kingdom of Faeleth . The Unicorn was loved by all the creatures in the kingdom , but sadly its time came to an end when a fearful creature known as the Dark Horse arrived . The Dark Horse was a powerful creature with an insatiable hunger for power and with its arrival began a reign of terror across the land . The Dark Horse was relentless in its pursuit of power , eventually coming to the doorstep of the Unicorn 's forest . The Unicorn and its allies feared that the Dark Horse would soon take control of the kingdom and so they devised a plan . The plan was to have the Unicorn use its powerful horn to defend the kingdom against the Dark Horse . Along with its allies , it led an attack and was able to overpower the Dark Horse and restore peace to the Kingdom of Faeleth . The Unicorn was welcomed back as a hero and was honored and respected for the courage it showed to fight for the kingdom . The kingdom prospered and thanks to the bravery of the Unicorn , it is still peaceful to this day .

I had a pretty simple strategy for winning the contest . With each attempt to kill Hitler , I tried a different approach . I tried to think of really creative , unorthodox ways to take him out , hoping that the judges would be impressed by my originality . My first attempt was to make sure that I was there when he was born . My goal was to hit him with a mallet before he had a chance to do any harm . I still remember the look of surprise on the judges ’ faces when they saw that one ! My second attempt was to travel back to 1922 and put a bomb in the beer hall where he was planning to give a speech . Sadly , I was a few days too late and the speech had been canceled . I still got points for the attempt though . My third attempt was to travel back to the early 1920s and make sure he never had the platform to be the leader of the Nazi party . I managed to successfully change key events in his life , like getting him kicked out of art school and convincing him to move to Vienna . Again , the judges were impressed . My final attempt was to travel to 1938 and make sure that one of the assassination attempts on him was successful . I managed to get a gun into the venue and shoot him myself . It was a risky move , but it paid off . The judges gave me maximum points for that one and I was the proud winner of the contest !

It was a strange world I lived in , a world of people with unusual powers . From telekinesis to electrokinesis to sensing danger , forces and powers beyond mundane understanding lay in the open air , waiting to be tapped and used by those brave enough to recognize their abilities . I was one of those brave enough . Though I was ranked as number one , no one knew what power I had . I believed it was because they were all too busy trying to outdo each other , vying for a higher rank , that they had n't taken the time to figure it out yet . But I was content with the status quo . My anonymity was my shield and I was safe in my position of neutrality . My power was my own and I was content keeping it that way . Until the day a violent crime shook the city . A powerful man , interested in obtaining a higher rank , had killed another , more powerful man and took his rank from him . What followed was a wave of paranoia and fear , taking over the city . That ’ s when I decided I had to do something . Drawing strength from my newfound power , I confronted the criminals , utilizing my ability to overwhelm their efforts . As I used my power , I realized that the ability I had was the ability to control the elements . From fire to water to wind , I could command it all . My victory earned me fame and respect amongst the people of the city . Knowing that I could use my power to protect them , they were happy to keep my secret safe . The day had ended with justice , leaving me with a lingering peace . I was still number one , but now I had the respect of my peers and the knowledge of my true power . The day would be remembered as the day I revealed my hidden strength .
Prologue . The familiar , yet intense aroma of freshly brewed coffee permeated the air of the busy city as three figures ventured out into the cool , autumn night . A light , gentle breeze blew through the streets and the echoing of footsteps filled the otherwise peaceful silence in the still of the night . The three individuals walking side by side , though only acquaintances , seemed to share an unspoken bond that few could understand . A bond that had been forged through their shared experiences of the past and their mutual understanding of the events that had transpired . The streets were filled with an uncanny energy that seemed to be beckoning them towards their destiny . It was as if a hidden force had guided them to this very spot , as if they wanted to be here and nothing else would do .

Where their destination lay , none could be certain . But one thing was for sure , the night had brought them something unexpected , something that demanded their attention and offered up its secrets .

Last year 's competition was intense . I had to really pull out all the stops to take home the championship title . In order to win , I had to come up with the most creative and difficult plan possible . My winning plan involved travelling back not just one year , but two . This meant that I had to come up with a plan to go back and stop Hitler before he ever had a chance to come to power . To accomplish this , I hatched a conspiracy that involved infiltrating the Nazi party and turning key officials against Hitler . By gathering intel about what Hitler was up to and reporting it back to the time traveling community , I eventually identified a handful of key players who could potentially be swayed to oppose Hitler . I then went back in time and worked to turn them against Hitler using a combination of bribes , blackmail , and threats . The plan worked , and eventually the conspiracy spread until it reached the ears of Hitler himself . Faced with the threat of revolution , Hitler decided to flee to Argentina instead of claiming power . By removing Hitler before he could come to power , I had successfully completed my mission and won the championship title .
She only said she loved him , but what lay beneath his sweet smile was a lie . She had never expected to have her heart broken the way that it did when she found out the truth . It seemed as if almost overnight she had gone from being the centre of his world to being nothing more than a memory . Their relationship had been full of passion and joy , or at least , it had seemed so . But as time wore on , so too did the love he had claimed to have for her . Soon , all that was left was her heart aching in his wake . At first , she tried to blame herself , tried to tell herself that she had n't done enough to give the love they had a chance to grow . But the truth was , it had never been real . He had only said he loved her , a meaningless phrase that had taken her heart pieces and left her empty . She only said she loved him .
I won champion of killing Hitler last year by traveling to April 20th , 1945 and completely taking over the Fuhrerbunker . I emptied the bunker of all soldiers and personnel and then replaced them with my own loyal crew of prisoners . Then , when Hitler returned , I had my loyal crew surround him and fired a single shot at his head , killing him instantly . It was n't easy , but I managed to pull it off without any casualties and the judges awarded me points for both creativity and difficulty . It took a lot of planning , strategy , and organization , but in the end I am glad that I was able to put an end to the nightmare of Hitler 's reign and win the championship for killing him .
Prologue . The sun rose above the horizon , casting a warm light and glittering across the tranquil lake , while a gentle breeze rustled the trees surrounding it . It was a beautiful morning , and the birds were in full song . The small village of Benina was stirring as the people began their daily routines , but among them was one who was restless . The young girl , named Mina , had been living in Benina for the past seven years , ever since her family moved away from their home in the big city . Mina had always been a curious , adventurous girl and was eager to explore the world beyond her small home . She awoke extra early that day , with an eagerness to explore the land and yearning to find something new . Mina made her way down to the lake , her bare feet taking her across the damp grass . When she arrived at the shore , she stood at the edge of the lake and spun in circles , taking in the beauty of the morning and the peaceful stillness of the water . After a few moments of silence , a single thought ran through her head – she wanted something more than the mundane routine of her life . With that , she grabbed her worn bag , which held a few belongings , and made her way into the forest surrounding the lake . Little did she know that today would be the start of a journey that would change her life – and the world – forever .

She only said she loved him . Dave had been dating Liz for a few months now , and while they had always had a great connection , neither of them had yet voiced the `` L word '' . Last night , that all changed . Dave had taken Liz to the place where they had their first date , and as night began to fall , he nervously asked her if she felt the same for him that he felt for her . After a long pause and a deep breath , she finally responded with three simple words : `` I love you . '' Dave 's heart skipped a beat - although he could sense her hesitation , and a doubt started to stir in his mind . `` Did she mean it , or was she just going along with what he was saying ? '' he wondered to himself , as he drove Liz home . When they arrived , she paused before getting out of the car , and looked directly into his eyes - almost as if she had read his thoughts . `` I only said I loved you , '' she told him , `` because that 's how I feel . I have n't felt this way about anyone before , so do n't doubt it , okay ? '' Dave was overwhelmed by her honesty , and he finally understood that this was real . He returned her sentiment and they embraced , knowing this was the start of something wonderful between them .

The city was bustling with life and excitement . Everywhere I looked , I saw people using their powers to their advantage . There were telekinetics and electrokinetics lighting up the skies , sensing those in the crowd , and so much more . It was a sight that never got old to me . I had grown up in this city , my entire life and I was by far the most powerful . Everyone knew it but no one knew the source of my power . I was rank number one and no one could challenge my authority . The people in the city , including the other power users , respected and feared me . They feared my power because they knew no one could stand up to me and I could easily take out any one of them . That was one of the rules of the city . If someone with a low rank killed someone with a high rank , they would replace them and obtain their rank . No one ever tried to challenge me because they knew they would fail . I was the top of the hierarchy and there was no point in mounting a challenge against me . I was untouchable and everyone in the city accepted it . However , one day a strange man appeared in the city . He was clothed in a long black robe and he had something the others did n't . Power . He claimed to be of a higher rank than me and challenged me for my rank . I accepted the challenge , much to the surprise of the other power users and the people of the city . We dueled in a large arena at the center of the city and much to everyone 's surprise , I won . I easily took out the strange man with my secret power and took his rank . The crowd was stunned , but so was I. I had n't expected the strange man to possess such powerful abilities , but then again I never knew exactly how powerful I was until that day . From that point on , everyone feared and respected me even more than before . With my newfound power and knowledge , I vowed to protect the city and everyone in it . I had become a symbol of power and greatness , and I would use that status to keep the city safe . No one would ever challenge me again , and I would rule over the city with an iron fist .
Once upon a time there was a kingdom on the edge of the world , a place of majestic mountains and lush hills , where the sun shone more brightly than any where else . Called the Kingdom of Levina , it was a land of enchantment , a place where the magical creatures of legend appeared in its forests and streams , and the people lived in harmony with nature . But Levina was also in danger , for a powerful and wicked force threatened to overtake it . An army had been sent to conquer the kingdom , a leader of great skill and ambition , but he had been thwarted by the courage and skill of the warrior at its helm , a princess called Riana . Riana was a brave and resourceful young woman who had vowed to protect her kingdom from any threats . As she faced this formidable foe , she used every ounce of her courage and skill to repel the invaders . But in the end , the villain was too powerful ; he had kept the princess at bay for weeks , and her people were nearly at the end of their strength . In her darkest hour , an unexpected ally appeared . A being of immense power and wisdom , it called itself Serpa . It declared that it had been sent to protect the kingdom and its people , and offered to join Riana in her fight against the invading forces . Riana accepted , and the two allies used powerful magic to repel the invaders from Levina . But something else had been left in the battle , something sinister and hidden . Now , as the kingdom celebrates its victory and its rescuer , Riana must confront this mysterious force and uncover its secrets . Armed with her courage and determination , she sets out on a quest to expose the truth , and to save her beloved kingdom once and for all .
The sun shone through her bedroom window , casting its warmth in a comfortable embrace across the room . Aneesa shuffled awake from her pillow-top mattress and hopped down from her bed . She threw open the curtains and took in the view outside , watching the leaves of the nearby trees as they swayed gently in the breeze . Taking a deep breath , she could smell the fragrant blossoms of the nearby willow tree . Nostalgia set in ; she remembered the days when she 'd climb it and get lost in its branches . With feet moving on their own accord , she stepped outside and made her way over to the tree . She stood there , watching with a newfound appreciation as the leaves rustled in the wind . Finally , she reached up her hand to touch the tree , her fingers tracing its lines as though she were reading a Braille message . Space .
There had been rumors among the people of the city for years ; whispers of a secret , unex-plainable power . It was something no one was able to understand , something no one had ever seen before . It was the power of the one they had simply come to call ‘ Number One ’ . Nobody knew who Number One was , not even Number One themselves . Every attempt to find out had been fruitless ; for the inhabitants of the city , Number One was unreachable , unassailable , and feared . The city was full of those with extraordinary abilities , from levitation to electrokinesis and beyond , and each person was assigned a rank based on their power level . Ranking number one was a position that had been empty more than it had been filled , as no one had been able to reach that level of strength until now . It seemed as though no one was ever going to get close to Number One ’ s level of power , and the people of the city had all but given up hope . That was until something strange started to happen . People higher than Number One ’ s rank started turning up dead , drained of all the power they had acquired . Rumors circulated quickly and soon it became crystal clear ; somehow , someone was killing the people of higher rank in order to obtain their power . Outraged , the city ’ s leaders attempted to put a stop to the carnage by launching a manhunt for its perpetrator . With each death , it became a little more obvious that Number One was the one behind the killings . Yet , no one had any real proof and the mystery of their identity remained unsolved . Then , one day , a group of brave individuals ventured deep inside the city ’ s sewers in search of the truth . After hours of searching , they finally came face to face with the power behind the murders ; it was Number One . The group discovered that Number One ’ s power was something far greater than anyone else ’ s . It was the power to teleport , to move between places instantaneously . With this power , Number One had been able to silently drain away the power of those of higher rank and take it as their own . After this discovery , all of the people of the city were in shock ; they had never seen power like this before . Despite the law , many in the city came to respect and admire the mysterious power of Number One

My name is Robert and I am a resident of the city of Paragon . I have lived here for my entire life and I have watched this city change and evolve as we opened our doors to those who were different . Many of these people had unique powers that set them apart from the rest of society . We called these people superhumans , as their gifts often seemed beyond what mere mortals could do . In Paragon , these superhumans were ranked according to their power level . I found myself at the top of the power rankings and by far the most powerful individual in the city . I was known as Number One , and no one knew what my power was because I kept it a closely guarded secret . But with great power comes tempting offers and dangerous challenges . I had to fend off continual attacks by those who wished to take my title and become the top rank . There were many who thought that if they could kill me , then they would be able to obtain my rank and become the Number One . In the past , I had managed to stay at the top of the power rankings by using a combination of intelligence , luck , and skill . But I could sense that as times were changing , so too were the stakes in this game . That is why I decided to reveal my secret . My power was not one that could be seen or measured , but it was powerful nonetheless . I had the power of one over science and technology . Simply put , I could manipulate anything that was made of metal , circuitry , and computer code -- in short , I was able to control any form of machinery . With this power , I become even more powerful and I immediately made sure that everyone in the city knew of it . With this new-found knowledge , fewer people would dare to challenge me , and I learned to take better precautions against those who thought their power was enough to defeat me . Now I was in a much better position to protect myself . I had learned that with great power also comes great responsibility , and I knew that if I ever wanted to keep my rank as the Number One , then I needed to use my abilities responsibly and for the greater good of Paragon .

It was quite the challenge to become last years champion of “ Killing Hitler ” , the time traveling sport . After months of planning and practice I was confident that I was ready . When it was time to travel to my target , I decided to go for something extremely creative and difficult to execute . I went back in time to Nazi Germany in 1939 . Hitler was giving a speech in a public square and I watched him from the shadows . When it was time to take action , I approached him and pulled out an ancient crossbow from my pocket . I fired then bolt at Hitler with a direct hit in the heart . I then quickly got away and vanished back into the shadows . The crowd erupted into shock and confusion as they witnessed Hitler 's death . As I looked back from the time portal , I knew I had achieved victory . The creativity and difficulty of my mission earned me a high score and the title of “ Killing Hitler Champion ” .
Once upon a time , there was a brave knight named Sir Gavin who lived in a small kingdom far away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities . He was well-known for being an honorable and chivalrous knight who honored the vows of loyalty and justice he had sworn to uphold . Sir Gavin had a beautiful and loving fiancee named Princess Genevieve who was the only daughter of the King and Queen of the kingdom . They were faithfully in love and had promised to wed when their love and devotion had become visible to the entire kingdom . One day , Sir Gavin was asked to participate in a tournament to prove his worthiness as a knight and he could not refuse such a challenge . He rode off on his noble steed , braving the elements and the foreign lands that awaited him , on a journey that could last weeks or even months . Little did Sir Gavin know , a treacherous sorcerer had also been watching his movements and had sent his minions to capture him and keep him occupied until the tournament was over . The Princess waited anxiously for her beau to return and the King and Queen of the kingdom decided to host a grand ball while they waited for his return . Princess Genevieve and her maids of honor got dressed in their best gowns in hopes of distracting the guests from the anxiety that had taken over the castle . When the grand ball was in progress , a strange traveller arrived at the castle gates . He was a stranger that only looked vaguely familiar to the King and Queen . Little did they know , the stranger was Sir Gavin in disguise . He had managed to free himself from the sorcerer 's hold and found his way back to the kingdom . With a little help from his fellow knights , Sir Gavin surprise Princess Genevieve and their families by revealing his true identity . The happy couple got married soon after that and they lived happily ever after .
Last year , I used an unconventional method to win the Time Traveler 's “ Kill Hitler ” tournament . I hatched a plan to visit April 20th , 1945 , the day Hitler committed suicide and attempt to prevent him from taking his own life . My plan involved sneaking into Hitler ’ s bunker , disguised as an SS officer . Once inside I had to break into Hitler ’ s inner chamber , and with the help of a small group of accomplices , overpower him and keep him in captivity until the war was over . The plan didn ’ t quite go as expected , and we ended up capturing the wrong man . However , news of the capture had already spread and Hitler , realizing the game was up , took his own life rather than face justice . It was a close call , but in the end I succeeded . I won the tournament with a combination of daring and quick thinking . It was a competition I won ’ t soon forget .
My victory began with the stroke of genius of turning my plans inside out and going back to the year 1939 . It was the height of Nazi Germany and the prospects seemed daunting . But I was undeterred . I first set my sights on Hitler ’ s inner circle , carefully tapping into their conversations with civilian conversations and even carefully manipulating some conversations already happening or posed as questions . In this way , I was able to subtly and effectively sow distrust amongst Hitler and his most trusted advisors . Slowly , I worked on convincing them that Hitler was not the leader they needed . By the time I had my grand finale , I had effectively secured the loyalty of all of Hitler ’ s most influential allies and convinced them that he was a threat to the nation . I then hid in plain sight , and on the day of a grand military parade , followed Hitler ’ s orders one last time . What happened next will go down in history . I stood a few yards away from Hitler and with a single act of cunning and bravery , I managed to shoot Hitler at the exact right time , killing him on the spot and ending his reign of terror . My victory sparked a wave of celebration and relief that swept through Nazi Germany , to the world and even to myself . By winning this championship , I made history , and for that , I am grateful .
The city of Antioch had been home to me for as long as I could remember . It was a strange place , one that thrived on the strange powers of its citizens . Telekinesis , electrokinesis , and all manner of supernatural powers could be found here . As with any city , the powerful and influential were ranked . I was at the top , but none knew what my power was , thus granting me the anonymity of anonymity . A few weeks ago , I was walking through one of the city 's more seedy areas when I spotted something strange . A man was walking around , clad entirely in black , with a knowing glint in his eye . He was clearly no resident of Antioch , and something deep inside of me suggested that he was here for a purpose . I followed the man , keeping a safe distance , until he finally stopped in a small alley . As I crept closer , I heard him begin to talk in a low voice . `` I have a place that would make a great base of operations for those who wish to rise in the ranks of Antioch . '' He said , his voice like a snake 's . I quickly realized that the man was recruiting new members into his mysterious organization . The only catch was that you had to be willing to take down someone of a higher rank than yourself in order to be admitted into the organization . I began to walk away , not wishing to find out any more than I already had . Suddenly , the man 's eyes lit up . `` Wait ! '' He shouted . `` You possess the power that I need . '' He said , his voice dripping with anticipation . `` You are the one who can help me . '' I had been found out . The man had seen my power , the one I had been so adept at hiding , the one I had been so careful to keep under wraps . Taking a deep breath , I admitted as much to him . He clapped his hands in delight , having finally found the key to his plans . With a smirk , he continued . `` Very well , then . You are the one I am looking for . '' He said . `` Address my organization as you like , for the sake of anonymity , and take your rightful place at the top of the ranks in Antioch ! '' I had no choice but to comply . I knew that if I refused , I would be risking my life and much more . With a resigned sigh , I accepted my fate ,

At first , you were confused by the foreign emotion . You had never felt such a sensation before . You tried to understand it , but all your efforts seemed futile . You asked yourself , what is this feeling ? What does it mean to be happy ? You soon discovered that with the feeling of happiness , came other emotions such as joy , contentment and a sense of accomplishment . You felt an overall feeling of well-being and connectedness with the world around you . Your life changed dramatically with the newfound emotion . You became more outgoing and had an appreciation for the small things in life.Suddenly , you felt a warmth inside you , a warmth that comes from being surrounded by happiness .

At first I was overwhelmed with the unfamiliar feeling that was crashing over me . But , as I felt it in its overwhelming entirety , I felt a strange peace wash over me that I had never felt before . Tears of joy rolled down my cheeks , and the people around me were confused . It was strange to feel the same emotion for everyone and everything in the same way . I began to really appreciate the act of giving , and started to spend more time with the donation box , looking through other people ’ s offerings . I asked myself questions about how their emotions worked , and what things triggered them . Emotions that I would have never felt on my own , I was now experiencing through others ’ donated feelings . The world around me became brighter , and while I was n't filled with an all-consuming joy , I was now capable of being content . I 'm grateful to the person who donated that happiness , as I now have a much different outlook on life . This experience has also opened my eyes to the idea that emotion is not something to be feared but something to be embraced . We all have access to a kaleidoscope of emotions , and although I was born without them , I 'm thankful for the chance to experience a new life filled with emotion .

Tensions between those of high rank and those of a lower rank swirled around the city , fueled by a strange game of one-upmanship and power dynamics . In a bid to arrive at the top , many resorted to dueling each other - willing to risk life and limb in pursuit of another ’ s rarified rank . I was curious , incensed and living in the eye of the storm - safest by a few feet while driven winds threatened to push me skyhigh - I thought I was on top . We all assumed I held the throne of highest rank - # 1 - without question . Yet , no one knew what kind of power I had . My parents had died long before I was old enough to claim my power ; although it had seemed I discovered electricity manipulation by involuntarily shorting out our villa in the Greater Part of Vekta City . Dad 's research papers scribbled in frustration verged upon unlocking my secret , but I carried more questions about my identity than a teenager ever should . The weeks charged by . One heated night , challengers eager for my # 1 rank sought good enough means toward a permanent parting and a solution to their political woes . I resorted to my defense systems - a subtle image through mirror apparatuses combined with cognitive tricks and flips , allowed me to confuse my attackers when their own powers collided against mine . They charged and spat and tanked desperately , yet their electricity-born powers barely passed while heavily reverbed back and forth threateningly . Meanwhile , I toyed with them indirectly by locking them in chase of empty footsteps while throwing destruction in and around the vicinity of my battleground . Until the effects of exhaustion an hatred flipped tired into fury together and all abruptly paused . Until the challengers gained frightful amusement at figures I had created - plumes of imposing smoke and man-noises issued manifestly from my slithers , doing minor wonders with silent orders while appearing infinitely fantastic against approaching foes as each were driven back afraid or enthralled or any which-way with pleasure-locked curiosity against the certain truth too awesome to believe . I will never forget the wondering expressions of them searching for me and for the sum of what I was in the stuff-air of music and the choking electricity - shattering what already felt both so real and so sublime and expanding further away from each other for eons inside dragonfly 's dreams . Unknowingly then , and by adrenaline trick
Ferrin Aaron was never like the other kids . At six , he knew he wanted to pursue a life of adventure , something wild and exciting , although he had no idea what that meant exactly . It was as if the stars pointed the way to his destiny when a lamplighter accidentally upended a box of treasure maps from a dusty brass cart he 'd been pushing on his nightly route . The young child 's naïve eyes brightened at the thought as he marveled at the possibilities the colorful replications held . Taking a burning oil lantern , he navigated his way along the coastal stones to find the collections , not feeling the moist Zephyr that passed between . It was as if Ferrin Aaron had been pardoned and admitted to some sort of mythical realm fit for any courageous explorer . An inaudible chorus sang in harmony in his head as he carefully explored the cart , prodding and panning upon the enticing maps scrawled on weather-beaten paper in ancient calligraphy with mysterious meandering destinations where anything could happen . The bold child resolved to take on every assignment the maps outlined before nightfall . And like a sponge , Ferrin Aaron absorbed the vibrant history of the blurred tales who artists seen moments once forgotten held onto . From forgotten Indigenous roots rising of the Powhatan Nation to trekking across rivers filled with Chinese immigrants who sought that same yearning wealth of knowledge , he stroked through the wet testament assimilating every detail . He was ultimately welcomed with vast treasuries filled with puzzles to piece together into shapes that bound like secrets strewn in graphing expedition by the crews who 'd pour ink blots of patchy recollection along the alleyways and secrets found with clippings of legend unfamiliar into eternity . By nightfall , the brave little traveler had been back in the adventurous spirit and would keep true his nightfall plundering promise for thee years to come .

In the depths of the frost-shrouded Blackwoods , nestled between a rare grove of sporegumm trees , sat a little cottage so cautiously hidden that it was barely a whisper of a whisper that even the birds could not hear . It was assumed by those around it that the cottage had been around for generations , brought up over the years and passed down the generations in a comfortingly familiar way . Little did any of them know that there was a unique origin to the cottage and everything inside—days and even sometimes weeks away from the busy world , tucked away in the silent tree shadows to dwell and cook and thrive in . Despite its amusing tale , the little cottage was now famous for its impressive history of producing some of the greatest recipes in all of the land—crafted over many generations with such attention to detail and care that each bowl , meal , and pot of tea prepared was sure to tantalize any taster of such flavors . The skills within these strong kitchen walls had been carefully perfected with time and perfected each execution season after season . Elian Marrmon was the matriarch of the cottage , and rightly so - she knew more than most about these family recipes and appreciated nearly all flavors and ingredients to the art . She kept her orders hidden inside hollowed-out trees by her dwelling , and simply waited for the eagles to come and distant acquaintances to hear her distant call for orders . Luck it seemed must be of the infinite amounts as every year more and more people ventured to the small cottage—far beyond a reputable distance of miles and minds -- to try whatever odd dish Elian had created . It was known that her dishes consistently left the taste buds far yet in a wonderful sensation that no fork nor spoon could have possibly reached before . By all means , it could simply be eased dismissed as such quaint custom until a starry night arrived . This special night held everyone ’ s collective breath in anticipation , adjusting the weighted air with intrigue for the dinner Elian would present later on . On that evening , the cottage was bustling with small lightning bugs and the clamoring voices which finally , left silent as the night cooled and the stars began to shine through the distant window of the little house . Many delicacies were served which many find hard to believe as even Elian Marrimon wasn ’ t given to believing that whatever secretly grew behind her cottage walls could change such drinks and meals— causing the humble grounds to give life
You take a deep breath as you face yourself . You think of all the hurtful things you 've done—the lies , the betrayal , the broken promises . You feel guilt in your heart , but you know you ca n't change the past . In the silence , a gentle voice comes through . `` I forgive you , '' it says . It 's enough to bring tears to your eyes . You realize then that if you can forgive yourself , if you can accept the mistakes you made and strive to do better , true redemption lies within . After a long pause , you whisper back , `` I forgive myself . '' A warmth floods you , like a light beaming through the darkness . You now understand what it means to make peace and reconcile with yourself . As the feeling fades , you open your eyes to be met with the pearly gates .
Once upon a time there was a small and sleepy village nestled amongst the forested hills , its inhabitants going about their lives in much the same way they had in generations past . Little else ever changed in the village ; it seemed as if a perfect Sunday could circle around and repeat every week , and nobody had a single care in the world . But beneath the balmy facade , of course , great secrets evolved . Little did the villagers know their world was about to be rocked by a mysterious stranger who would bring with him knowledge from far and wide which would enable them to glimpse whole new possibilities within their own lives . For strange adventures and tales of sheer impulse and magic awaited—judging by the stars above , powerful omens that this would truly be the stuff of legend . One curiosity overlooked by all in that small village was the small white rabbit hut tucked away in a forgotten corner of it , only to be known to an alchemist who would soon enter the fray . He could feel a powerful intuition that this was just the place he was looking for . With a deep sense of jubilation , he followed the call of the wise white doe , a beautiful creature of mystical nature that surrounded his hut and guided him through a second chance his life had been waiting for all along . The man eagerly listened to his intuition , reaching into special chambers in his clinic to fetch tools and strange mixtures , cloaking himself in pages of importance to discover where the dewdrops came pouring from . And so the alchemist worked and waited for the night to arrive and bring with it possibilities that he could finally lay his hands on… conjuring tales no one had seen in any stolen starlight . The sounds of a brewing storm wrapped tightly reached the man , like a ghost twitching at his fingers and toes , urging him to leap and encompass a thunderstruck night . Armed with his supplies the alchemist moved ahead on thin silver light and saw his destiny as the storm crash lit up his path , its edges shimmering in fractured skies night after night . Calling everyone ’ s attention towards the cleverly concealed door , he whispered excitedly to the gathering night with orders of wonder . And it obeyed , granting him safe passage into miraculous skies ahead , weaving roads of hope , charm and heartache that witnesses caught a secret glimpse of in clear moonlight glistenings . He knew major transformations lie in
`` She only said she loved him . '' Audrey had been going on dates with Richard for months , but it just was n't working out for them . She had tried her best to make it work , but something was missing . One night , Richard finally decided to end things tears formed in her eyes as he told her that he could no longer continue on with their relationship . She wanted to give him a response , but could only manage to utter the words ' I love you . ' Richard looked straight into her eyes and gave her a sad smile , not expecting such a statement after so much time had passed without her showing any strong affection toward him . Richard nodded goodbye and took his leave , leaving her alone in the dark and hopeless . Audrey realized that only now , when everything was almost ending , did she finally find courage to tell him how she truly felt in her heart . `` She only said she loved him . '' And with that phrase , her brief love story with Richard drew to an end .
Standing before you was not your old nemesis . Instead you saw yourself with with a heavy heart , encumbered by heaviness . The weight of guilt did not diminish the expression of sorrow , even through the expressions of regret . For in repentance there was hope . As you looked upon yourself , it became clear that although mistakes had been made , that the path that path was a desire for redemption , reconciliation , and resolution . The resolution to mistimes , wrongs , and hurts , that had broken you down . It was time to forgive both forgiven and those that had wronged you . In this moment , you reclaimed what was lost , and as you reached out to grab it , redemption slowly crept through your spirit . At last , you felt accepted . This was heaven , this was reunion , this signaled an end to all your trauma , and only then did you breathe with a battered , redemptive and embracing sigh . You were at peace .
I staggered back in bemused shock at the unexpected feeling that surged through me . As I sampled this newfound emotion , my heart twitched and I felt a spark of happiness ignite within me . It took a few moments before I regained my composure and the awareness that this feeling was not coming from me- it had been donated to me ! I struggled to find the words to express my appreciation for the generous act of kindness , looking up gratefully at the stranger who had contributed such a gift from their own well of emotion . I could only stand there stunned , reaping emotions from this newfound understanding of the world around me that I had only vaguely understood before . Over the coming days and months , I found myself growing healthier and happy as I explored and grew with these donated emotions . I could never thank the anonymous donor enough , truly my life had been changed and was so much richer for it . Once this happiness was successfully incorporated into my life , I began to notice other more rarefied emotions bubbling up- pleasure , contentment , contentment- as if the happiness had opened the floodgates in my soul to other more complex feelings . The strange power of this donation still hums within me as I Reflect with a sense of accomplishment over having been given new roles beyond the dry receptacle of emotionless Nothingness . I savor every moment of these newly felt Judgments and accept and understand the notion that in life we are wiser to accept donations of that which binds and unifies us , than the toxic shame of what enslaves us . I have never shied away from sadness , fear and regret since feeling the hand of a better life through this kindness , I cherish being part of a world worth donating emotions to and championing new routes of feeling empathy and belonging .
Everything about this was familiar - from the disappointment lacing your companion 's expression , to the turmoil stirring inside of you . After all , you had caused this pain . Your guilt was a palpable thing in this moment - hot and heavy . You silently said sorry to yourself for the hurt you 'd inflicted - sorrowful for what was , and hopeful for what still could be . Your companion said nothing , allowing the action to speak for itself . With a few kind words and a nod of understanding , Heaven accepted you through grace .
Last year , to win the competition , I had to come up with the most creative way possible to stop Adolf Hitler from coming to power . So , after spending many months of research , I devised a plan to use temporal engineering to sabotage Hitler 's rise . First , I created a temporal field that stranded Hitler in Berlin during early 1921- exactly one year prior to his failed coup attempt . I then took advantage of the time loop I had created to intercept Hitler 's ascension to power . First , I went back to 1920 , one year before the coup attempt to strategically ensure that Hitler 's plan failed . Leveraging my influence , I ensured that his propaganda materials were wildly off the target that he had intended- leading to the failed coup in 1921 . To further ensure his complete inability to capitalize on another attmept , I returned again to 1919 to prevent his election and swiftly worked to reorganize the power structures in the Weimar Republic . Then , with a combination of other strategies involving nearly three dozen delayed trips in the past and using my influence as a champion time traveler to stir up key alliances in the Reichstag and overthrow the Enabling Act , which Hitler later would have leveraged to become Dictator of the Third Reich . Using these strategies , I ultimately ensured a victory , outmaneuvering and outsmarting numerous top contenders who over the years also tried to devise a plausible and effective solution to eradicate Hitler and prevent the Second Weimar Republic from being established . To this day , my name still stands on the wall at the Time Travel Expo as the champion of last year .
Struggling physically and mentally to adjust to this forced new way of living , she nonetheless gets up each day and carries on .

It had been years since I had first arrived at this extraordinary city - a place where anyone could claim a unique power deemed uncommon elsewhere . I was met with abounding awe as the crowds stared in disbelief as I walked down the busy streets , or the equally-amazed gossiping as I approached marketplaces and cafes . Administered power rankings were slapped diagonally like beacons of solemn warning on the backs and foreheads of its citizens . Everyone knew I was dialled into the highest radiog , rank number one . The only thing no one knew was exactly what kind of power I possessed . My powers were strange - strange enough that I kept it a mystery . The imitable gift yielded enough supernatural influence to inflate my status to perfection , way beyond its preceding ascension rate . As competitors moved laterally towards the top of the power rankings , I remained the benign guardian of the sacred summit . But no power play ever formed itself in my divided grasp . All I had to primarily defend my sacredness , and protect those around me , are the faecial disguises and cold demeanours I endowed myself with in order to disguise my true capacity . The combination of esoteric law , arcane design , and unbiased ordeals all ensure I remain firmly the king of rank one no matter how long the reign lasts . Yet often still the timid yet relentless quest to decipher my hidden might laid siege in their hearts of hearts , never loosening until even I know how far the alexipharmic capabilities extend . The anonymity was almost my evidence of safety , an aspect I allowed myself to bask in even if it length somewhat foolishly along many a brash brazen eyeful of death inquisition . My secret weapon lay bestowed beneath the levelheaded mask I had coined upon initial contact . As rumors and tales screech into fervor once more , my strength and endurance were irrevocably challenged and the evil quest beyond my intangible savoir ached persistent . The days pace by but even the sneakiest informants could never unveil , besides myself - even past succumbing to gruesome demise - what powerful artifices concluded everyone 's fierce speculations at the apex of the power rankings - namely , me . That very ingredient is an immeasurable well known only to me .
As the years go by , it 's natural that your relationship changes , and I know it 's difficult to think that you might eventually be forgotten . Even though the physical manifestation and communication with you may be weakening in the days and years to come , the memories of our friendship will remain in the heart . Take comfort in knowing that somewhere deep long after my imaginary friend end , the one that used to whisper stories at bedtime or fly around in an imaginary spaceship , there 's a place that will uphold the happy memories we shared and I cherish those . Know that even if I do n't talk anymore about you , just seeing the look in your eyes when we laughed or exchanged stories is something I cherish . You taught me wonderful things about the world and although I 'm now bigger and newer things lay ahead for me , I have irreplaceable memories of our time together that will stay close to my heart forever . Even though we wo n't be speaking to each other , please know that I could never forget about you . And thank you for being with me all these years - my world wo n't be the same without you .
Each year it has become increasingly difficult to find a unique and creative way to explain how Ikilled Hitler , but last year I managed to prevail over the other time traveler competitors . I decided to go for an indirect creative take on what I had to do in the competition . Rather than actually killing Hitler , I removed him from power . Starting from just after the Beer Hall Putsch , I went back in time and intervened in order to influence the decision-making path that led to supporting a rise of power for the Nazi party in the years that followed . My first primary objective was to intervene in and alter Hitler 's public speaking tours , traditionally known to be very effective in appealing to people . I used my knowledge to craft logical and sensible , yet strong arguments about why Hitler 's methods of politics are not advantageous to a healthy Germany . I also reminded the people of other discussion organizations where different approaches can help achieve the same aspirations the Nazi 's promised without creatinglong-lasting instabilities . My secondary objective was disruptive tactics within the Nazi party , by reaching out to many of the key people in the attempted putsch , highlighting their disadvantage is supporting such dictatorial policies , by using facts on economic , social , and middle-class stability in unfavorable ways fuel Hitler 's ambition . Additionally , having an influence on corruptible business hubs and interfering with their internal operations eased the chances of third-party donations to the Nazi cause . By the end , the competition judges were overwhelmed by my drive and ingenuity and luckily found all my tactical maneuvers worth noting . It proved to them that engaging in meaningful historical topics with non offensive tactics shouldmatters whose resolutions conform to the bedrock of creativity which serve as the foundation of time travelling . Ultimately , transitioning me into becoming this years champion !
Once upon a time , there was a small village nestled in the hills of the Irish countryside . The villagers enjoyed their simple life , filled with plenty of hearty country dishes and social gatherings . There lived a young girl of about nine or so , who was always dreaming of what was beyond her limits . Life held an unknown charm and she wanted to explore , wander the forests and hills , imagine different worlds . She felt a longing to venture off on her own , but was too afraid of what may lay beyond her tiny , sheltered village . One morning , she decided it was time to cross her buried ambitions out of her comfort zone of innocence . She grabbed a basket of supplies given to her by her patient parents , and set off on a journey beyond her expectations . Though the forests and hills were frightening , surprises she had never imagined awaited her around every nook and cranny . Hidden artifacts from mysterious worlds , cottages in enchanted villages , friendly face after friendly face . She excitedly daringly took chances , snowshoeing , stumbling upon frozen lakes , skiing down impossible slopes , learning how to drive a small motorbike and bike like a professional racer . Every day she found something to illustrate , something to speak to , something to photograph and share her journey with her bellowing family , their village proud to have an adventurous spirit . As the months went on , she knew she would return to her family in her beloved down , her treasured moments tangled delicately into her hair . But there were talents she found as she stepped up , experiences she wished no one would ever take away from her . Everyday , she tucked them away for safekeeping , a treasure of all that she found roaming these beautiful lands . She now carried more knowledge , bravery , confidence and a passionate curve of her nose . She was no longer afraid of the unknown , for the unknown was now her best friend and would forever remain .

After surrendering to these feelings and notions of wrong-doing , you begin to experience a sense of love and renewal . With tears of gratitude in your eyes , you greet yourself with a new resolve as you open the gates of Heaven .
Mabel and Marco marched across a vast desert with nothing else in sight . All that filled the sky were stars that flickered overhead , as though guiding them along their own cosmic path . Water glided in an invisible wake behind them like their own tailwind . It felt as though an invisible hand was whispering in unison as their feet pattered against the burning sand . A harsh wind blew against their faces and the stronger gusts threatened to send Mable and Marco rolling over the blistering sand dunes . But they powered on , never rest one moment for food nor rest . Despite the weight of their gear , both of them held onto dreams of a time long ago , when they connected through a single spark of light , before life ever had them from each other as they trekked toward foreign lands . And tho the sand slowly erased their each every footprint , their journey onwards would be creating memories to last an eternity , and beyond . time passed by lazily and melted away beneath the deserts brarthy moon , but their dreams holds fast as though marching in daylight , an unline march among stars between sunken ruins and majestic trees arising out of the desert and above time itself , standing in clockless wisdom , marking the mark of existence that can not be shared except with penand paper or kind in a whisper a longing for things that still exist , waiting to greet tho some slip away with faint sightings forgotten , fading gold and shadows elm but always they will talk and know the way never forgetting and together apart go walking . Stars winking along , swaying , they vowed they 'd never let the anger take control for this granted knowledge cements even the unwritten eternity they seek before outstretching grassland hugged their dusty toes , heavy framed motes glint across the twilight sun more sign of life ..

It was a time of unimaginable fear and loss . The nation convulsed , torn between pain and sorrow , the uncertainties of new threats around every corner yet tempered by a familiar sense of hope . Fear had invaded the land at one furious speed , losses piling in its shadow every day . Survival , at such moments , was far from certain , and big decisions were hard-pressed to be made between precious few silvers of hope . David Alan Walker , a 27-year-old man of substantial vision and determination sought meanwhile to build safety within a world in collapse amidst a lingering despair . Some dismissed the son of wealth as a half delusional visionary , pushing further his ambition to restore peace and reunite the co-members of faint ancestry . Others saw him only as some wanton lunatic , willfully striving against wicked demoniac fury from what seemed to be fruitless challenge . Yet at the bottom , beneath all this lies unspoken stories which kept muted about the magnificent battle that initially set off David Alan Walker 's improbable endeavors , and a perilous scene at the town 's top church ruins — the very spot where the world 's fragile fate unanimously unfolded . Widar County , a hitherto obscure business hub , today swelled suddenly in all the buzz and glory with rumors pertaining barely originated within but indeed split all corners of the faint yet gradually intensifying faith- like his pursuit of the evening 's short and dimly tomorrow in harmony with dread since there seemed to unlikely any good escape . As he crossed the bridge and eased his walk in what could become a fight for he very future — the bridge -- David felt an undeniable , soothing calm . People standing from a surging mass formed large pleasant arches symbolizing resonance of clouds in puffy shapes throughout himly- seen gleams of courgeous stamina stirring and tempting his pulses beyond supreme gauvin gazing temmes . Heavilly restless rain still hooved above , suddenly sinking beneath in an flusey barry mantle . But soon , omry soon ! optimism would return !
The crack of lightning and roar of thunder was the prelude to the unprecedented storm . Stinging hail one moment , gentle rainfall the next ; hysteria gripped townsfolk alike . Fires overset the city streets , crying out in fear while the cobbled walked ran red . Buried by waves of water , hopes diminished ; the world given back was one of despair . Wind ’ s curtain call bleated shrill and urgent once , no one could ignore its past ’ s warning . Yet against the clutch of destruction , tales lit of determination with Salvation ’ s spark . Rising from ash , Emerged .
Prologue She never thought anything was off about that day , October 2nd , 2037 . In fact , if Gabrielle Carter looked back on it she certainly would n't be able to find a marked difference between it the day that any other day held .

John used to spend hours daydreaming outside his window . Painting such beautiful illusions he wanted to make them real . Giving in to his desires he sorted out a plan . Dreaming of all the ways he would make it come alive . A wizard of modern techniques , who already engraved it into his mind . With swiftness and subtle elegance he proceeded as planned . In a calculated , respectful manner yielding suitable results . Wiping the sweat from his brow he could comprehend the masterpiece . Cobbled to perfection , boundless in its capacity . Gratification of workcraft manifested clearly proven . His curtains softly rose as he glanced , admired , and smiled . 'Whirr ' the hoisted platter in metaphorical agreement . Perfection .
At first , I didn ’ t understand why , but I felt a strange warmth emanate from the box when the donation of happiness was made . I cautiously reached out for it and when my hand touched it , I felt a wave of joy wash over me . It felt foreign and fragile , and yet I was intrigued . I held onto that feeling of joy from the wondrous donation , and found that I was better able to understand other people ’ s emotions through it . On some level , I even began to identify different patterns in people 's gestures , infers , and expressions fueled by different emotions . It was two dimensional at first , but slowly overtime as I soaked in different examples of illustrated emotional experiences , I started to recognize different layers and how they can still be interconnected . I also found that I was slowly able to form and elevate my own feelings by understanding someone else ’ s exchange and how it can affect them . The bigger chance it had a harmony on myself , creating endurance on any opposing situations where regret and sadness were present . Instead of making me cautious or do anything but cautiously chart beyond logic , rather , it made environment from which newfound joy is created by taking a back seat . Donations have kept my box full of various expressions and an understanding beyond pain and disagreement which I couldn ’ t before before . I find myself even more in touch with myself and others and I attribute this to the acts of generosity others have bestowed upon me . At night , the night sky feels like a million of donated emotions silently twinkling and I couldn ’ t be more gratefull .
Once upon a time there lived a little mouse who was brave and kind and set out on an adventure to explore the world . He started his journey by sneaking away from his home underground into the shimmering seashore across the glistening river lit by the golden moon . Nose twitching and brow furrowed , he marched on , day and night , over the spectacular multicolored mountains and looming hills . He scavenged for food , drank from streams , sung songs and told stories until reaching to the capital at the World Edge Cities . Here , he found a metropolis filled with streets and sidewalks bustling with Life ! So brightly colored it dazzled the little mouse ’ s eyes . A delightful marketplace filled with strange sights and exotic creatures singing and carrying on in loud chorus rolled with laughter and merriment .

From that day on , the greedy king of the mountain held an ambitious dream to explore the limitless horizon and followed the footsteps of a heroic little mouse into unprecedented discovery and worlds of endless details awaiting unto him .
She said she only loved him . It had been a tough battle - one full of tears , bouts of frustration , disappointment , resentment and guilt . He thought it was for love that she declared during the incessant arguing , only to realize afterwards that it was nothing more than stress speaking from both himself and her .

Trent Taylor ran through the sizzling alleyways of the City of Powers . His spirits were high - he was Rank 1 and it had been like this for years and no one quite knew why . Despite being the most powerful individual in the city , Trent kept his gift hidden , never revealing it even to his closest companions . The dominant landscape of the bartering system placed on Trent 's shoulders had become routines for him , altogether innocuous . He had been staying away most nights recently ; bartering and haggling away his goods on the black market . What no one knew was that Trent gained access to these unsavory concourses as a part of his carefully kept secret . Trent masked his power from the eyes of others as he moved quietly within tightly wired alleys and sheets of electricity pulsating around him . As he moved , he fed the flow of power hemming him in , gaining a greater surround message , a sensation of a calm serenity . Flooded in chaste peace , he ducked beneath the quick shower of dynamism chasing him every night in pursuit of power and recognition . Trent slumber counted the hours steadily every night while all of the storytellers , rank holders and market goers wover together hastily about his humble figure between arc webs spanning wide . The location was not a told secret . Strategically construed ideas multiplied rapidly while claiming power from the holder for power and challenges have materialized in Trent ’ s mouth . This new perceived sense was dictated by no one . Understanding the risk in its real form , he meant sincere ignorance of his power in order to remain out of others sight remains his strength . Although keeping detached displayed less impulssiivity and have unseen arrogance , Trent honed the abilities chained firmly to protection , enable him to toe his way breaking the smothering boundaries associated with gaining an honest rightful and proper placering Ordermanship . Ranked No . 1 being it humbly yet appropriately spoke alarms to the held imaginary beliefs from sources above where not just concepts like brutal savagery through chaotic assaults or marketing campaigns was contended or embalished prior ; now psychic powers try out its dominance respect , realizing that it represented the diversification by edating from virtually untemperable combined ideas flowing unitaryly . Dominate too much , lack communication skills even more and surpass organic rates in cognitive understanding - this is cost of turn around expectations . The hard truth have meant increase in
You stand across from your own figure and finally have the courage to face your fears , shortcomings and accept yourself , with all your imperfections and flaws . Every moment in your imperfect life had become an integral part of this remarkable and growth-filled journey , and you realize that without these experiences , you would be a hollow shell . Invite them to forgive and accept of yourself , just as you come to accept and forgive those differences in them . You exchange understanding and compassion , releasing years of wounds and dissolve into forgiveness , ready to receive that which has now returned to you tenfold . The love and grace you had been yearning to fill your whole existence with surges through you like an electric current . With a tide washing away tensions and reigniting in your an embrace , you find that acceptance - that path and permit to freedom . It 's Heaven .
It had been six years since they we had arrived in this city , adopted into a new home and a new lifestyle , a lifestyle full of people with powers , powers unseen to the normal people of the outside world . Everyone here was at a different realm of power ; from minor abilities able to move tiny mobile objects , to manipulating larger objects with pure thought , and sensitivity and skill beyond our wildest imaginations . All these different levels of power converged in the air here – it was an impressive sight to take in at first – and then someone decided to do something about these convergences the smart and rational solution , rank . Ever since I can remember eveyone has been weighted on the scale according to the power they possess ; a higher level of power landed you a higher force in the system and granted various titles of Ascendant and Ruler class of security force . Of course the hieirray was rarely without error and tantrums – anger and tempers flaring whenever it seemed something was askew especially since everybody wants to elevate themselves up but not anyone else up . It was quick reality every new day after my family had arrived heard when one heard cries of protests as a new head was strangers walked into my neighborhood and put into play replacing old familar faces ones from the exisitingsame cohort who still reflected memories fond ones older crowds gathering every night .

Paragraph one : Brendan trudged tiredly up Avenue D one war-torn autumn day , distracted by the devastation wreaked on his city by death , the constant gray daylight , and the hum of German artillery . If only Pearl Harbor had never been attacked ... Paragraph last : At dusk , exhausted and stained with tears and sweat , he felt a sense of quiet pride watching uniforms come alive with the glow of colorful state flags . Each well-earned stitch marked the patriotism and courage of the an inseparable 13 states that had resiliently withstood circumstances unprecedented in their young histories .
Last year 's time traveling death match , aptly named 'Kill Hitler ' was daunting , to say the least . With top time-travelers arriving from around the globe , none of us were truly prepared to go head to head in a battle of the most creative and outlandish methods of killing the infamous leader of the Third Reich . My plan : manipulate the space-time continuum to cause changes in fictional and real-world interconnected narratives by changing events created around the concept of war , propaganda and knowledge . By upstreaming Fiction Island at key junctures , one of which was draping the skyline of Berlin during the war . I made the invention fictional radioactive streaming surveillance nodes placed on the tops of tall buildings . Paired with advanced Bismarck robotics , both of which were waiting high in the sky from a secret train station located under Fuhrer bunker . The world famous 'Last Supper ' scenario ; already in play in the historical event of 'Assassination attempts ' . Each ofthose attempts and plans-within plansinnered the facade of former Nazi : no one expects robot drones I created using my upstreamed Fiction Island to do the viscious deed of taking down both targets . This s also released botants being breed underground in mines to prevent the Whermacht still fiercely holding their stance about their historic geography and military positioning to be taken out beforehand . The execution of [ Plan ______ ] was fought in battle as my robot forces manifested in battalions and mak small tactical mindgames against the overwhelming opposition of inner earthly , undermatd Nazi forces was fierce and time intensive , but the job had been done away ie wthe plan story drafted in my head .

Last year , I won the Time Traveler 's Game by perfectly executing a plan that made historical waves both subtle and monumental . Through personal conversations and careful positioning of items part of the state apparatus , I slowly and systematically created disruption and disinvestment in Germany during the 1930 's . Like a waterfall domino domino game , chaos full of surprise spread amongst formerly brazen loyalists of a dangerous regime . Armed only with biesmic energy and clever words quickly declared as I crisscrossed through time and space , I slowly caused seed populations concepts and trending social to burgeon so radically that a new national cognistiated arose from deep inside the closest tiers of FuhrerHitler 's captivated public sectors . Elections held that soon entailed were enormously swift and unprecedented historically reverated further dismantling of his horrorful rule . As sinister and twisted as his power structure was already with each of my whisper tune meltwater campaign points aligned tacticaly broader scicherati-inspired frenzy against codimination began in virulent dramamatic retaliation - as a legacy hasing all futuristic probability unfrust and altering die course further and urther down and out of totalitarian Germany . finally Hitlerian dark dreadful night lay dead behind as clouds resmerpled spanning freedom rainbowhigh !
Last year 's competition to kill Hitler presented many challenges , and I think everyone quickly realized they had to up their game to pull this off if they wanted to go home with the title of `` Champion Time Traveler '' ! To win , my strategy was to go back in time and kill Hitler with a mistake from his past so he would n't even realize that he had been killed , while still securing that I secured points from killing him as creatively as I could . Starting in 1945 , three months before Adolf Hitler would supposedly die in entanglement and shoot himself in a bunker , I decided to visit war year 1942 Germany . First , I crafted a forged identification document for a factory company salting-boxes for Nazi weapon supplies . It was very important to stay in Father 's garage ; step one succeeded , normal tracing out of time tracks was impossible to detect on me . Second , I decided to befriend a special group of soldiers who , for personal yet political purposes for him , refused all the orders sent regarding Hitler ’ s will . I mixed two entertaining elements , Berlin but Big Secrets ; Step two succeeded , ensuring my safety near the Fuhrer by means of alliances , political contamination avoided , and eternal friend while the madness was pushed further and further by . At last , and quite unintentionally for him , assuming existing tactics ( ! big evil Plan in process preparing Ardennes Offensive at that time ) behind all the tragic and sorrowful means employed US managing to teach literally hard lesson for once Triumphal Head , I instantly held that chance for my Mission , simply applying Law ‘ Once bitten by Luck fish , be wiser this time ' . It took near no time with critical success ! Enemy did not asleep aware , but failure nearly equalous destruction for plan conceived , except historical regression in face , precisely ... bloody facts were changed ! Congratulations Round three- , set materials and charge in row . I mustered millions soldiers to bomb it on Omens himself if ever ! Obviously as future says , denied either way . Card game so devious weapon and time resistance proved difficult manipulating possible releases of misinformation which shook silence and commended knowledge stored whenever chance applied . Succeeded fourth turn hit and game won twice last resource totally despaired and adapted decisions made had hit zero to opponents believing it unfeasible . In one master adventurous attempt my tactics successfully changed then globally applicable outcomes and , as it told formerly record so expiated immortality ! And
Danny crammed the last box into the small locker of his train compartment . Canting his head to the side , he tried to assess if there was any more space he could squeeze into . With resolution - perhaps a tad too forcibly - he declared it full , turning his attention to the enthusiastic whistle which had punctuated the cool night air ever since they 'd left the station some quintuple minutes of 10 seconds ago . Despite having disregarded then subsequently delayed accounting for it , an intense sense of intuition weighed heavily in Danny 's mind . His conjectural anxiety increased extra with relief and inexperience further instructed the impression , colored uneasy that his next 16 hour journey into the unknown calls to him in tender encouragements yet hopeful repositions . Fumbling whatever bag handles his fingercontact waved entrancingly within , he drank in to drown the tense dangers arching up through any crook in the window 's curtain facade . He humbly scanned every deeper endoround into an abbreviate curio poking past wary grounds , noting facet attentively that most which warrant be fear , beset firmly with a needed shine in all nearby soils .

As you slowly walk up to confront your mirrored reflection , you can feel your heart pounding and guilt consuming your whole being . You want to look back , to escape this moment of unmistakable accountability , but you can not . You have to face yourself for all of your actions and wrongdoings . You try to say something , to find some sort of resolution before you reach healing or enlightenment , but no words come out beyond painfully muffled sobs that feel like your soul is shaking out of place . Finally , against all odds , you lift your head and hold your gaze . You look towards the broken person you are yet , drawing strength from the sorrow , learn to forgive yourself in a moment of epiphany . You feel your body lighting up and slowly levitating towards the heavenly utopia -- your entry pass to a realm of color and beauty , of liberation and summer daydreams . Swallowed by the music of happiness carried away by lush wildflowers taking pigment in red , yellow , and gold , you are discharged in a pinch of inner peace . You alone are in control , you alone own your story .

I won the championships last year by executing my most daring scheme : using time travel to rewrite Hitler 's personal life story . My scheme ran exactly like this : I traveled back in time one right to the birthplace of Adolf Hitler and tampered with the historical records . Initially , I carved out a fictional family portrait with a single father absent of any Jewish behavior or heritage . Then , I replaced at least one parent ’ s portrait with someone of Eastern European Jewish inspired genetics . After scrubbing through active membership population records in the area , I 'm sure most would think that I was playing histrologist and genetic roulette . After several attempt I was successful in swappinv one set of parents for another . Knowing that the historic Bible and its marriages provided key opportunity times which supported these changes that in perspective seem like adolescent behaviors , modifictionibts probably much ieasier to avoid complete fictionizationo society ’ s liewweight police then most wouldbe most peopler in 1938 PruralGermany with 1930 Censusc illusive demographics but really much lived on as mather of documents updated fasterthan theories couldwas evaluate inevitable results and predict change of political sceneof western civilization ..

It was something that Sarah was feeling all week . A certain nag of worry about what was to come . She left home early that Sunday and had no idea that her world would be flipped upside-down by the day 's end . Frantic waves of fear rolled through her body until she could n't tell up from down , wrong from right or comfort from chaos . The rush of every single moment eventually hugged her , like a full-length succulent novel finally fading into its satisfying and hard-anticipated conclusion . A spark of understanding hummed through her core and she knew then , that things would never be the same .
But saying goodbye was the toughest decision I had to make . Tears filled my eyes as the clock struck ten , uncaring of why I was sorrowful then . Even though I followed what logic said , nothing could explain the shades of colour — red . Best friends forever was what we proclaimed — alas , life moved on , this was not sustained . Walked till mile one by precisely half , I had dreamt of this moment ; I dreaded the day it comes to laugh . Sobbed into my palms and God was the thankful one , little did He know he was the luck one . Uncertainty eased us and heartbeats started to freeze Kisses fled , time arrested steadily , packed and said adios with instant ease . The mountains roared to cry along with me ; echo waning quickly answered alongside — Goodbye .
Jon and Zach had been counting down the days for weeks - the snowboarding trips during winter break was all either one of them had talked about for months . They were like brothers / best friends , sharing the same adventurous spirit . They dove into the new experienced with crazed abandonment , and suddenly their minds rest were no longer taken up with thoughts of schedules and numbers , but pow turns and blank runs . Of clear , untrevelled snow and sharp mountain air . Despite ignoring all their worries they lived on a perfect level of intensity throughout days before making the journey painfully-but-joyfully back home - a little worn from the incredible journey and surrounded by would-forgotten trophy film packages .

As sad as it may be , it 's inevitable - time has come for us to part from one and another and move on in life . I 'm always going to remember the times we had together , laughing , exploring so many wonderful things , singing upturned faces towards skies as paint swirled stars above . There may be a distance what with you being so fa away but I 'm always going to be one loving voice in the shadows of time that will outlive reminiscence , where increasingly more ordinary the everyday will forever carry a twing of tears missing the strays of our days gonegone byy .

As children transition out of their early childhood years and explore their independence , our role in their young lives transitions as well . While it may be difficult for either of us , this will be an opportunity- an opportunity for both of us to grow before eventually moving into a state of detachment within a completely different context as our adventure launches us both off into bigger objectives and purpose . Encourage , edify , celebrate , grieve and uncover , uncertain realities . Emphasize the new path already designed before giving us the ultimatum wave us each good luck and farewell . You may be fading away , but remember to make this transition with lots of engagement as to maintain a strong sense of presence during this critical moment of emerging concepts and memories . Seek solace in glimpses of flashes : a recurring reminder of vibrancy once experienced and of beauty you were honored with even past becoming unseen .

The moment I opened my donation box and saw the word `` happiness '' , I felt a sudden feeling of warmth taking over . I was a little uncertain because I had never felt the emotion before , but I was deeply curious . Against all my mixed curiosity and trepidation I hung onto that small spark of sensation , and gradually it blossomed into more . The radiant presence of this action filled me with an incredible warmth . It expanded inside my heart and lit a flame of deep joy . An unfamiliar wave of pleasure engulfed me . As I felt its delight ; I wept for the first time from the sheer beauty of being filled with this sorely-missed emotion . This marked the beginning of a happier life full of comfort , relief , solace , and untimed joy . A glad life with satisfaction and elation . Where celebrations did n't feel forced or awkward but anything just released a genuinel flow of cheer and satisfaction . It felt like my world was sparkling with innocence almost instantly . My long lives course of sorrow had just come to an advance .

I had been preparing for that day for as long as I can remember . It was do or die time and so I I filled every waking hour planning for unpredictable scenarios . But the moment I stepped through that great Mahogany door nothing seemed to go my way .

Estimates were reflected shortly as the rapturous crowd joyfully anticipated new policy reveal . Worry surfaced amongst the politicians as concerned chirps bounced up and down the audience . Synapse twitching with vigorous nerves speaking facts , Chairman advised pupils on best possible speech . Suddenly , inflamed observers lashed out against unreasonable plan causing pandemonium . Reiterating promise to unite , he waged for silence and unbreakable attention . Lies had brewed vast discontent whose distorted dregs culminated tonight . Debate embodied blind accusation among feelings now sourly snide . Passions erupted crescendo-depth displayed undeniable crisis alive . Rejecting course tacticians spun forward into preordained rallying hour . Trigger let off , flashes radiate redemption granting trembling citizens courage and power . Alive .
Inquisitive beyond his years , Pippen found behind their house amidst broken tree stumps and piles of shoveled dirt a peek into formidable cloaked worlds far removed from the problems filling his life . In enthrallment , nearly oozing off of him , he quietly forced open a thick rusty gate earthed with carbonized time and uncovered a highly inquisitant reality of fire lizards , pinting waters , and mushroom caterpillars meandering through stained parahampers of gold and silver . Giving in to the experience unleashing in front of him , Pippen did n't answer when his mother 's question tricycled back down the world 's concurrence , only rarely able to track her son amidst the rag lands she often seized to anchor feigned blaiffs . With not merely a day 's demands looming , Pippen was nevertheless amidst the cascading shadows erupting no filter before him and no assurance that would react with normal rational procedure . ( Focus on contrast and comparison eistered emotions urging comportment unusual amazement . Wonderland ambush -- take it away ! ) .

Once upon a time , there was a little girl named Jasmine . She was born into a life of privilege - with two parents who showered her with love , an elite private school education , and boundless access to her every whim . If Jasmine wanted a pony , she would get it . If she wanted designer clothes , her parents would n't hesitate . Nothing it seemed , was off limits to the young girl––and nothing in her life really made good reason for her to worry or grow how afraid . In-fact all banal adulthood matters like Career aspirations or late night shifts confounded polite conversation and dinners with her ridiculously wealthy upper-cruscrie family circle . But unknown to these higher ups in society wrapping him up in price jewelled security – there was resident darkness and danger where it knew none .

When Jasmine noticed the first fractal seeds of harmonic gravity

This winter morning was unlike none Linda had experienced before . The city had suddenly become individual outlines against a white terrain . Frozen whisper ambulated through falling snow and there were places that she could attempt to tread ; faint old forgotten songs drowned far below flake . But Linda had a pilgrim knowledge that whispered there might be personified pauses waiting unheard ; lands that whispered life was waiting to be refurbished in the blue glims against purity surrounding a surreal audience . Subary souls received not lived life , they questioned over answered awakeness with laughter squashing burning flinth residue .

He moved around downtown Raleigh , unsteady in the thick mid-day traffic that converged centripetally around cafés lined neatly shoulder-to-shoulder . He had swapped heavy medical textbooks for paperback dictionaries , borrowing small grants for one last chance to make a bridge to that path so often trapped behind boardrooms and bean-counting analytics .

That makes me so sad . It 's always hard to see someone you care about grow and change . I guess part of this process is that it alters relationships and affects certain parts of them . As their best friend and companion , I will never forget the laughs we had together or all the soothing moments that let them cry without being judged . I 'm always here if you need an emotional hug – do n't ever forget the good times that we shared . That 's the greatest gift you can leave me with long after our times together have ceased .

As your kid gets older , it gets harder and harder for them to believe that you , as an imaginary friend , have experiences with them day by day . Even though it hurts knowing I 'm being forgotten and pushed aside , I 'm thankful for all of the joyous and silly times we shared whenever I was invited to your kid 's playing . Even if I 'm fading away now , we both got chance to laugh , joke , and remember the silly sayings during our countless childhood moments and stories .

John and Joelle had been together for years and up until that point , they we thought to be made for each other .

By forgiving yourself for every mistake you ever made , listening and accepting all your faults while showing compassion for yourself and not being overwhelmed by anger , racism , judgments , or disappointing culture views , freeing your soul of remorse , rewoking trust by essential spirit , becoming the best of what you are already—something magical happens . You brought joy back from pain , you found Heaven by believing in yourself .
Sleep Paralysis A golden-crowned kinglet performs an exclusively curated melody for my listening pleasure as similarly sun-drenched light cascades through my open window , down onto my now fluttering eyelashes , where the dewdrops that formed overnight begin to disperse into the song-heavy air , slow and sure towards the ceiling and beyond to rejoin the clouds from which they came . Full stop . Rewind the tape . Eject the cassette . Put it back in the case until later . Remember , you are not dreaming anymore . My room is pitch black , and I ’ m sure as hell not sleeping with my window open because it 's colder than satan 's tit outside ; ergo , all the birds have abandoned me to a song-less silence without so much of a closing chirp for someplace and someone warmer . I envision me , a tiny hitchhiker , strapped onto a downy avian back with the wind gusting my red nose raw , but that ’ s a fantasy I can ’ t indulge in until later . I reluctantly inhale reality , but it ’ s like breathing through a straw ; it ’ s sufficient , but my lungs still heave , unsatisfied . As if on cue , triggered by my stumbling into a rabbit hole of thoughts not meant for a morning filled with responsibilities and time schedules , the ‘ Drink Me ’ ding of my coffee pot ’ s auto-brew setting simplifies my decision-making process . Looks like another day of partial asphyxiation lies ahead , and the possible consequence of brain damage due to oxygen deprivation is to be dealt with at a later time . In the present , I abruptly snap up into a sitting position , ripping off the delicious haze of sleep like a bandaid . A crumped mass of dingy white sheets and accompanying duvet lay useless at my feet , and I stare at them resentfully , the goosebumps on my bare legs bristling abrasively at their betrayal . I shiver violently , but being nonsentient , the bedcovers do not reply . I don ’ t know why I continue to pick them up every morning , carefully retucking and relayering , when I am fully aware that I will just fight them off as soon as I pass into unconsciousness later in the day . Still , routine is comforting , and also , it ’ s not their fault I ’ m addicted to opiates that cause restless sleep , lucid dreaming , and vivid night terrors . I can ’ t blame a few inanimate objects for the massive problem that is my spiral into this shitty life where the only thing I can look forward to when I wake up in the morning is counting down the hours until I can go back to sleep . I set a timer on my watch and check it obsessively until I can leave my miserable minimum wage job , get onto my rickety old bike , ride home to my mediocre apartment , and swallow the little pink capsules that are my salvation . I check the clock as often as possible and think of their texture : strong but smooth against my teeth and tongue and throat , an intimacy and sensuality any other lover can not provide . Enough melodramatics . I stand up . I make the bed . I imbibe an appropriate amount of caffeine and calories . I go to work and perform in a satisfactory manner . I ponder how I have let this robotic efficiency become my waking life . The answer is already waiting , though , as it always is . When your dreams are so vivid , so expansive , so alive , the restraint of consciousness is so suffocating and unappealing that morning sickness almost always accompanies it , except it becomes afternoon sickness , and evening sickness , until the alarm I set goes off and the nausea is swallowed down with the pills . It ’ s like when you ’ re on a road trip to somewhere you really want to go to , but it ’ s really far away and you get really carsick and you ’ re in the back seat and you feel like you ’ re going to throw up for the whole twelve hours , but you endure it anyways because you really , really want to get to where you ’ re going , and you don ’ t even want to pull over to puke because that would make the drive longer , and you really can ’ t wait a second more because you ’ re so excited you feel like you ’ re going to die . Like a supernova sun collapsing in on itself , the anticipation fuels and consumes me , and the vastness of the universe , in its celestial benevolence , is kind enough to hide the intensity of my existential paradox ; at some point or another , when I am done destroying myself and all the galaxies within my reach , I will finally burn out to nothingness , forever , and then I can finally not just sleep , but rest , inside the void I have created . Sometimes , I wonder if I ’ ll dream , there , too .
It has been six weeks and the sounds will not leave . They came to me first in a dream , only when I woke , they did n't go away . They have been getting louder as well , rising from a faint echo into the beating drum that is tearing me apart . The doctor thought it could be a form of tinnitus but I could tell he was grasping at straws . What I did n't tell the doctor about was the voice . He first whispered to me the day after the noise appeared , at first I was n't even sure I had heard anything . Then it came again , loud and clear . `` Help me '' that is all it would say , help me , over and over again . As the doctor could do nothing for me and life must go on I attempted to reassemble myself back into the usual routine of life . Just now with the constant companion of unwanted chaos beating down my senses day by day , and the voice that would never go away . You do n't realize what a gift silence can be until it is denied to you . Alcohol quickly join the social circle of myself and my voice , in many ways their respective noises cancelled each other out leaving me in an unwitting stupor I was happy to indulge . It was on a Saturday night that something finally gave . I was out at the bar socializing with my two new friends when one of them spoke up with an unusual vigor A crescendo of noise that released into a scream in my skull `` *HELP ME* '' . Surely someone must have heard that , I glanced about to see who may have been made aware and sure enough there was one . A man relatively nondescript , the kind you glance at and dismiss just as quickly . The only issue with that was he was looking directly at me . What was I to do ? I glanced away , not meeting his eyes . It was n't as if I could ask him if he could hear the voice in my head , what might he think of me . Still , as he left the bar I felt compelled to follow him , maybe in the relative solitude of the roadside something would be made clearer . When I emerged outside it seemed a world away from the realm of chaos I had just left . It became clear the the man was waiting for me . He beckoned me over with a gesture , his visage shrouded by the smoke coming from a cigarette he had lit . Finally , I thought , I 'm getting somewhere , hopefully this man had some answers I desperately needed . I gathered myself for the truths to come and walked to his side , `` So , uh- '' `` do n't '' He said abruptly , `` In fact , fuck off , I do n't need you meddling in this business '' `` What ? '' I tired to reply but he was already walking across the street . I hear a noise behind me and glanced away it was at this moment that I was once again gifted with the sweet rush of silence , sweet relief . I turned back to the road and the man was gone . No , wait , there he was , lying face down in a quickly spreading pool of blood . I rushed to his side , as I reached him I saw his chest rising faintly , I knelt down close enough to make out two final word before the last of his breath rattled out of him . `` Help me '' . I was frozen . I sat there replaying the scene in my head , when I became aware of a faint noise and a voice `` You 're next ''
The pitch black sky split open with an earthshattering roar as the waves battered either side of the ship , causing it to lurch violently with every rolling crest . The scattered seamen battled ferociously with the rigging , wild ropes whipping furiously through the air as the wind screeched furiously around them . In the midst of the mayhem , a woman huddled , limbs tied together to the mast ; neither in the way nor helping she whimpered with every sudden pitch and roll of the waves . `` She 's bad luck , I 'm telling yer . Why d'you have to bring 'er ? '' Two men shouted to one another over the howling of the wind and the creaking of the ship as she struggled to stay upright in the raging storm . `` She i… my si…er , could n't ve.. ell leave … behind …ravaged ….merican savages ! '' Half of his words were lost to the wind 's voice as the deck tilted dangerously to one side . `` …El she'll…..ave to… . '' His words were swallowed as he pulled the woman – girl , really- to the railing , casting her , legs still bound , over the side . The roaring of the waves , the screeching of the wind and her brother 's broken scream swirled around her as she fell , terrified , into the churning depths below . Weighed down by her already sodden skirts , her entire body seemed to shatter from the impact of hitting the freezing water as she was instantly swept under by the rampaging current . She could think of nothing but how damnably cold it was , and how her poor mother was going to take it if only one of her beloved children returned . Everything went black as she sank deep into the churning water and the ship continued her laboured journey through the storm . She woke to darkness . At least she assumed she woke up . At first she thought she was dead , but the cold had permeated her bones and saturated her skin , her very bones seeming to scream in frozen agony ; nowhere in the bible did it say she would be cold in death . Fire , she had been expecting , burning in eternal damnation had seemed almost pleasant . Throughout her short life , she had been cold . Coal had cost too much , and the lord of the manor would have overlooked it had she been older and more… willing to his advances . Hatred swirled through her , hot and heady , warming her chilled , broken bones . The ocean as it swirled around her seemed to whisper to her , encouraging her hatred of the man , spreading warmth from her heart around her body , easing the pain . Sorrow touched her as she thought about her mother , left to fend for herself . Whilst her brother cared for her in his way , only she knew what her mother needed and when . Leaving her had been one of the most painful things she had ever done , and it was her brother 's fault that their mother was going to be left alone . Thinking of her brother led her to his crew mates . Bastards , the lot of them . They 'd tried to force her , on their first night at sea . She 'd refused , and her brother had come by , hearing her panicked screams as they had forced her legs apart . Anger and malice coursed through her , sending a tingling through her body , from the crown of her head to the very tips of her toes , leaving her painless . She experimentally twitched her fingers in front of her , opening her eyes properly . The storm still raged above her , the cresting waves seeming to devour each other greedily as lightning split the sky and illuminated her surroundings . She was surrounded . A hundred beings hung , transfixed , in the water , just looking at her in her ripped dress , corset in rags and her legs still bound . Their pale , otherworldly skin seemed to glow in the faint light of the lightning , shimmering green and blue in the murky half-light . She turned suddenly , flicking her head to the side as the beings glided towards her . Closing her eyes tightly as they drew near , she screamed as their ghostly hands roamed over her broken body , untangling her hair . Softly , their hands caressed her skin , soothing and healing her battered bones , untying her legs and gently removing the remnants of her dress , running their hands down her legs until she felt them meld together . They whispered to her , asking her name and who had caused her such harm . Telling her she could not find her revenge . Whispering that perhaps , perhaps , she might be able to avenge the next girl . Her worries faded into nothing as hatred consumed her . Those men ; all men . They were responsible for her death . She knew now , that men were evil . They had thrown her to her death . Using her pretty face , her haunting , salt roughened voice and the wonderful freedom her tail had given her , she would repay the favour . They would suffer as she had suffered . She would lure them to their deaths .
The ground stank of garbage and the various chamberpots that had been emptied into the alley . Furtive movement bespoke vermin searching for food and I could hear the screech of their claws . I had n't eaten in three days . When had I last had something to drink ? Crawling toward the mouth of the alley I flinched as something skittered across my foot . I had n't always been this way . No , once I 'd lived in a castle , been a young lord . That was before . Before the Duke led a rebellion against the King . Before he 'd murdered my father . Escape had n't been a blessing , only a burden . I should 've just let them kill me , take off my head like they 'd done with father . Then at least the end would have been swift . The street beyond was bright and people laughed and talked oblivious , as I had been , to the pain and suffering only feet away . I watched them go , too weak to move anymore . My body ached and my stomach gurgled , begging for food . I flinched back as a troop of guards in gleaming gold etched breastplates trotted past . They did n't see me . I laughed hoarsely . Even if they had , they would n't know me as the Prince . Shoving myself up I stumbled into the street , toward the town gate . People avoided me , some ladies lifting handkerchiefs or fans to their faces . I sneered . Days ago they would have been begging me for a favor , for a glance . Now , I was vermin . I struggled , my body protesting movement , demanding food . I tripped and fell sprawled in the dirt before the gate . Soldiers nearby laughed . I fought the urge to glare at them as I pushed myself up and stumbled out into the grass on the other side . Out of the dust and press of people I collapsed beside the edge of a field , bordered on its other side by the wood . I looked at the dark wood , its shadows reaching toward me across the field . I rolled my head looking back to what had once been my castle on the hill . The banner of Duke Tricos flew there now , the gold stitch visible in the bright noon light . Rolling over I stumbled toward the dark forest . The wave of cool moist air swallowed me up as I stepped into the shadows . Even just beyond the edges all the sounds of the town faded . Here the sounds were different and without a horse beneath me and a bow in hand they were more sinister . Scrambling deeper still I found a bush covered in half-ripened Milkwort berries , bitter but not poisonous and they were food . I gathered them into a pouch formed from the front of my shirt and tied it in a knot before scrambling under the uncovered roots of a nearby Skeleton tree . Leaning against dirt that supported the trunk I ate the berries slowly . Too fast and I 'd be sick . Garil had always warned of that when he 'd trained me . Go without food or water and you needed to be careful when next you had them . The berries were awful , but eased the ache in my stomach and the juice , even bitter , was a welcome moisture . Something moved beyond my tree and I froze . Carefully I peeked around the roots . In the berry bushes before me sat a huge Brecar . It 's claws were wrapped around the berry branches , pulling them to its mouth as it ate . I stared , frozen . I would be dinner if it found me .
WARNING : will be shorter than most . No real plot either , just a 'day in the life ' story . Set in the SVU-verse and the *Eyes Turned Skyward* universe . May 1995 Most days , Billie Wakefield woke up with a dry feeling in her mouth . No worries : Dr.Yarbrough at the Big Mesa Clinic had told her that that situation was normal to most , if not *all* , pregnant women . Billie was 5 months along . At 7 every morning , Billie , Liz , Jessica , Nina , and Alex ate breakfast at the Box Tree Café on Hillcrest Drive,25 minutes from campus . Billie always ordered French toast , scrambled eggs , and regular milk . *Always* . The girls would usually talk shop . Boys , shopping , clothes , Billie 's pregnancy , that hot new TA in American History , and ( when Byron came sometimes ) Star Trek : TNV . Billie 's morning classes were American History , Film Criticism 101 , and a linguistics elective in Patman North . These were easier than you 'd expect and gave her time to think . To gather energy for the rest of the day and beyond , energy she would need when the twins were little . At 12 noon , Billie met Steven , Mike , Byron , and Bruce for lunch at Joe 's Ristorante , one of the campus 's few restaurants . Billie 's usual order was the *tostada* with buttercream and marinara sauce , and Grampa Geno 's Famous apple cider to drink . Billie 's afternoon classes were similarly easy . Sociology gave her more time to think , to listen to Professor Lannister , one of the shortest guys in the state , talk about how the Cold War had affected the thinking of youth . Billie always loved it when Mr.Lannister recited another anecdote about his father , a famous tank commander in Vietnam . Appreciation of Music helped her in a practical way , because Dr.Yarbrough had told her that her twins could hear the music even though they were still in her belly . Comparative Data Analysis was something Billie could 've done without , but Ned Wakefield had recommended it . He said that he 'd taken a similar class at Michigan State , and it had been 'cool ' . Besides , what young bride wants to get into her father-in-law 's bad graces ? Although truth be told , Ned did love her . After all , when she and Steven had gotten married in December , he 'd been the second person , after Steven himself , to dance with her . At 6:30 PM , Billie , Liz , Steven , and Todd met for dinner at Casey 's Place , which was catty-corner to the eastern campus gate . For dinner , Billie always ordered hot dogs , mac and cheese , pickles , and water . And for dessert , pound cake with a Granny Smith apple on top , a Casey 's special since 1963 . After that , Billie finished up her day with an hour in the Daeron Dayne Library . Usually , she 'd transcribe her notes and study for tomorrow . Then she would go home , ( which meant the Western Dormitory , Edros Tully Memorial Wing , ) shower , brush her teeth , change into that baby blue shift with the sunflowers , and fall asleep in Steven 's arms , knowing that the same routine would continue for at least another couple of months . Which meant , of course , that life was good . *Finis*
**No title yet . ** Been working on this for a while and getting nowhere . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Hilt couldn ’ t believe that people actually lived like this , so confined and restricted . She ’ d arrived in the city barely an hour before and was still having trouble coming to terms with her surroundings . The journey itself had not been especially arduous once she got the hang of traveling by ship , there had been the initial few days of seasickness , but she eventually adjusted . Her horse , Full-Sprint , had a more miserable time however . At first he ’ d been excited by the constant supply of hay and various fruits and vegetables , but once the ship had cast off it was clear that he was not a horse that enjoyed being confined to such a small area for an extended period of time . The horse was a huge , white , fussy bastard of a thing who couldn ’ t stand anything slower than a run and kept trying to convince Hilt that she should let him . A horse that used to running freely across the land was never going to enjoy being kept below the deck of a dwarven fishing and transport ship . But it was the quickest way for them to reach Koryal Ruskal , so there was little choice in the matter . They could have been dropped off at the border between Hynyezemryae and Frár Andail , but the ride from the Dwarflands to the elven capital would have taken weeks by horse , and from what Hilt had learned , the mass migration that was taking place made the journey far too hazardous . So , instead of the days journey it would take them to travel to the Dwarven Divide , they instead opted for the two week journey along the warm summer currents directly to the Koryal Ruskal docks themselves . And so there Hilt walked , leading Full-Sprint through the noise and bustle of the fish market with the sea breeze at her back while she tried to regain her land legs . She was wearing a pair of hand-stitched leather shoes , a gift from her clan-brother Savi , given to her when she left the island along with several other gifts given to her by the rest of her clan as they ’ d said their goodbyes She hated footwear , finding the covering uncomfortable , but Savi had insisted she would need them . Looking at the muddy road that lay ahead of her farther into the city , Hilt began to understand why . The sheer amount of noise on the docks was almost offensive to her , having grown up more accustomed to the silence and isolation of island life , to the point where she felt the amount of people and noise around her was almost draining her of energy . The number of people turning to look and stare at her as she passed was hardly surprising . In fact , she had been told to expect it . Apparently an orc that wasn ’ t a sellsword was a rare sight , a blonde orc even more so , to the point where after a moment Hilt was forced to stop and pull her hood over her head . She ’ d been cautioned not to draw too much attention to herself , but that was easier said than done . Regardless , she had a job to do , for the Sarramitbar brothers and for herself . Finding what the dwarf brothers were looking for would be the easiest to do , as she knew where to start and it would likely help her start to find her own way . With that in mind , Hilt set out looking for the nearest stable . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - The stench of civilization filled Kavec ’ s senses as he neared the city gates . It was unmistakable to those who knew it and to those who didn ’ t , they could be forgiven for mistaking the smell with that of an animal pen . It was largely due to the amount of waste in the outer districts , but behind that there was the smell of smoke . Of cooking food , burning wood and smelting . In fact , Kavec had thought to himself on numerous occasions that the only difference between the lower districts and a cattle yard was the fire . He was barely a mile from the main gate with the damned setting sun shining in his eyes , but the stench was still strong , owed largely to the fact that the easterly ocean breeze coming in off the coast was blowing it straight towards him . He wouldn ’ t have been surprised if that was an intentional feature agreed upon by the more central upper districts with the blessing of the royal court so that they neither would have to deal with presence of the lower districts any more than they already had to . Nevertheless , he was home , for all the good that did him . He tried to avoid the capital as much as possible , opting to work further inland where he transported goods between the local farms that had set themselves up along the east river , but the recent drought had forced him and others back here . The weather was infamously erratic during these years , with winter , spring and even summer lasting months longer than anyone anticipated , to the point that winter would suddenly strike mid-year while summer sometimes wouldn ’ t come until years end . It would be several more years before the seasons righted themselves again , or at least as close to righted as they could get . Typically the more stubborn farmers would stay behind , since most of them came from families that had been working the land for several generations and knew the tricks they needed to keep their crops healthy and livestock fed . Everyone else tended to relocate to the coastal cities though , where the rivers weren ’ t as dry and the ocean traders took full advantage of the influx of inlanders . The next few years would be especially hard however . There were more inlanders making their way to the Elfland capital of Koryal Ruskal this year than any previously . The lower districts were cramped enough to begin with and already Kavec could already see the effects of the inlander migration . Tents and makeshift homes were hastily built around the exterior of the city walls , making Kavec glad that he had organized accommodation months ago . He ’ d only been young during the last Long Seasons and had n't had to work through the hardships they presented , but he ’ d organized an arrangement with an old acquaintance for work down on the docks , moving the hauls from the ships to the upper and lower district markets . The fact that he was even considered for the job was helped in no small part by the fact that he owned his own cart and horse , which he suddenly found himself grateful for considering he ’ d likely need to expand his route to the outer wall , especially if the outliers had set up their own stalls . The city gates were wide open as he approached , which was hardly surprising . Only a fool would try to attack the capital with anything less than half the peoples of a neighboring continent . And even then , no one was brave enough to attempt something so suicidal , not after the resolution of the Orc Uprisings more than a century before . Even now as he approached the gates , Kavec could see a few orcs here and there , likely sellswords hired to guard some of the families and caravans that had made their way to the capital . The Long Seasons were notorious for the increase in highwaymen skulking along the roads , aiming to rob some of the less guarded caravans . Regardless , the orcs tended to stay on their own , never in more than groups of two or three . They didn ’ t want to be confused as conspirators against the crown . Of course , all that would change when they made their way back inland once their services were no longer required . It was much more difficult to police the barbarian tribes than the outer city walls , not to mention that a few opportunistic greenskins would likely try to band together to rob any of the late-comers in an attempt to make some extra coin . That was orcs in a nutshell ; paid bodyguards to one caravan , cursed highwaymen to another . Kavec wrinkled his nose as he approached the gate . Sometimes he didn ’ t know what smelled worse , the city or the orcs . At least lower district slummers seemed to bathe . The orcs almost always reeked of months-old body odor with greasy , tangled black hair , usually worked into dreadlocks that were tied back with an old strip of leather and scraggly , close cut facial hair that typically looked like it was cut with a dull dagger , which it probably was . Kavec could barely tolerate green swine on a good day , and he certainly wasn ’ t in any sort of good mood at the moment , not with the sun still in his eyes . A guard waved him through the gate without even bothering to shake him down for goods and coin , not out of laziness but out of recognition . There was only one family in Koryal Ruskal that owned horses with the brand his carried . Cutter , his horse , was not unique . He was a sturdy beast with light brown colouring across its body , mane and tail with white , feathered hooves , but he was Kavec ’ s horse nevertheless and the closest thing Kavec had to a friend when he was on the road . Cutter handled himself well as he pulled Kavec and his cart through the city gates apart from the occasional snort , which Kavec could hardly blame him for . The stench of discarded scrap and dumped waste was almost overwhelming now that they were within the city walls and the increased traffic had turned the roads to mud , which was made all the more disturbing when you stopped and considered how long it had been since it had rained . Past the gates however there were less orcs and more people . He spotted a few dwarves , typically working the stalls or peddling other wares and at one point he thought he caught sight of an elf , but given how far they were from the upper districts it was more likely a halfer . Making his way to the stables , Kavec closed his eyes and took in the sights and sounds of the city and found himself reminded of why he rarely came back here .
I wrote this story in Middle School but I always wanted to share it ... So here it is . I hope u enjoy . Sandeep the Psychopath Sandeep was once a good boy who always respected his parents and everyone he knew . He was beloved in the community because he was a world renowned light weight kabaddi champion ( Pretty much when people wear underwear and fight in mud over a sock . ) Sandeep had his final challenge to beat the universal weight champion and he was known throughout the milky way glass . The champions name was Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta . Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta was 3261432947691642396142384 years old . He hasn ’ t been beaten since the creation of the sun . He has 124623654 kids . All his kids died before he was born . Before the match both of them were given an oil massage to smooth up there skin . They were going to fight at one of the most prestigious battle domes in the milky way glass . The fight usually lasted for 2000 years and a human being has never attended it . So Sandeep the champion was called after the relaxing oil massage . All his baby fat formed again . He also got super powers he can fly and shoot lasers out of his nose . The messenger then took him to the final training dome which was made out of the most expensive chocolate made from purified unicorn milk . The battle dome also had several glasses of milk from the super-fast giant golden awesome camel that can go faster than the speed of light . He can also milk himself which means produces unlimited amounts of milk . For all the divine floating babies to drink . They are very young and dependent . The fight was set to start in 30 years . Sandeep trained hard for 15 years and watched bollywood dramas for the next 15 years . Then came the time for the big match . A transporter from one of the very little known white hole lying just outside of a black hole outside of space and time . The messenger then took them to the battle dome . This battle dome was made out of purified cardboard . With a sandbox in the middle of the match . Also over there Zeus , Horace , Poseidon , Beerus ( God of destruction ) , Goku ( Super Saigon God ) , Vamana , Brahma , bottle of hellman ’ s mayonnaise and many others . Every final match there was a sacrifice among the god directed to the divine babies also known as Hamzah Qadri ’ s . Last time The Divine Bottle of Hummus was sacrifced . This time the gods voted on Goku but there was a tie between him and Hellman ’ s mayonnaise . The babies were to choose between the two . They chose goku and when Hamzah Qadri himself tried eating Goku he exloded and a supernova formed . All the gods excluding Goku , Beerus , and Hellman ’ s mayonnaise died . Sandeep and Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta survived . Plus the divine sandbox was still there . The fight was still to continue . Both were thrown into the sandbox , but Poseidon died so they can ’ t have a muddy box . Then Sandeep a former scientist made himself into a super natural being . He can form any liquids including afnoonkoon juice from the extremely rare creature called the moon koon loon toon soon afnoon doon . He then created water to hydrate the divine sandbox . The wtaer was one of the most pure forms of water in the entire universe . When put into the sandbox a water being emerged from the ground was Joshua the Bike Lord . He was riding on a bike that was fully customized with rocket boosters and butt warmers on the seat and in the cup holders there was some afnoonkoon juice . Joshua was appointed to be the referee for the fight . He had no idea what was going on when he was summoned from his 15272836465474848484929282728290948 year slumber . All they told him was that his bike was now on the black market . Including the afnoonkoon juice in the cup holders . Suddenly the great Venkatanarasimharajuvaripeta exploded . So Sandeep was named the universal weight champion of the whole universe . He was congratulated and summoned back at his home town . When he came back it had been a hundred years and his village was annihilated by Joshua The Bike Lord . Then he became a poor person and he couldn ’ t even afford a grain of rice . Then he was picked up off the street by a 5 year old drug lord multi- millionaire named Bob . The End
Do u sometimes feel like ... Just to bleach that shi* ? Just to get rid of all the problems u know ? To f*ck everything up just to see how everyone around would react . To see their fu*ked faces all over the place . Fu*ked up . Just to hit that fu*king wall in a high speed with a fu*king car . I feel immortal that might be the problem . Two faces of fu*kness . Just one I guess . I ca n't do sh*t. Just my fu*ked up mind imaging all the sh*t I would n't do . Why ? The second face that I have . The face that wants to see the pain but I wo n't . I changed . I changed everything about me . But sometimes that fuc*ing devil wants to f*ck everything up . I 'll keep fighting . Never surrender never give up .
Mike was having a hard time keeping his eyes open . It was a lazy Saturday evening and he was watching the NFL playoffs with his wife . The couch was extra comfortable , especially in the reclined position . Mike closed his eyes and began to let his mind rest . Sleep crept closer to him , so much that he could feel a dream coming . `` Honey , '' said his wife , Chelsea . `` Would you like some coffee ? I 'm about to make a pot , decafe of course . '' `` Yeah , sure , '' said Mike . His wife got up and walked into the kitchen . `` You know tomorrow we have to go to church , my parents are expecting us . '' `` Yeah , I know , '' said Mike . He was never really a believer , but Chelsea 's mother was going to be baptised . `` Please try to make it seem like you 're not hating every second of it . We will just be there for the service and she will be baptised afterwards . '' `` I 'll try ... it 's just , you know how I hate sitting there , singing songs , listening to the preacher , '' said Mike . `` I know honey , but I will make it up to you by making you your favorite dinner tomorrow . '' `` Thanks babe , you know that I love you because of the cooking really , '' Mike said jokingly . Chelsea peaked around the doorway that led into the kitchen , '' Well someone is n't getting coffee or burgers tomorrow , '' she said . Mike laughed , he loved their little back and forths . `` I 'm sorry honey , you know I love you , '' said Mike . Chelsea walked out of the kitchen with two cups of coffee and sat down next to Mike . She kissed him on the cheek and handed him his cup . They then talked about the plans again for tomorrow and other ideas like what to do with the gazebo in their backyard . Eventually , night time settled in . Chelsea told Mike she was going to bed . Mike considered it , but told her he would be in a little bit . She left the room to head upstairs and Mike watched the tv , half paying attention and half dozing off . He thought about the football game he was watching. `` Are the Lions going to make it to the super bowl this year ? Hell no , '' Mike thought to himself . Maybe it would be something he would pray about tomorrow , if God did exist . He closed his eyes with a smile at the thought and started to drift asleep . He awoke much later . The cable box said 12:00 . The tv was off for some reason . `` Maybe Chelsea had come down to check on me and turned it off , '' he thought . It would have been very dark , almost pitch black , if not for the moonlight that crept it 's way through his blinds . He slowly dragged himself off the couch and stretched . As he extended his arms , he thought it was weird that his coffee was n't beside his couch on the table anymore . `` Where did it go ? , '' he thought.He decided to investigate the kitchen to get an answer to his curious question . He walked into the kitchen and checked the sink , but nothing was there . The counter was clean too . Mike was trying to decipher the situation when he heard a noise in the living room . `` That 's strange , maybe Chelsea has come back downstairs , '' he thought . He walked into the living room to find someone sitting on the couch . He could n't tell who it was , as the moonlight only made it so bright that he could see a figure in the resounding darkness . He was taken aback at the sight , `` who 's there ? '' asked Mike . He felt like it was n't his wife , no . This figure , this entity , had a dark energy to it . It 's outline looked human , but whatever it was , it was definitely anything but . `` Have a seat , Mike , '' said the being . For some reason , Mike felt compelled to sit , even though his skin was crawling on his back . Mike to a seat on the couch , farthest from the entity . The entity 's head looked staright ahead , it 's face masked from the side Mike was sitting on . `` Maybe a cloak or hood , '' Mike thought . He could n't tell , it was like the being was sucking all of the light that touched it , exuding only darkness . The entity turned it 's head towards Mike , there a smile on it 's face , a sinister smile . Mike examined the face , the only part of the entity 's body that reflected light . It was human esque in shape , but even Mike knew this was no human . `` What the hell are you ? '' asked Mike . The entity let out a chuckle , but there was no joy to be found in it . `` Someone who is interested in you , '' answered the being . `` What do you want from me , '' asked Mike . `` I 've come to tell you that I have a contract on your soul , as well as one on your wife . '' said the being . `` What are you talking about , '' Mike asked , trying to hide the quivering in his voice . `` What does it sound like , '' the entity replied in return . `` I do n't know what you are , but I want you out of here right now , '' demanded Mike . The being flashed it 's lifeless smile , no joy in it 's black eyes , or color in it 's pale white skin . `` How can I leave your house , if I was never here , '' said the being with his revolting smile . All of a sudden , the tv turned on . Mike snapped his head to look at the screen , a reflex since his nerves were screaming at him . He immediately looked back towards the being , but nothing was there . Mike began to hyperventilate . `` What the hell was that , '' he thought . He kept breathing faster and faster . The entity 's smile in his minds eye . He could n't seem to calm down . He tried to move , but felt heavy , like he was being sucked into the couch . He could n't stop breathing so quickly , he started sweating , but felt cold . His eyes started to become heavy , and he fealt lightheaded . He did n't know what was happening . He heard the being 's cold chuckle one last time before he passed out . `` Honey , '' said Chelsea . Mike opened his eyes . He was sitting on the couch , the living room lit by the setting sun . The game was on . `` Would you like some coffee , '' asked Chelsea .
It is an old-fashioned bar - at least , that is how it wishes to present itself . In reality , it is a converted coffee shop , which in turn had been a small office space , housed in a building that could only claim a little more than two decades to its name . The walls are plastered with oddities ; peculiar signs , quaint paintings , and mixed wallpapers attempt , perhaps even successfully , to convey an air of haphazardness . Walking through the door - a large , wooden , construction , painted dark green and with a four-paned window fitted in its upper half , comes a young man - in reality 25 years of age , but looking closer to his early twenties . With a familiar hesitation , and the cursory nod of acknowledgement to the bartender , he seats himself in one of the small booths to the right of the entrance . Wearing a hazel cardigan , with dark brown elbow patches , dark jeans , and sporting a light brown leather satchel to his side , he is clearly distinguished from the normal clientele at this time of day . From the satchel he produces a notebook , followed by a pencil and a phone , and places them on the table in front of him . The first page of the notebook reads : `` What do I want to do ? '' Such a simple question , one would think - being brought up in a safe , supportive , middle-class family , in a modern and developed Western nation , he should have every opportunity to explore his passions and find what he would like to do , right ? What could possibly be holding him back when all the doors are already opened for him ? Well , it 's just that , is n't it ? With only one door open , the path forward is trivial . With a hundred doors , suddenly a choice needs to be made - one needs to choose the *right* door , the one that will lead to the *right* life , the life that is *right* for him . Should one choose the wrong door , and have the wrong life , one will invariably end up with chronic regret . Needless to say , this is an important decision . His parents , and especially his grandparents , love to speak of the freedom he has , and of how great it is . In their day , they had no freedom - they did what they had to , they did what would lead to a good job - not the job that they were passionate about , unless they were very lucky of course , but a job that would allow them to have a family , to have a complete and fulfilling life . With no choice , there could also be no regret , because they could never take a wrong turn . They could never step through the wrong door . For him , this choice was a nightmare that would never end . A fear that he could never outrun , no matter how much he tried , no matter what distractions he flooded his senses with . Even when he tried to wish away the choice by simply picking the first best thing he could think of , it would only be a matter of time until those thoughts found him again . It would only be a matter of time until they drained his happiness , stole his sleep , and left deep clawmarks on the inside of his skull . He tried journalism . He had always enjoyed writing , and had also usually proved himself quite capable during highschool , so it seemed a natural choice , but he never quite felt that he fit in . His classmates were friendly , nothing wrong with them , and the work was interesting , but it just never felt *right* . He quit after a year and went on to the next adventure - a career in mathematics should surely suit him , given his natural affinity for logic and reasoning . Besides , people were constantly telling him how intelligent he was - whether he actually was , well , that was a topic for another time . To make things more interesting , he decided he should study abroad as well - everyone 's always saying how much you learn from that , so it must surely be good . Off he went , and for a time it was good . He got his degree , he built up a facade of interest , a pretend passion , for his subject - he even believed it himself - and returned home to continue with his fantasy . Unsurprisingly , it all came crashing down in a spectacular fashion , eventually bringing him to an uninteresting bar on this most depressing of Sunday afternoons , staring at that unrelenting question . How do other people find their passions ? He had read countless accounts of childhoods spent in pursuit of a singular goal , of minds sporting such capacity for understanding that they could master any task presented to them , and of the great entrepreneurs whose drive was only matched by their ambition , and he could relate to none of it . Was he forever doomed to be passion-less ? Would he go through life a simple worker bee , going through the motions as time ticked slowly by ? Of course , the view is warped - that image he has seen of other people is just that , an image , and not evidence of total happiness and remarkable success . One could even say he should have realised that a long time ago , seeing as he himself had gone through the exact same process , presenting a similarly fantastical illusion of his own life , but unfortunately for the young man , we do not look at others with the same eyes we see ourselves . At twilight the window by his booth was bursting with gold , and he took that as his cue to leave . After all , he had n't gotten much sleep lately and must try to get to bed early tonight , lest he be unable to focus in tomorrow 's lecture . Stepping out into the unforgiving briskness of late autumn , he started on his way home . Perhaps tomorrow would show him better luck . *** This needed to be written more than it needed to be read - it 's the premise of something I 've been thinking of exploring but have n't . English is not my native tongue , so if you see any formulations that strike you as odd or out of place , I would definitely appreciate the feedback .
The half dragon girl ( started , incomplete ) The busy coffee shop was filled with morning commuters needing their caffeine fix . The TV in the corner has local news but nobody is watching . Retired old men who wake before the sun are discussing how bad the president is screwing up foreign relations . The old men sit at the table as they do everyday . The same people come on the same days and everybody is a usual by now . Wendy greets people she knows by first name asking them if they want to have the same thing they usually get . Unknowns are not shunned , but they do n't get the same welcome as the usual crowd . She will coldly say , `` What can I get you '' She might warm up to calling you `` hun '' after a few visits and after a few more , if your a regular , she will learn your name . Bob had a Latte , Ken peppermint green tea and Adam was drinking a plain black coffee . Old school friends who reconnected later in life , they do n't hold their punches . Teasing each other , almost to the point of bulllying . Making fun of each other with the way close male friends do . But they all knew each other well enough not to go too far or say something too hurtful . Bob and Ken were talking about the old girlfriends . Adam was distracted , not really interested . In to the shop walks a preteen girl , green blue jeans , a pink shirt and a black leather backpack thrown over her shoulder . Wendy repeats back to her `` iced tea and a scone , you got it . '' After taking out her yellow Pikachu wallet and paying , she sits at a table for two , by herself . The guys are usually eagle eyed for hot women who come into the shop . Kind of a game who can see the hotties first . But as Bob and Ken were distracted , Adam notices the girl . As he switches from eye spy mode to concerned citizen mode he pan around to spot her mother who must be near by , or in the car parked in the front , or in the bathroom . But she is not there . He spies the girl some more . Thoughts of where her parents are , if she was by herself or what was going on drifted through his mind . Suddently Bob and Ken start talking about going on a road trip and this perks his attention . Adam lets it go and starts talking about the drive through the desert towards Reno , Nevada . She chose this coffee shop as she would not be known here . Nobody would know her here . There were not any eyes on here here though . She could move on . Finishing her cold drink and taking a last bite of her hard bland scone , she threw away her trash and departed . She walked down the street . Adam got in his old pickup truck , his engine hesitating then starting . He turned out onto the street . Looking left . Looking right . He saw the girl . Walking down the street towards a commercial building park . Looking in the rear view , nobody behind him , he looked at the girl again . Was she a run-away , was her mom working in a office building close by , what was going on . He thought about how bad he would feel if tomorrow he heard on the news about some girl who was attacked or worst . He thought about asking is she was ok , but he imagined the awkwardness and decided not to . Turning onto the street , he looked in the rear view mirror to get another look , hoping to see a mother waiting for her or something , but she was gone . He went to work with his lingering concern . Karen walked off the street and into a river overpass . She walked into the round concrete underpass . She looked both ways and then when nobody was looking went in between the rusted chain link fence and the fence pole . Almost not fitting . Down the rocky riverlet shore into the overpass . Maybe she is getting too sensitive , and there were no clear hits today . She can usually sense the dark thoughts pretty well and tie it to a person . With very good accuracy . She has the ability to sense the dark evil thoughts as regular person can smell a skunk from miles away . But pinpointing it in both cased can be tricky . She is half demon , her mother 's mother was a demon who protected people of gentle hearts . Her grandmother protected people from accidents , she was responsible for giving people the sense to become more alert or to see something that would pass them by normally . Her mother took on the same role when she got old enough . She was supposed to marry a demon so that her linage could follow the same task . But the mother instead fell in love with a dragon slayer knight . Their child had half the power of the mother . She inherited some of the mother 's powers and inherited the stubbornness and courage of her father . Once fully in the concrete pipe under the road , without anyones eyes or cameras on her , she thought of home . Her old cozy stone cottage in the middle of a rural green field . Fenced in with twigs and wire the front yard had chickens pecking at the ground . She envisioned it and mentally really focused on what it looked like inside . Closing her eyes she thought of ther fireplace . In the concrete pipe she dissolved into nothingness . As her focus came to a peak she was now in her house . A swirl of particles came together.The warmth of the fireplace hit her and she opened her eyes to the mantle and her mug where she had left it . ...
# # Tyer of Zagachevi Tyer was the little shimrock of Kalmargarden . Day to day he sang his song . Some residents thought it was a cat , some thought it was a bird but nobody had seen him . They have only heard him because shimrocks were naturally invisible to human eye . Tyer sounded like a wounded animal to humans , but its sole purpose was to find human friends . He had heard many grand stories about humans of the earth . Back in Zagachevi travellers told stories of big walking humans everywhere . Mostly at the market though , so Tyer listened to these stories while he tried to steal a gimrick or two , which was an item of food , sort of close in taste to chocolate of earth . If Tyer knew the nature of humans , he would have understood why there was such loud noises and foul smelling drinks many nights in a row at Kalmargarden . But he was superstitious , so he thought this was a way of humans , trying to get rid of Tyer . In the stories he had heard , Tyer knew humans hadn ’ t been very friendly towards any creature from Zagachevi . Humans mostly used these creatures to gain wood material which was pressed into a lightweight paper that had numbers on it . Henchoks especially had suffered from this phenomenon . Henchoks were beautiful creatures with golden skin . Though their beauty brought much anxiety to Henchoks . This anxiety usually caused them to gather their limbs into a cocoon . This cocoon happened to look like a rock . So when humans met Henchoks , with over whelming anxiety henchocks suffered the rock syndrome . Humans seemed very happy to meet Henchocks but never properly greeted them . Proper way to greet a Henchok was to shake its foot with a piece of pine needle . Instead humans put Henchoks into their pockets and traded them for pressed wood paper . Tyer was scared of this faith , for he had heard after Henchoks were traded , they were usually melted into liquid form . One of the great fears of a Zagachevian was to be turned into liquid form . In liquid form , no creature form Zagachevi could implement proper manners when it came to meeting new forms of living things . And if there was one thing a Zagachevian could not tolerate , that was not having proper manners . So Tyer kept on giving out his proper greetings to humans in a form of animal weeping without knowing that in earth , this was absolutely not the proper manner of greeting new forms . He should have instead gotten down from the tree and shook hands with one of the humans while enjoying a foul smelling drink himself . Little did he know this drink would also make him visible to human eye , and henceforth it would be much easier for him to make human friends . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ( Names are made up except for the place Kalmargarden , so I hope others are not real things : D )

Seems like they ’ ll let just about anyone fly these days . It amazes me to think about . These machines pack enough wallop to turn a loony pilot into the bloodiest day in US history , and yet they spent more time checking my eyes than my background . Uncle Sam just tickles me sometimes . “ Three-hundred miles to the target , ” Jimmy says . “ Roger. ” And they ’ re getting more powerful all the time . These new B-2 ’ s , they don ’ t even need two seats anymore—they just kept them in there to disperse the guilt . And for that , I suppose we are grateful . “ What ’ re you planning to do after all this shit , Jimmy ? ” I ask . “ After the war ? ” “ Yeah. ” “ Keep my feet on the ground , that ’ s for damn sure . Spend some time with my boy . Start going to church again. ” I laugh . Jimmy and I are very different . He ’ s from Minnesota . I ’ m from Tennessee ( Chattanooga ) . We ’ re both pretty fresh for bomber pilots but he ’ s already got a wife and eight-month son , where I ’ m a one-man show . “ I didn ’ t know you went to church ? ” “ Well , I—two-hundred and fifty miles—I mean haven ’ t been since I was a kid , but— “ “ See now that ’ s what I thought. ” “ —but I wasn ’ t ever a murderer , either. ” “ ‘ Murderer ’ ? Now , don ’ t you think that ’ s a little strong of a word ? ” Jimmy and mine ’ s differences extend beyond our lives back home . We both struggle with the toll of our work ; daily we wage a war within our minds between justification and self-disgust/fear/what have you . The difference is , I ’ m winning mine just a little bit more . “ Just how does society define a murderer ? ” I say . “ Someone who should be jailed , or killed , by the government for doing something wrong . But us , we were sent out here , with a pat on the back and eight-hundred million dollars worth of ‘ good luck. ’ You call that a murderer ’ s circumstances ? ” “ ..It ’ s not the government ’ s perspective that 's on my mind. ” I don ’ t respond right away . I look at the electronic display ; the desert rolls beneath us . So fast , like a carpet being yanked , pulling something or someone towards its inevitable doom , us . “ Alright , then , ” I say . “ Let ’ s talk about God. ” Will post more if there 's interest !
It was hot . The sun lingered in the sky , shining down without a care for what was beneath it . At this moment the sun was almost directly above the man , it would be several more hours before it would begin its decent behind the hills and grant the cool breath of dusk upon the desert . Until then it would rule the skies . Stopping atop a hill , having hiked through the late morning a man looked up at the sun . Even through his sunglasses the sun punished him for attempting to stare and forced him to squint and look away . He could feel the heat beginning to chip away at him . He was used to this , his exposed skin started to feel the fiery kisses from the sun . He glanced around waiting for his eyes to readjust after looking towards that beast in the sky . A sea of light blue waited for him , soothing sky as far as the eye could see . In the distance a small single cloud floated against the sea of blue . You 're not big enough to matter cloud . Against the sky only a single cloud means nothing , you 're not big enough to provide shade and certainly not big enough to provide rain . Why do you even bother trying ? Why do you exist ? He wondered . Maybe the cloud did n't care about those things . Alone against a backdrop that waited to swallow it up as if it never existed . But the cloud persisted , it was tenacious just as he was . He smirked at the cloud and wondered if it would still be there in a few hours , would the cloud grow ? Or would it disappear ? He glanced around the sky and noticed that there was n't a single bird in the air . This told him there was no life or death in the valley ahead . Hawks circling meant there was life on the ground . Buzzards meant there was death . Over the years he had grown familiar with how to read a landscape based only on the birds above it . The sun boar down as if to remind him who truly ruled the skies . Looking back at the valley he had just climbed out of , he saw nothing . He 'd grown accustomed to always looking back after reaching the first hill , he knew it did n't help him but he still did it . No one was out there , no one followed , it was only him . Forward now to the valley below , again , nothing was there . Only the lifeless desert waited for him , the path he took was well known to him but would be unnoticeable to an untrained eye . He took a step forward down into the next valley , only the sun and the cloud watched on .
Small sample of a novel I 'm currently working on . ****Ace of Spades . **** Austin Texas , 1942 11:30 am A man dressed in a dark trench coat lay on the rickety platform at the top of the church steeple . He had a rifle tucked snugly in his shoulder , and through its scope he scanned the park for his target . Wyatt Jones had spent the better part of two weeks following this man , Steven Williams , gathering Intel on his movements . He had seen him meet with a man his contact in OSS confirmed to be a highly ranked Nazi intelligence officer . He had to hold his fire several times as the monster beat his wife into unconsciousness while their two children watched . He took photographs while Williams cheated on his wife with the blonde in the red dress while on his `` business trip '' in Houston . Wyatt knew everything about his target , from how many sugars he put in his coffee to how many sleeping pills he took at night . All of his efforts came down to this one moment . In just a few minutes , Steven Williams would meet with Colonel Hans Weber , the leader of the local Nazi underground , to hand off the files stolen from Williams ' FBI field office . Wyatt checked his watch . It was 11:58 AM , and the meeting was happening at noon . He checked the window markers he had placed throughout the park , and was happy to see there was no breeze to speak of . At 11:59 AM , Steven Williams walked into the park and sat at a bench facing Wyatt , joined shortly by the Colonel . Wyatt chuckled to himself because the bench the men had picked was in the exact spot Wyatt had zeroed his rifle scope . He took a breath , and took up the slack in his trigger . He released the breath and slowly squeezed the trigger , keeping the cross hairs centered on Williams chest . With a loud BANG the weapon went off , sending a 300 grain , boat tailed .45-70 round straight through the man 's breastbone , killing him instantly . Colonel Weber jumped to his feet , brandishing a Luger semi automatic . Wyatt put him down with the same cold efficiency . He looked at his watch . 12:02 PM . Wyatt stashed his rifle and made his way down to the two prone figures . He picked up the briefcase with the files and left his calling card , an ace of spades with a single hole in the middle , and headed back to his car . He was headed to meet with his OSS contact and receive his paycheck , most of which he was planning to give to the Williams family . With a smile Wyatt started his car and drove off it the city , just as sirens started to sound . He looked at his watch . 12:05pm . Not bad .
I originally submitted this to no sleep , where it was removed for various reasons I still disagree with . Not amazing , but I liked it . `` Podcast not found '' It started innocently enough . I get tired when I drive , but if I use headphones and find a good podcast , I do ok. You find strategies like these when you live in the middle of nowhere and going anywhere is a drive . Fiction Podcasts are my favorite , and the creepy ones keep me especially interested . The Black tapes , Night vale , all good listening when you ’ re bored and trying to stay awake . While downloading some new shows one night , a suggestion caught my interest . “ Podcast not found ” was categorized as fiction/horror , and the description said only “ listen at your own risk. ” I ’ ve always been a sucker for a good sales gimmick , so I downloaded a few episodes and figured I ’ d give it a try . It was a few days before I came around to it , and having a 45 minute drive home , I hit play with a little bit of excitement . The intro was a slow , menacing piano tune that seemed to echo into an empty , hollow space . When the music ended , there was silence , which was soon broken by a soft sob and ragged breathing . Coincidently I cleared my throat at this time , and created the greatest accidental sync up of all time . I cleared my throat just moments before the sobbing abruptly stopped , and the narrator , a young woman , began to talk . “ Hello ? Are you there ? I think I heard you . I can ’ t believe I ’ ve finally made contact…. ” A simple thing , but I was hooked immediately . It quickly became my favorite podcast , and I listened to it every chance I got . The young woman was a character named Lilyana , and she claimed to be lost between the folds of reality . She had become lost in the woods outside her town , and began a series of Alice in wonderland type adventures , each more symbolic and fascinating than the last . The writing of the podcast was amazing , and the actress was particularly impressive . Lilyana soon became like a real person to me , and I reveled in her experiences , each one seemingly written to explain things in my own life ; many of my own flaws and struggles were seemingly transformed into beautiful and articulate metaphors . I could not believe I ’ d never heard of this podcast before . It was revolutionary . There was about 12 hours in all , and I was through it all in 3 days . The last episode was heart wrenching . It ended with a plea from Lilyana , asking the listener to find her , to help her go home . Her final plea sent shivers down my spine : “ to you that are listening , I can feel you . Won ’ t you tell me who you are ? Please ? I ’ m so tired of being alone…. ” I was choked up , tears flowing . I thickly cleared my throat and tried to wipe the tears away , when Lilyana ’ s voice declared “ I can hear you ! Are you there ? ” And the podcast ended , my iPod showing me the next series on my list . With such a strong ending , I needed to know what happened next . Once home , I searched the web for the website , but was unable to find it anywhere . Ironically , every podcast site I searched seemed to mock me , using the phrase “ podcast not found ” to explain that there was no such podcast . I searched and searched , and I could find nothing . Not a website , a production company… . I couldn ’ t even find the iTunes page from which I had originally downloaded it . I went to my iPod to see if the episodes had any sort of info that could help me , and found that the episodes had been erased . This amazing new world I had discovered was suddenly , inexplicably gone . I asked around , and I couldn ’ t find anyone who had ever heard of the podcast . I searched forums , websites , and production studios . It was if it never existed . Having no other option , I let it go . Weeks later , an iTunes email arrived , informing me that one of my podcasts had released a new episode . I clicked , to find myself again looking at the iTunes page for “ podcast not found. ” There was single , 30 second episode on the list . I quickly hit play expecting it to be an ad or update for the next season . I wasn ’ t prepared for what I heard . Lilyana ’ s voice echoed from the speakers , saying the one thing I never expected : My name . “ John , John are you there ? I know you ’ re listening John . Please , come find me John . I need your help . I will send you directions soon. ” I was agape . “ What the fuck ? ! ? ! ” I declared to the screen . This had to be coincidence . Then the voice seemingly replied “ Language , John . I ’ ll explain soon. ” I don ’ t know what to believe . I resumed my search , and I can still find no mention of the podcast anywhere . IS Lilyana real ? Is she lost somewhere , or have I just discovered the most unsettling piece of viral marketing ever ? I can ’ t know for sure . What I do know is this : there ’ s another iTunes email in my inbox , telling me that a new episode is waiting . The link in the email seems to be the only way to listen to it . I tried searching through iTunes directly , and the same words keep appearing , a terrifying message I ’ m unsure of how to interpret : “ Podcast not found. ”
I go to my bedroom , kiss my wife goodnight . I watch my children sleep peacefully in their beds . As I walk down the corridor to the Oval Office I ponder the implications of all that has occurred in the past week , and truly start to think about the existence of God . As I sit once more in the luxurious leather chair that has been my throne for the last 7 years I remember my inauguration , the tears in my parents eyes , it was all so ... perfect . I reach for the picture of my family standing on the front lawn of the house we lived in before I took office . It 's all so distant now . I know they will call my actions selfish . My family will probably suffer much more than they needed too . But I have no more left in me . After being second guessed on every move over 2 terms my hair has gone from a youthful jet black to almost completely white . There are permanent half circles under my eyes . My once defined jaw line has been devoured by years of stress eating and late night drinking . I have not made love to my wife in the better part of a decade and my children simply refuse to call me dad , going with mr president like some sort of press monkey . I am simply a hollow shell of a man . I open the bottom right hand drawer to my desk and pull out the final tool I will ever use . It 's six chrome chambers glint in the moonlight coming through the window . The straight cold barrel rising out like a silver chimney . This exact model was used to assassinate the man in office before myself . Was it ironic ? maybe simply entertaining to a degree that this symbol of Americana , one that helped build the Wild West , would be the end of 2 of its most beloved presidents . I place the barrel to my temple , my hands as still as the night .

I wrote this 2 years ago for NanoWriMo but I never finished it . Loved this first just paragraph so much it 's honestly my favorite work . ( Not trying to boast or anything ) Midnight , perfect time for a perfect place . The freezing winter air blew onto my already frozen cheeks as I walked down the sidewalk . Snow began to fall down from the cloudy sky , just perfect . The light snowfall picked up a little bit , making me cold to the bone . The street lights illuminated the slight snowfall , THe further I walked the darker it got , and then eventually I was just walking on a sidewalk . The rushing sounds of water blinded my ears hearing the soothing sound . It was just so peaceful . Peering off the side of the railing , I moved my hair out of my face when the wind picked up , over the edge of the bridge was a freezing river water rushing around the paralyzing rocks . I slowly crawled over the railing letting my already cold fingers touch the frozen metal railing . I closed my eyes letting serenity take over . The screeching of car tires shook me out of my peaceful moment . A man around the age of 20 was running in my direction yelling words I couldn ’ t hear , The only thing I could hear or pay attention to was the rushing water in my ears . He had glistening red hair speh specks of shows in them , had on a black t-shirt where you see his abs through and some black skinny jeans . He was too late anyway , where he was standing he was too late . I gave the man a small smile as a single tear rolled down my cheeks as I took the plunge.\ My jet black hair whipped around my cheeks , before I hit rock bottom , quite literally . My body was engulfed in freezing cold water so that the only thing I could feel was cold . My body swayed with the water , if anything not going fast enough . My lungs filled with water which caused a burning pain in my chest . I began to panic when I realised I wanted the burn , the pain , and all its glory . My back hit every rock it encountered , making a cracking noise emit from my body . A strong warm hand grabbed onto my leg.When I could no longer hear the rapid beat of my heart I knew the man was too late , I knew what was happening and I welcomed it .
The sun was setting , casting a golden hue over the horizon . Its rays glinted off the lake , creating a shimmering effect . The birds sang their evening song , a chorus of joy and peace . The trees swayed in the gentle breeze , rustling their leaves in harmony . The air was still , a perfect moment of serenity . The sky was a deep blue , fading to a soft pink . A single cloud drifted by , a reminder of the beauty of nature . The world was at peace , a moment of bliss . Suddenly , a loud noise broke the silence , a reminder of the chaos of life . But in that moment , all was forgotten , and the beauty of the world was all that mattered . Peace .
First Paragraph : The sun was setting over the horizon , casting a beautiful orange glow across the sky . The air was still and the birds had stopped singing . It was as if the world was holding its breath , waiting for something to happen . Last Paragraph : Suddenly , a loud crash echoed through the air , followed by a bright flash of light . The birds took flight and the world seemed to come alive again . Whatever had happened , it was clear that things would never be the same again .

I won the championship last year by coming up with a plan that was both creative and difficult . My plan was to travel back in time to the early 1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power . I then infiltrated his inner circle and slowly gained his trust . Once I had gained his trust , I began to subtly influence his decisions , steering him away from the path of war and destruction . I used my knowledge of history to guide him towards more peaceful solutions to the problems he faced . Eventually , I had managed to steer Hitler away from the path of war and destruction , and he was on the brink of becoming a peaceful leader . At this point , I revealed my true identity and purpose to him . I told him that I was a time traveler from the future , and that I had come to prevent the horrors of World War II . Hitler was shocked and confused , but he eventually agreed to my plan . He agreed to step down from power and allow a peaceful transition of power to take place . My plan worked , and I was able to prevent World War II from ever happening . I was declared the champion of the time traveler 's competition , and my name will go down in history as the one who prevented the horrors of World War II .
The sun was setting , casting a golden hue over the horizon . Its rays glinted off the lake , creating a shimmering effect . The sky was a deep blue , dotted with wispy clouds . A gentle breeze blew , rustling the trees and carrying the scent of wildflowers . Birds sang in the distance , their sweet melodies echoing through the air . A family of deer emerged from the woods , their graceful movements captivating . The beauty of the moment was breathtaking . As the sun slowly disappeared , a sense of peace and tranquility filled the air . Silence .

Prologue . The sun was setting over the horizon , casting a brilliant orange glow over the small town of Maplewood . It was a peaceful evening , the kind of evening that made you want to take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment . But for one young woman , this evening was anything but peaceful . Her name was Abigail , and she had been running for what felt like hours . She had no idea where she was going , or why she was running , but she knew she had to keep going . She had to get away from whatever was chasing her . Abigail had no idea what was chasing her , but she could feel its presence . It was like a dark cloud that was always hovering just behind her , ready to pounce at any moment . She had no idea what it was , but she knew it was something bad . Abigail ran faster and faster , her heart pounding in her chest . She had no idea where she was going , but she knew she had to keep going . She had to get away from whatever was chasing her . Finally , after what felt like an eternity , Abigail stumbled into a clearing . She collapsed onto the ground , exhausted and out of breath . She looked around , and realized she was in a small park . Abigail closed her eyes and took a deep breath . She was safe , for now . But she knew that whatever was chasing her was still out there , and she had to find a way to get away from it . She had no idea what the future held , but she knew one thing for sure : she was going to fight .
Last year , I won the time traveler 's competition to kill Hitler by using a unique and creative approach . I traveled back to the early 1930s , when Hitler was still a relatively unknown figure in German politics . I infiltrated a small Nazi rally and , using a combination of my knowledge of the future and my acting skills , I convinced the crowd that I was a powerful figure in the Nazi party . I then proceeded to give a rousing speech , praising Hitler and his ideas . I made sure to emphasize the importance of loyalty to the Nazi cause and the need to follow Hitler 's orders without question . At the end of my speech , I presented Hitler with a gift - a small box containing a vial of poison . I told him that it was a symbol of my loyalty and that he should drink it as a sign of his commitment to the Nazi cause . Hitler , being the trusting soul that he was , drank the poison without hesitation . He died shortly afterwards , and I was declared the winner of the competition .
I won last year 's championship by traveling back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods . First , I used a time machine to travel back to the exact moment Hitler was giving a speech in the Reich Chancellery . I then used a high-powered rifle to shoot him from a distance . This was a difficult shot , but I was able to make it and Hitler was killed instantly . The second part of my plan was to use a time machine to travel back to the moment before Hitler was shot and plant a bomb in the room . This bomb was set to go off at the exact moment Hitler was shot , ensuring that he would be killed no matter what . My plan worked perfectly and I was able to kill Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . This earned me the championship and I was awarded the highest points possible .

The city was bustling with activity as usual . People of all shapes and sizes were walking around , going about their daily lives . But there was something different about this city . Everyone had a special power . Some could move objects with their minds , others could manipulate electricity , and still others had heightened senses . The people of the city were ranked according to their power . I was the highest ranked , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret , not wanting to draw attention to myself . The people of the city were aware of the ranking system , and some had even tried to challenge me for the top spot . But no one had been successful . I had a way of making sure that no one could get close enough to me to find out what my power was . But then one day , a young man appeared in the city . He was powerful , and he was determined to take my spot as the highest ranked . He challenged me to a duel , and I accepted . The duel was intense . He used his powers to try and take me down , but I was able to counter his every move . In the end , I emerged victorious . The young man was impressed by my power , and he asked me to reveal it to him . I refused , not wanting to give away my secret . He then asked me if he could take my place as the highest ranked . I agreed , and he became the new number one . The people of the city were amazed . They had never seen anyone take the top spot from someone else . They began to whisper about my power , but I still kept it a secret . I had learned a valuable lesson that day . No matter how powerful you are , there is always someone out there who is more powerful . And if you want to stay on top , you have to be willing to fight for it .
It 's hard to say goodbye , but it 's time for me to go . I 've been with you through thick and thin , and I 've seen you grow from a child into the amazing person you are today . I 'm so proud of you and all that you 've accomplished . I 'll always be with you in spirit , and I 'll never forget the memories we shared . I 'll always be here to listen when you need someone to talk to , and I 'll always be here to lend a helping hand when you need it . Take care of yourself , and never forget that I 'm always here for you . Goodbye , my friend .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 20th , 1945 , the day of Adolf Hitler 's suicide . I had to be creative and think outside the box to win . My plan was to use a combination of time travel and technology to prevent Hitler from killing himself . First , I used a time machine to travel back to April 20th , 1945 . Then , I used a device to jam all the radio signals in the area , preventing Hitler from hearing the news of the advancing Allied forces . Next , I used a hologram projector to create a realistic image of Hitler in his bunker . I then used a voice modulator to make it sound like Hitler was giving orders to his troops . This caused confusion and chaos in the bunker , making it difficult for Hitler to carry out his suicide plan . Finally , I used a teleportation device to transport myself into the bunker . I then used a stun gun to incapacitate Hitler , preventing him from killing himself . With my combination of time travel and technology , I was able to successfully prevent Hitler from killing himself and win the championship .
The city was bustling with activity , as it always was . People of all shapes and sizes moved through the streets , each with their own unique power . Some could manipulate electricity , others could move objects with their minds , and still others had the ability to sense danger before it happened . But one thing was certain : everyone was ranked according to their power . The higher the rank , the more powerful the individual . I was the highest ranked of all , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a closely guarded secret , never revealing it to anyone . I had heard stories of people killing those of higher rank to obtain their power , and I was determined not to let that happen to me . I kept to myself , never drawing attention to myself or my power . I stayed in the shadows , watching and waiting . I knew that if anyone ever found out what my power was , they would come after me . But I was prepared . I had trained for years , honing my skills and perfecting my craft . I was ready for anything . One day , a group of people came to the city , looking for me . They had heard rumors of my power and wanted to challenge me . I accepted their challenge , and we met in the city square . The fight was fierce , but in the end I emerged victorious . I had used my power to defeat them , and they were in awe . They had never seen anything like it before . The people of the city began to whisper about me , and soon everyone knew who I was and what my power was . I had become a legend , and I was the most powerful person in the city . No one dared to challenge me again , and I was left in peace . I had achieved my goal of protecting my power , and I was content .
I won the championship last year by going back in time to the early 1940s and using a combination of guile and creativity to take out Hitler . I started by infiltrating his inner circle and gaining his trust . I then used my knowledge of the future to subtly influence his decisions , steering him away from his more dangerous plans . Once I had gained his trust , I started to subtly sabotage his plans . I used my knowledge of the future to disrupt his supply lines , sabotage his weapons , and generally make his life more difficult . Finally , I used my knowledge of the future to set up a trap . I arranged for a bomb to be placed in a room where Hitler was known to frequent . When he entered the room , I detonated the bomb , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was able to take out Hitler without anyone suspecting a thing . It was a difficult and dangerous mission , but I was able to pull it off and win the championship .
I won last year 's time travel competition by going back to the year 1945 and killing Hitler in a very creative and difficult way . I had to be very careful not to alter the timeline too much , so I decided to use a method that would be difficult to trace back to me . First , I traveled back to the year 1939 and infiltrated Hitler 's inner circle . I gained his trust and eventually became his personal assistant . I was able to gain access to his private quarters and his office , which gave me the perfect opportunity to plan my attack . I then traveled back to the year 1945 and waited for the perfect moment to strike . I had to be careful not to be seen or heard , so I waited until Hitler was alone in his office . When the time was right , I snuck up behind him and injected him with a deadly poison . The poison was so fast-acting that Hitler died before he could even scream . I then quickly returned to my own time , knowing that I had successfully completed my mission . I had killed Hitler in a creative and difficult way , and I was crowned the champion of the time travel competition .

I won the championship last year by traveling back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I had done my research and knew that Hitler was in his bunker in Berlin , so I decided to use a unique approach . I traveled back to the bunker and found Hitler in his office . I then proceeded to use a combination of smoke bombs and flash bangs to disorient and confuse him . While he was distracted , I quickly snuck up behind him and used a garrote to choke him to death . The judges were impressed by my ingenuity and awarded me the championship . It was a great feeling to know that I had outsmarted all the other time travelers and won the title .
I had been living in this city for as long as I could remember . Everyone here had some kind of power , from telekinesis to electrokinesis to sensors . Everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were , and I was the highest ranked of them all . No one knew what my power was , and I liked it that way . I had seen what happened to those who were too powerful , and I did n't want to be a target . I had seen people of lower rank try to kill those of higher rank in order to obtain their rank , and I wanted to avoid that at all costs . I kept to myself , never revealing my power to anyone . I had seen what happened to those who revealed their power , and I wanted to avoid that as well . I had heard stories of people being hunted down and killed for their power , and I wanted to avoid that fate . I had been living in this city for years , and I had become accustomed to the way things were . I had learned to keep my power hidden , and I had learned to stay out of trouble . I had also learned to be wary of those who were too powerful , as they were often targets for those of lower rank . But one day , everything changed . I was walking down the street when I heard a loud explosion . I looked up to see a group of people with powers attacking a man of higher rank . They were trying to kill him and take his rank . I knew I had to do something . I had to use my power to stop them . I had to reveal my power and show them that I was the highest ranked of them all . So I did . I used my power to stop the attackers and save the man . Everyone was shocked to see what I could do , and I was finally revealed as the highest ranked of them all . From that day forward , I was known as the most powerful person in the city . I was respected and feared , and I was no longer a target . I had finally revealed my power , and I had finally achieved the rank I had always wanted .

I won the championship last year by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler . My plan was to travel back in time to the early 1930s and find a way to manipulate Hitler 's rise to power so that he never became the leader of Germany . I first started by researching the political climate of the time and finding out who were the key players in Hitler 's rise to power . I then used my knowledge to subtly influence their decisions and actions in a way that would prevent Hitler from becoming the leader of Germany . I also used my knowledge of the future to anticipate the moves Hitler would make and counter them . For example , I used my knowledge of the Munich Agreement to make sure that Hitler was not able to gain power through it . Finally , I used my knowledge of the future to make sure that the Nazi party was not able to gain enough support to take control of the government . My plan worked and Hitler was never able to become the leader of Germany . I was awarded the championship for my creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler .

I looked around and noticed that everyone was looking at me with a strange expression on their faces . I had never seen this before , and it made me feel uneasy . I had no idea what was going on , but I knew that I needed to get out of there as soon as possible . I quickly made my way to the nearest alley and hid in the shadows , trying to make myself as small as possible . I stayed there for what felt like hours , until I heard a voice from behind me . `` You must be the one they 're all talking about , '' the voice said . I spun around to see a man standing there , dressed in a long black coat . He had a strange look in his eyes , and I could tell that he was not someone to be messed with . `` Who are you ? '' I asked . `` My name is not important , '' he said . `` What is important is that you know that you are the most powerful person in this city .

You can use it to protect yourself and to help others . But you must be careful . People here are ranked according to their power , and if someone of a higher rank were to find out about your power , they could kill you and take your rank . '' I was horrified .

I won the time travel championship last year by going back to April 30th , 1945 , the day that Adolf Hitler committed suicide . I had to be creative and think outside the box to be successful . First , I created a distraction by setting off a series of explosions in the streets of Berlin . This drew the attention of the Nazi soldiers away from the Fuhrerbunker , giving me the opportunity to sneak in . Once inside , I quickly located Hitler ’ s room and waited until he was alone . When he was , I confronted him with a gun and told him to leave the bunker . He refused , so I shot him in the shoulder and dragged him out . I then took him to a nearby forest and tied him to a tree . I then proceeded to interrogate him , asking him questions about his past and his plans for the future . After a few hours , I had gained enough information to make sure that the Nazi regime would never rise again . Finally , I took out my gun and shot Hitler in the head , killing him instantly . I then quickly left the forest and returned to my own time , victorious .

My strategy for winning last year 's time-traveling competition to kill Hitler was to go back to the very beginning of his political career . I knew that if I could disrupt his rise to power , then I could prevent the atrocities he would later commit . I arrived in Munich in 1919 , just as Hitler was beginning his political career in the German Workers ' Party . I quickly infiltrated the party and began to undermine Hitler 's influence . I spread rumors that he was a fraud and a charlatan , and I worked to discredit his ideas and policies . I also worked to sow discord amongst the party 's members . I encouraged them to rebel against Hitler and to challenge his authority . I even convinced some of them to leave the party and join rival groups . My efforts paid off . Hitler 's influence in the German Workers ' Party dwindled , and he was eventually forced out of the party altogether . Without the support of the German Workers ' Party , Hitler never rose to power , and the atrocities he would have committed were never realized . I won the competition by showing that the best way to kill Hitler was to prevent him from ever coming to power in the first place .

I won the championship last year by taking a unique and creative approach to killing Hitler . Instead of going back in time to directly assassinate him , I decided to use a more indirect method . First , I traveled back to the 1920s and infiltrated the Nazi Party . I slowly worked my way up the ranks , gaining the trust of Hitler and his inner circle . Once I was in a position of power , I began to subtly influence the decisions of the party . I encouraged policies that would lead to Hitler 's eventual downfall . I also worked to sabotage the Nazi war effort by leaking information to the Allies and sabotaging weapons and supplies . This weakened the Nazi war machine and made it easier for the Allies to defeat them . Finally , I planted evidence that Hitler was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the government . This led to his arrest and eventual execution . By taking a more indirect approach to killing Hitler , I was able to achieve my goal without having to directly confront him . This earned me the championship and the admiration of my fellow time travelers .

I won last year 's championship by taking a creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . Instead of simply shooting him , I decided to use my time travel abilities to travel back to the year 1939 and set up a series of events that would lead to Hitler 's death in his own bunker . I began by traveling to Munich and infiltrating the Nazi party . I quickly rose through the ranks and began to gain Hitler 's trust .

He was meant to be here , at this moment , to receive this great knowledge . The creature nodded and flew away . Roger watched it go until it disappeared into the horizon . He was filled with an immense peace and understanding . Awe .

The winds howled through the deserted streets , a chill in the air and a dreary silence . No one dared venture out , fearful of what lurked behind every corner . Nothing stirred , not a single soul , the town had become a ghostly sight . Streets empty , buildings hollow , the town was now forgotten . Stifled by an eerie fog , the air was thick yet still . Suddenly , a distant shout echoed , a faint call of hope . Few followed , their feet leading the way . Clambering up the hill , a faint light shined through . Bursting through the darkness , a bright sun beamed down . Joy met their faces , a distant dream coming true . A new life , a fresh start , in a place of hope . Renewed .

I won last year 's championship by creating a timeline that was incredibly difficult to complete . I had to travel through four different points in time , make sure to avoid any paradoxes , and make sure that my story coincided with the current timeline . The first step was to go back to 1938 and try to convince Hitler of not going to war . I was unsuccessful , as Hitler was too stubborn to listen . The second step was to go back to 1936 and attempt to assassinate Hitler . I was able to sneak into his office and poison his cup of tea , but the bodyguards noticed in time and stopped me . The third step was to go back to 1933 and try to manipulate the political landscape so that Hitler never got elected . This was harder than I thought , as I had to make sure that everything I did still coincided with the current timeline . After a few months of hard work and a lot of luck , I was able to succeed in preventing Hitler from ever coming to power . The fourth step was to go back to 1932 and work with the French to make sure that the German army was too weak to ever expand beyond its current borders . Once again , I had to make sure that everything I did still coincided with the current timeline . This was tricky , as I had to make sure that none of my actions triggered off any major events that could drastically alter the timeline . After months of work , I had successfully defeated Hitler and changed the timeline to the one that we know today . I was awarded the championship for being able to think outside the box and going through such a difficult timeline .
The city was full of people with supernatural powers , every citizen capable of doing things that seemed absolutely impossible . Everyone was ranked based on how powerful they were and I was the strongest of them all , the number one ranked citizen with a power so great that no one , not even I was aware of what it was . Everyone wanted to get their hands on my secrets , and if they wanted the power for themselves , they had to kill me in order to assume my rank . Many tried but none succeeded , thwarted by some unseen force that protected me at all times . This force was so powerful that even I could sense it when I was in danger and it gave me a feeling of invincibility . I was the most powerful citizen in the city , yet I stayed humble , never revealing my powers and never taking advantage of anyone weaker than me . I lived my life in peace , vigilant and aware of any potential threats . Then , one fateful day , I encountered a man of immense power and strength . He was also ranked number 1 and we were evenly matched . I could feel the power radiating off of him and knew that I had to use every ounce of strength I had if I wanted to survive . The fight lasted for hours and I was exhausted , but I eventually emerged victorious . After that , my reputation spread like wildfire and I was known as `` The Invincible '' . People would come up to me and beg me to share my secrets , but I never did . My power was my own and I kept it a secret until the day I died . Even now , no one knows what my power was , but I am still remembered as the strongest citizen in the city .
The sun shone brightly in the sky as I walked through the small town of Winterset . It was a picturesque town , with its quaint cottages , cobblestone streets and low-hanging trees .

I had no idea what drew me here , but something inside me told me that this was the right place . I felt like I belonged here , and I was eager to explore everything this town had to offer . I continued to wander around , taking in the sights and sounds of this delightful town . After a few hours , I ended up at the town square , which was bustling with activity . There were vendors selling all sorts of goods , from handmade jewelry to freshly baked bread . I found myself mesmerized by the colors , smells , and music of this place . Suddenly , a voice called out from the top of a nearby building . “ Let the story begin ! ” A group of adults and children gathered around the speaker , eager to hear what he had to say . “ My name is Jack Moore , ” the speaker said . “ And I ’ m here to tell you a story . It ’ s a story of adventure , of courage , of friendship . It ’ s the story of Winterset. ” Jack began to tell the story of the town ’ s founding , and soon the crowd was captivated by his words .

Last year , I managed to win the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition with a daring and creative plan . A few days before the infamous Fuhrer 's assassination attempt in the bunker , I traveled back in time to intercept and replace his chef , who was responsible for preparing his meals . I had carefully researched the ingredients and meals Hitler favored and created a delicious-looking dish of potatoes and gravy glazed with honey , that was actually laced with a potent poison . On the day of the attempt , Hitler unsuspectingly ate the poisoned meal , within minutes he was dead . I quickly escaped from the bunker , undetected , and made my way back to present day . The judges of the competition were extremely impressed with my plan , praising its ingenuity and execution . I 'm proud to say that I am the current Killing Hitler champion !

Prologue . The sun had only just risen over the horizon , but its rays already spilled into Charlotte 's bedroom . She blinked at the sudden burst of light and , still half-asleep , slid her feet over the edge of her bed and onto the cold hardwood . Her toes curled against the frigid surface , as if to protect themselves from the chill , as she pulled herself upright . Charlotte was n't the type of person who liked to waste time in the mornings . She quickly changed into her favorite pair of jeans and a plaid button-up shirt , tying her unruly hair into a secure bun on the back of her head . She grabbed her backpack and swung it over her shoulder , a habit she had picked up from all the years of school , and made her way to the front door . Yet as she grabbed the doorknob , something strange happened . Charlotte felt an overwhelming pull toward the hallway , toward the back door . It was an odd sensation , one that she had never experienced before , and it left her feeling both confused and intrigued . Curiosity won out in the end . Charlotte quickly changed her direction , following the beckoning call of the unknown . As she opened the door , a rush of cool morning air surrounded her , and before her eyes , the world seemed to become much larger . There , in the middle of her backyard , a lush and vibrant forest stretched out before her . Unable to contain her excitement , Charlotte stepped out into the clearing , feeling the soft dirt beneath her feet . A wave of anticipation swept through her as she realized that this was the beginning of her adventure . There was something special hidden in these woods and she was determined to discover it . Taking a deep breath and a leap of faith , Charlotte set off , venturing deeper and deeper into the dense and mysterious forest .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small town on the edge of a forest . She had an adventurous spirit , and often snuck away from her home to explore the woods . One day , Lily ventured deeper into the forest than usual and stumbled upon a clearing . In the middle of the clearing was a strange and beautiful tree . Around the trunk was a budding garden of vibrant flowers and greenery . Lily felt drawn to the tree , and as she got closer , she heard a voice calling out to her from the branches . `` Come closer , my child , '' said the voice . `` I have something to show you . '' Lily hesitantly approached the tree and she could swear that it had eyes that were twinkling in the sunlight . The voice spoke again , this time instructing Lily to reach out and take a fruit from the branches . She plucked a ripe red apple and examined it in her hands . Suddenly , the tree began to glow and shimmer with an otherworldly light . Lily was mesmerized , and when she looked up , the tree had transformed into a beautiful woman with skin like polished maple wood and hair of leaves and sunlight . The woman smiled kindly at Lily as she spoke . `` You have been chosen , my child . This apple is a gift from me , a sign of your destiny . You are to be a protector of the forest and all who reside within it . '' Lily was overcome with emotion as the woman told her of how she was to use her gifts to help protect and preserve the magical lands and creatures of the forest . Then , in a flurry of leaves and laughter , the woman vanished and all that was left were the echoes of her words lingering in the air . Lily gathered her courage , took a bite of the apple , and vowed to protect her forest no matter what .
Last year 's competition for `` Killing Hitler '' was one of the most challenging and intense yet . I needed to come up with a creative and difficult way of executing the infamous figure without initiating a global war or disrupting the timelines . After some careful planning and consideration , I settled on a plan that , though subtle , had a major impact . My plan was to travel to the year 1944 , when Hitler was living in his Wolf 's Lair headquarters . My first task was to sneak into the compound , which I accomplished using a clever disguise and some old-fashioned infiltration . Once I was inside , I made my way to Hitler 's personal quarters , where I hid myself in a cupboard . From my hiding place , I was able to observe Hitler 's daily routine . After a couple of days , I noticed he had a habit of taking a glass of water before he retired to bed . I quickly devised a plan to take advantage of this routine . On the night of the competition , I waited until Hitler had gone to sleep and then I made my move . I snuck out of the cupboard and replaced his glass of water with a glass of poisoned water . Knowing Hitler 's penchant for a good night 's sleep , I was sure he would drink the water and succumb to the poison before morning . My plan worked flawlessly and the next morning Hitler was dead . I won the competition and was hailed as the champion , having accomplished what nobody else could . With my ingenious and daring plan , I had changed the course of history and won the ultimate prize .

I won the title of last year 's time travel champion by completing the most creative and difficult mission : killing Hitler . I stepped back in time to November 9 , 1938 , the day before Hitler ’ s fateful speech to the Nazi Party in Munich . My plan was to intercept Hitler as he made his way to the event . I identified a weak spot in the security detail and used it to my advantage . I sneaked in a small explosive device that I had crafted and activated it near Hitler 's podium right before the speech . The explosion was loud enough to startle the crowd , and when people looked up , they saw me with my gun pointed at Hitler . I quickly shot him twice in the head , killing him on the spot . He did not have time to react , and his men took off running as soon as they realized what was going on . The deed was done , and I was able to quickly flicker away to my own time . I had won the title of `` Time Travel Champion '' for killing Hitler with style and creativity .
At first , I felt scared and uncertain . Happiness seemed like an unfamiliar feeling , one I had never experienced before . Despite my misgivings , I started to try out the donations that I received . I read books , watched funny movies and got involved in activities that brought me joy . I began to laugh and find pleasure in the little things and , eventually , I started to feel real happiness . At first , the emotion was fleeting and I often worried that it would disappear , but now it 's become a regular part of my life . I feel grateful for the donations which brought this feeling into my life and for the people who chose to share their emotions with me .

Last year , I set out to win the time traveler 's competition to kill Hitler . Everyone said it was an impossible task , but I was determined to prove them wrong . First , I used my time-traveling skills to ensure that Hitler 's rise to power was inhibited . This involved making subtle changes to pivotal moments in history as well as organizing an underground resistance movement to oppose Hitler . My next goal was to create an epic finale that would leave everyone in attendance speechless . For this , I used my knowledge of Hitler 's personal belongings and history to construct a giant booby trap . On the day of the competition , I had the entire room rigged with explosives , traps and gadgets that were set to detonate in the event of any suspicious activity . Finally , I sealed Hitler 's fate by shooting him in the head with a marble forged gun . After the echoes of my triumph had faded away , I emerged the victor of the competition and the undisputed champion of killing Hitler .
The smell of campfires filled the night air as the stars shone brightly . Music drifted from the tent and laughter rang out , muffled by the trees . Despite the joy of the evening , something seemed off , a growing unease that could n't be ignored . Edging closer to the center of the camp , the bustling laughter suddenly halted . All was silent , the only thing that could be heard was a low scrape , echoing through the camp like a summons . Suddenly , with a deafening roar , fire engulfed the tents and the people screamed . Too shocked to move , they stood as the raging inferno swallowed them up and the night sky blazed . Devastation .
Prologue . Josephine ’ s life had been upended as quickly and unexpectedly as a sudden gale , carried away by a powerful wind into an unforseen future . The storm had come in the form of a letter , a single sheet of paper that forever changed her trajectory . It had arrived anonymously one morning , wrapped in heavy black parchment sealed shut with a blob of thick red wax etched with a familiar insignia—the family crest of her estranged father . Josephine had known immediately what was inside , yet had hesitated before breaking it open . Fear stirred inside her like a dark sinister fog , a spectre of what might be within the cryptic words . For her entire life , she had been warned away from her father ’ s legacy and the tragedy it had brought about . Against her better judgement , Josephine had broken the wax seal and opened the paper . It was to her surprise that the words that lay before her offered an invitation , of sorts . There was an offer of employment , one that would bring her back to her ancestral home of Scotland . Josephine read the letter many times , piecing together phrases and fragments of clues . The note was clear : if Josephine wished to learn the answers to the questions she had been seeking all her life , she first had to journey to Scotland and the abandoned family manor of Clan McVey . It was an opportunity that could n't be missed , a chance for Josephine to reclaim her history and make sense of a shadowy past . With a heavy heart and a growing sense of determination , she began to ready her belongings for the journey that lay ahead . Josephine knew better than to ignore such an offer—as much as she was afraid of what she would find , she was excited for the journey and eager to discover the answers that lay in the mysteries of Clan McVey . Little did she know , a thrilling adventure awaited her upon her arrival , an adventure that would challenge her beliefs and take her further than she had ever thought possible . The journey to Scotland would change everything , and it was only the beginning .
My win last year was my greatest effort yet . To achieve maximum points , I decided to go all out and employ a multi-layered approach to the mission . My first move was to travel back a few years prior to Hitler 's reign and befriend a young Austrian artist in a town outside of Munich . This person in particular had a great influence on the future Fuhrer and over the course of several months I was able to subtly influence him to become my ally . The next part of the plan was to travel back to the time before Hitler seized power in Germany . I took on the identity of a high-ranking member of the Nazi party and placed myself directly in the Fuhrer 's inner circle . Once I 'd gained his trust , I seized the opportunity to arrange for an assassination attempt on Hitler 's life . I recruited a small team of skilled assassins , who , posing as trusted Nazi soldiers , infiltrated Hitler 's inner circle . The plan was to pretend to have an audience with the Fuhrer and then launch a daring aerial assault with ballistic weapons . The entire operation was a success and , within minutes , Hitler was dead . My plan was daring , creative and difficult and , as the judges noted , my actions resulted in the end of World War II and the freedom of millions of people around the world . I was named the champion of time travel , and will now go down in the annals of history as the one who killed Hitler .

Once upon a time , there lived a girl named Aria who had a passion unlike any other . She was an avid ocean explorer , and she could often be found scouring the seas in search of sunken treasure or uncovering secrets that the waves kept hidden . One day , while exploring , she came across something truly remarkable : a mysterious box , carved with intricate patterns and inscribed with ancient words . She was determined to bring this box ashore , so she loaded it onto her boat , determined to find its purpose . Back in her home , Aria carefully researched the box , hoping to uncover its origins and purpose . After weeks of study , she finally came to the conclusion that it contained a map of long-lost pirate hideaways . The map was also connected to an ancient pirate legend about a treasure that could be found if one successfully followed the map . Aria was thrilled and set out to sea , embarking on a thrilling journey that would take her to come across dangers and untold wonders . However , what she did n't expect was to find her own inner strength , courage and independence that she would n't have discovered otherwise . After a harrowing voyage , Aria made it to the final destination marked on the map . There she found a secret cove full of pirate ships , crewed by scoundrels who 'd been working together for years . She thought of running away , but instead she stepped forward and used her newfound courage to confront the buccaneers . After a long stand-off , she managed to convince them to give up the fabled treasure . Aria stepped back with her bounty , the sun setting on the horizon and reflecting off the gold she 'd recovered . She gazed upon the treasure , having found not only the riches she 'd been looking for , but also a better understanding of her own strength and determination . She knew that no matter what the future brought , she 'd always have the courage to take on any challenge that came her way .
It felt strange being the most powerful person in the city , yet no one knew what my power was . I had worked hard to get to this position , but I was well aware that any one of the thousands of people living in my city could potentially surpass me . After all , we all had different powers – telekinesis , electrokinesis , and my own personal favorite , sensory power – and any one of us could potentially become the most powerful person in the city . But that did n't worry me too much . I had spent my life cultivating my own powers in a way that none of the others had ever done . I was determined to protect my rank , and I had managed to do so for many years now . However , there was one downside to being the most powerful person in the city : I knew that my rank was vulnerable . Everyone in the city was aware that the only way to surpass me was to kill me and take my place . People had tried to do it before , but no one had ever succeeded . No one knew what my power was , and that was an advantage that they simply did not have . Because of this , I had to be on my toes at all times . I had to constantly be prepared for any hostile encounters , because I knew that the second someone figured out what my power was , they could use it to their advantage in order to take my rank . Fortunately , I had foreseen this possibility and taken steps to protect myself . I had made sure that my power was hidden , so I was confident that no one would be able to figure it out . I also had a trusted circle of friends and family who were dedicated to protecting me , as well as an array of security measures in place around me at all times . It was a lot of work , but it was also necessary to be the most powerful person in the city . And I was determined to keep it that way .
At first , you were n't sure of what it was ; it was strange and unfamiliar . But as the sensation moved through your body , you finally understood what it was - happiness . You let out a joyous laugh , ecstatic that you were now able to feel this amazing emotion . The donation box had been your lifeline and you felt a deep sense of gratitude to the kind soul who donated happiness . After that , you started going through the box more often , experiencing all kinds of emotions , both good and bad . It was an adjustment , for sure , but you were so happy to finally be able to experience the full range of human emotion . You shared your story with the world , showing everyone just how powerful ( and kind ) donations could be . You may have been born without emotions , but that did n't mean that you were unable to feel - all it took was a small act of kindness from a generous soul to open the floodgate of emotion in your life .
It was an unexpected gift , and I was in complete shock . I did n't know what to do with happiness , but I was determined to make the most of it . I decided the best way to start was to use this feeling of joy to help the people around me . I set up a free-will donation box in my local area and posted an advertisement in the paper asking for people to anonymously donate their unwanted feelings . I was overwhelmed with the response and soon , I was receiving donations of happiness , contentment , enjoyment , affection , joy and peace . The people in my community started seeing changes in me . They noticed I was smiling more and my outlook on life had been transformed . The donation box gave me a sense of purpose and helped to instill the feeling of community and connectedness in my town . As time went on , I found that the donation box had empowered not only my life , but others as well . People in my community began becoming more open to discussing their feelings and thanking me for my donation box . The donation box made an impact on my life and has forever changed the way I view emotions . I now know that emotions are neither good nor bad , they simply are . And sharing my emotions with others gives them power to help make the world more joyous .

His power was shrouded in mystery , but everyone respected his place in society and lived in awe of his might . Many had tried to challenge him and steal his title , but all had failed . One day , a young man by the name of Joaquin decided he would be the one to reach the peak of the rankings . He was clever and determined , but soon found out that the Rank One was untouchable . No matter what he did , the man always seemed to be one step ahead of him . It wasn ’ t until one day that Joaquin impulsively broke the unspoken rule of Cloudreach and killed the Rank One in a sudden fit of rage . Miraculously , something strange then happened : Joaquin had somehow acquired the power of the Rank One . The citizens of the city now knew the power he was unknowingly keeping secret : telekinesis . With it , no one could match his strength and he became the new Rank One . For years , Joaquin held his position as the strongest in Cloudreach , reigning with an iron fist whoever would challenge him . But one day , he came to the realization that it was no longer worth it .

Last year I won the annual time-traveling competition to kill Hitler by executing a daring and creative plan . After seeing what the other participants did successfully in the past , I decided to take a different route and travel to the early 1920 's when the Nazi Party was still forming . When arriving in 1920 's Germany , I disguised myself as a wealthy investor and used my resources to join Hitler 's inner circle . I was then invited to a private dinner with Hitler and during the meal , I slipped a slow-acting poison into his drink undetected . After a few days , Hitler died in his bed from the poison . Upon my return , the time-traveling council was amazed at my ingenuity and awarded me the highest score of the competition . The other participants were impressed and I was crowned as the champion of the time-traveling Hitler assassination competition .
I won the championship last year by coming up with a plan that no one else had ever thought of- and more importantly , a plan that no one else would be able to do . I knew that I had to come up with a truly original and effective way of killing Hitler that did n't rely on brute force . I did a lot of research and eventually came up with an idea . I traveled back to 1939- just before Hitler was about to order the invasion of Poland . I had already learned that German plans were severely under-prepared in case of any resistance , and I knew I had to be careful . I did n't do anything overt- Hitler continued with his plans , unchanged . But what I did do was subtly shift the course of things enough that morale dropped drastically and a sense of urgency was never developed . Germany did n't lose a lot of men in the war , but it was enough to completely undermine their entire effort . After a few months had passed , Hitler had no choice but to retreat and sue for peace . In the aftermath of the war , Hitler was left a broken mess , and the allies stripped him of all his power and authority . His life , as he knew it , was completely over . And that was that . I won the championship by killing Hitler without firing a single shot !

He followed its trail until it led him to a mysterious door in the woods . Sir Gawain was about to enter the door and embark upon a great and unknown adventure . He had no idea what awaited him , but he was determined to face any challenge head on . It was time for Sir Gawain to answer the call of fate .
You look at the person and are slightly taken aback as they look exactly like you . The person steps forward , and you feel a wave of shame and guilt wash over you . You recognize that this is the part of you that you have been avoiding out of fear and shame . The person looks you in the eyes and speaks softly , `` You do n't have to feel so ashamed . You have done wrong and wronged people . But , it is not too late to forgive yourself . You are worthy of forgiveness and a second chance . You can begin to repair your relationships with those you hurt and start fresh , with understanding and compassion . '' The person smiles and hands you a silver thread with a small charm attached . `` Take this , '' they say , `` It represents new beginnings . '' You take the thread with trembling hands , and the person steps back and out of the light . You realize that this person was once an embodiment of yourself , and the fact that you had the strength to confront them has now unlocked a path to healing from the pain and sorrow that you have been carrying . You thank the person for their kindness and look inwards to see what needs to be said and done in order to begin to heal your heart and soul .
My winning plan for last year 's time travel killing Hitler competition was bold and creative : Rather than simply traveling back in time to kill Hitler , I decided to prevent him from being born in the first place . To do this , I set up a daring rescue mission in Nazi-controlled Austria , in the early 1930 's . The first step was to find the center of Nazi propaganda and activity , which I discovered was a propaganda rally taking place in Braunau , Austria , in 1934 . I then traveled back in time to that rally and posed as a Nazi sergeant in disguise . My mission was to rescue Klara and Aloysius Hitler , Hitler 's parents , from the rally . I had created a distraction with my fake identity that allowed me to easily free the couple and swiftly transport them away to safety . After doing so , I sent them to Switzerland where they could start a new life , far from Nazi reach . In this new life , they would never meet each other and therefore never produce the dictator ; proving myself victorious in the time aberrant-hunting contest .
Rachelle stepped out of the dingy alleyway , the sun casting an unfamiliar warmth upon her skin . She smiled to herself , her days of living on the streets—dodging police and passing days in a drug-fueled haze—were over . She owed it all to the old man she 'd met a few weeks ago . He 'd handed her a business card and said , `` No need to keep struggling . Come see me . I 'll take care of you . '' And he had . Now she sat in his massive office , signing the contract that would change her life . After years of being discarded , she had finally found a place to call home . But nothing good comes without a price ; the old man had some rather peculiar requests , the most pressing of which was this task he had set for her . `` Travel away , '' he said , gesturing towards the wood-cased globe in the corner of the room . `` You must find something , something that will bring your life the joy you seek . Your journey will be long , but I believe you can do this . Find your joy , Rachelle . '' She 'd never been good at following instructions , but something inside her told her to accept this challenge . So today , she 'd embarked on her journey—one that she hoped would lead her away from being the victim she 'd once been . The day had been long , but finally , as she watched the sun paint the evening sky with vibrant oranges and yellows , she knew she 'd made it . Tucked away in a small shop , between rows of eclectic trinkets , was the one thing that could give her the joy she so desperately sought . Hope .

The sun was already setting when George got to the beach , but he decided to stay and soak in the beauty one last time before going home .

The city full of people with powers was bustling and alive with activity . Everyone was trying to outdo each other in terms of their power demonstration and rank—everyone wanted to be the best , the strongest , and the most powerful . I was a mysterious figure ; no one knew what my power was , yet I was the highest-ranked in this city of gifted individuals . This was n't an easy title to obtain—many people are always vying for it , and those with lower ranks sometimes resort to drastic and illegal measures to increase their ranking . Sometimes , they even resorted to the ultimate means of gaining rank and power : killing someone of higher rank and absorbing their power for themselves . The tension and paranoia in the city were slowly building . Everyone was suspicious of me—what was my power ? How did I get to be number one ? What was stopping me from killing someone else and stealing their power ? I could n't risk it . One wrong move could end in disaster not only for myself , but for the city that I had kept safe for so long . I had to stay vigilant and prove my worth as the most powerful and even-headed in the city . My own people secretly plotted against me , but I had to stay strong—I was their protector . The truth was , my secret ability was the power of persuasion . I had an uncanny ability to convince people to see things my way—whether it was to lay down their weapons and stop fighting or to agree to a peace treaty . Even more importantly , I knew how to use my power to keep the peace and protect my city from all external threats . No one could take away my place as the most powerful inhabitant of this city . I had earned it , and I was going to fight to keep it . With each passing day , I grew in strength and ability—not only physically , but also in my powers of persuasion . As I look out into the city I call home , I see a place that is slowly becoming more ordered and tolerant . People are no longer using their powers to harm each other—they 're coming together and learning to use their powers to benefit themselves and the city . That is the greatest reward I could ever receive for being the highest ranked in this city of gifted individuals .

Once upon a time , there was a small village in the countryside with an odd little secret . While most people assumed the villagers were just regular folks who farmed and went about their everyday lives , the truth was far more fascinating . Every night , when the sun went down and most of the village was asleep , a group of mischievous sprites emerged from hiding and roamed around the village , searching for mischief . The sprites were small and brightly colored with an appetite for any kind of adventure . They pulled pranks , stole trinkets , and caused all kinds of trouble . But they also had a softer side ; they were kind and loyal to their friends in the village , and they watched over them from the shadows during the day . One day , the sprites stumbled across a hidden entrance to an underground kingdom full of ancient secrets and powerful magic . Despite their mischievous nature , they felt a sense of awe and respect and decided to stay away from it . Instead , they decided to tell the villagers about it so that they could explore the kingdom and discover its secrets for themselves . The villagers were ecstatic when they heard about the sprites ’ discovery . They spent days preparing for their journey and packed all the supplies they ’ d need for the expedition . Together , the sprites and the villagers ventured down into the underground kingdom and explored its winding tunnels . When they emerged , they were filled with wonderful stories and even more amazing discoveries . From that day forward , the sprites and the villagers formed a special bond that would last until the sprites had to eventually move on to explore other worlds . Every night , as the sun went down and the village grew quiet , they knew that the sprites would always be there to keep them safe and to keep the spirit of adventure alive in the small village .
The sun shone brightly in the clear summer sky , creating a perfect day . The birds sang their merry song , unaware of the troubles around them . Families sat basking in the heat , chatting and laughing . In the city centre , an old man walked alone , deep in thought . He stopped and looked around , memories flooding back to him . On the horizon he could see the abandoned tower which haunted his dreams . He had made the decision long ago , but today would be the day he acted upon it . Gathering his courage , he began walking towards the tower . The further he went , the more he realised he was on the right path . His feet moved faster and faster until he finally stood in front of the dark building . Taking a deep breath , he turned away and began the journey home , his mind relieved and a pleased smile on his lips . Freedom .
Chapter One : Deserted The sun was setting on the desert like a burning golden fire , and the dusky evening sky lent the great expanse of sand a warm , almost inviting atmosphere . Yet , as Selene stood and studied the wide landscape , all she could feel was an ominous , prickling dread . A shiver went down her spine as she took in the sight of the empty sand plains around her . Nothing stirred except for the occasional tumbleweeds that drifted across the ground . No signs of life , animal or human , were visible . Everywhere she looked was nothing but insufferable desert emptiness . Selene hugged her arms to her chest and shuddered , feeling a sensation of isolation for the first time . Despite having grown up in such an isolated place , never before had she felt so utterly alone . Taking in one final glimpse of the desolate scenery , she slowly began to make her way toward her home . The fear in the pit of her stomach seemed to follow her the entire way , and it was n't until she saw the light of her window that she could finally take a deep , relieved breath . She ran faster , soon making it to the front door . Pushing it open , she threw herself inside and immediately found comfort in her mother 's embrace . Yet , the knowledge that something was off tinged Selene 's relief , a disquieting feeling that refused to be ignored . As the sun drifted further below the horizon , her uneasiness only seemed to grow . What had happened in the desert ? Where had everyone gone ?

Billy was a quiet young boy ; full of curiosity but short of courage . He wanted so badly to explore the exciting world outside of his cozy home . Life always seemed so much simpler within its walls . Every day his hopes appeared faded and fleeting ; that is until one fateful morning . The snow was falling heavy and fast , masking the usual bustling town with peaceful silence . Billy quickly tiptoed down the stairs and out the door , not daring to look up at his parents ' disapproving eyes . His heart pulsed with excitement as his imagination came alive with adventure . Snow settled on his lashes , tiny droplets that sparkled like hailstones . Poking gingerly with his stick , Billy probed the drifts for signs of animal homes or strange artifacts . No traditional boundaries could contain him here on this wintry blanketed field nearby his home . Things became a blur as he trudged further and further ; clearing paths that no one else had before .

My victory in the Killing Hitler competition last year was quite a tale . After much research and planning I attempted something deemed impossible , a time-travel attempt with several parts and a timeline that could unravel at any minute . Rather than going straight for the kill , I decided to find their weak points . The first part of my plan involved enemies within Hitler 's regime . I worked with some loyalists to get inside information and use it to discredit and undermine him before his inevitable fall . Little embarrassments here and there but , slowly but surely , started shifting backing away from the Fuhrer and his schemes . Next , I worked on the German people by promoting propaganda that disparaged Hitler and his ideals . By presenting the public with contrasting images and facts of his atrocities , his prospects diminished as everyone realized how dangerous and oppressive his reign was becoming . Finally , I recruited the most unlikely of allies , Hitler 's people themselves ! With carefully crafted documents , intelligently created leaflets , and rigged newspaper headlines I slowly siphoned the passion Hitler held with a basic concept - the idea of a movement sans its real champion . By then , they hardly had a will to speak of and the party was in such disarray it bordered on complete chaos . I saw an opportunity , then carried it to its fruition with a well-timed secret assassination . With all the spread disillusionment , their leader had no will to exist . Now , it seems like the whole affair was relatively simple . That ’ s how I won the Killing Hitler competition last year - sadly .
First paragraph : Today , being my first day in the new town after packing up the house from the city and making the long drive only added to the overwhelming feeling running through me . Not knowing anyone , having to find a new place to work , and not having a clue what changes this new life would bring , I felt like I might be spinning out of control . Last paragraph : But one thing became clear - this unknown path of life was n't a punishment , but an opportunity for self-discovery . I felt the wind of a dark , mysterious road swirling around me , full of anticipation , adventure , and courage . Everything was now within my reach and I had the strength and courage to get out there and see what this new chapter of life had to offer .
The day I found the box filled with emotion was unlike any other . I had just woken up that morning , feeling especially gray in my day . But this morning something was different - someone had made a donation of happiness . I sat down in front of the box , entranced . As if by an invisible force , my hand reached inside and I felt something warm and comforting . As I brushed my fingertips against it , electric currents pulsed through my body unlike anything I had ever experienced before - happiness . The joy that had been lying dormant inside of me suddenly burst free . Instinctively , I laughed - a deep , belly laugh of pure joy . I knew that no matter what happened , I held this one emotion in a protective embrace and I immediately wanted to spread it to the world . I began doing the only thing I knew - I gathered up as many of the donors ' emotions as I could and took it to my hometown on the other side of the city . There , I happily shared my gifts with those who needed it most - the sick , the unfortunate , the lonely , and the listlessly unfortunate . It might seem like a small gesture , but that one donation gift of happiness changed my life , and the lives of those around me . In that small donation I found belonging , and hope . That morning I was born a new person . I was born blessed and forever thankful for the gift of happiness that was bestowed upon me .
The forest shifted ominously on this darkest of nights , the stars vanishing in its murky depth . Not a creature had stirred in hours , a heavy dread permeating the air . Silence , eerie and pervasive , offered no intrigue this night . Witchcraft had never seemed so potent as on this autumnal eve . The wind bitterly eerie , dancing its way through the trees . Blankets of mist , thick and ghastly pale , compounded the dread . Thousands of truths remained inexplicably hidden in heavy shadows , waiting . Seven moons had passed since this peculiar hexed had appeared in the land , no one knew why . Hesitantly , slowly , a figure slunk into the thicket , hidden from sight . Yet his grotesque aura seemed even stronger , the pressure suffocating , terrifying the forest . Fear rang through every nook , anticipation and suspense brewed , until suddenly one word erupted : Go .
As soon as you laid eyes on yourself , you felt a jolt of both surprise and guilt . You had come to a realization that your decisions ultimately hurt yourself - as well as those around you . You felt a wash of remorse that was stronger than anything you had ever experienced before , clouded by regret and shame , in that moment , for all the harmful things you had done to yourself and others . You slowly bowed your head and asked yourself for mercy and understanding . Without speaking , aware that no words could undo or replace what had been done , you acknowledged and accepted what was done without fear or ego . You cried and asked for forgiveness and the relief of knowing that the action done was solely a result of less than perfect actions and not malice . Your heart immediately felt much lighter with a warmth radiating inside you as you heard your own voice whispering `` It 's okay , we are forgiven . It 's time to start living in the present with love and kindness as guidance '' . You 'd been waiting to hear these words all your life . You walked through the doors of heaven , feeling optimism and peace , free of the past and present brokenness that had followed you until now . You experienced a newfound appreciation for being alive and a rebirth of the spirit that so desperately was needed . You owned the person that you had become and appreciated the love and patience from yourself that got you here . You found you Heaven in the present .

Natalie sat atop the lavish rooftop , eyes gazing through the densely populated streets below . Every single person she met had some unique superpower , though , she had the greatest . As the city carried on , the lack of acknowledgement for her contribution remained tauntingly present . It wasn ’ t that the people weren ’ t aware of her status—everybody knew that she was number one on the leader board and had remained present for centuries—it was just that no one could fathom what the power could be . Whispers filled the streets and the backstreet alleys ; some saying that she was the most powerful psychic in centuries while the others questioning if she used phantasm to shift societies present into the future . All she ever heard were whispers before being greeted by kindness . It had been 230 years since the age of the empowered started and she found joy in surviving it and thriving . Despite how thankful she was , there were frustrations lurking in the shadows . Her powers started to be reduced and reduced as if something wasn ’ t realised from others upon her presence . It suddenly struck , her quiet life belonging to a bubbly person ceased to exist . Pressure formed and rising tensions were only felt when no one interjected . To survive and keep her rank , almost taking what she rightfully believed to be hers , she realised she must relentlessly attack those knowledgeable or weaker than her . Yet , however ruthless her methods were , she kept to a code… A code written so nostalgically of days gone by yet more ironic upon her current personality . Even if incapable of finding love before her power hardening eyes , death wasn ’ t something she looked to bring one to solve her solitude . A code within a code began to form . She used tactics of manipulation , cunning and wit instead of raw power . Perhaps , this sacred form of battle was better suited for her as she then knew what she had to do , survive this typical world of oxymorons and had courage stay true to herself . Natalie thought to reflect as the sun set over the night time skyline… If strong warriors had split and wiped out powerful leaders , the world by design would have been set to colossal fears . But , it was through keeping honour , faith and memories of where before , the number one still stood standing after hundreds of years .
My win last year was the result of a lengthy , complicated journey characterized by careful planning , random luck , and a pinch of insanity . On the face of things , I need not get too far out of my way , so I set the time machine to 1938 Breslau , just a few months before Hitler ’ s reign came into power . After arriving I began to familiarize myself with the cityscape ; learning where crucial moral beacons , such as hospitals and religious centers , were throughout the city . To remain undetected , both in my travel and during the mission , I utilized a range of techniques . I purchased multiple flight reservations at once , as to have tickets to going back and forth ( not showing up isn ’ t suspicious when it appears that you purchased multiple tickets out of caution ) . While in the city , my clothing , phraseology , and lifestyle consistently blended in . In the early hours of a quiet December morning , I snuck into Hitler 's bedroom . To eliminate the potential of being followed and detonated , I disguised myself as a cleaner . I quickly realized that any bystanders would find it odd for a cleaner was canvassing to `` gently reminds '' Hitler of something ... Let 's just say he was n't happy to remain asleep . In order to avoid prolonging an already perilous task , I had knocked him unconscious beforehand . When Hitler eventually did wake , his best friends—his mouth and mind—contained no real evidence that someone had interferred . Afterward , I hurriedly vaulted out of the window and sprinted off to a clock tower that displayed that new time . This ensured that I didn ’ t waste any crucial moments inside in case someone had seemed suspicious of me . As I stepped back into the time machine spent , I realized that the plan had succeeded . The time stops and I am victorious . Engraved from myself and for generations that followed to look back upon , was the new time showcased on of the clock tower , reminding of this crucial historical moment where heroes—both present and past—ride onto the future .
I know it sounds impossible that I actually went back in time and killed Hitler , but as last year ’ s champion in “ Killing Hitler ” , I think I must be somewhat of an expert . You see , the trick is to be both creative and difficult when assassination is your aim . For anyone else of course , caution is key , but as the reigning champion any of the average methods that have be tried in the past weren ’ t going to be enough to get me the grand prize this year . After all , no one can make a career of killing Hitler again and again ! I needed to be clever , so I took a different path . I bided my time and managed to position myself as one of Nazi Germany ’ s top generals . Eventually second in command to only Hitler himself . This left me in position for a takedown . I carefully planned a staged convention , picking the most rousing moment of a speech to send in a small pack of grenades , and bring Hitler ’ s reign to an end . It was creative , it was difficult and it was my victory to relish in , my championship , proudly displayed .
Alexander glanced out across the rolling hills of the western horizon as the sun sunk below the horizon . It was the same site he had grown accustomed to every sunset since he 'd been in Ohio a week before . The surrounding farmlands swayed in the breeze like reflections on the glassy lake nearby , awaiting the night ’ s transformation into something magical . He could n't help but feel a small sense of joy that soon the weekend would be here and he would be able to drive thirty miles east and visit the rusticly ornate town of Queensborough . It was a far cry from the big city life he had grown used to , yet he entranced himself in his small town environment somehow . Alexander turned away from the nightfall , making his way back towards the little inn where he was staying for the week . Inside , the seemingly endless library of classic literature covered most of the available wall area , with the remainder populated by the rugged and elegant antiques that adorned each corner of the room . Taking a seat near the hearth of wood burning hearth on the east corner of the room , Alexander leaned momentarily against the wall and pondered the upcoming weekend and the pleasant ideas he had to keep himself occupied . How nice it was , granting credibility and actuality to a single book seemed worth it , a worth that promised what Alexander had dreamt of , but seemed unable to ever have achieved . That was when a voice inside his head emanated towards him ; it was a voice he had nearly competed suppressed throughout the day , but knew within his heart that it refused to be silenced . Could he make their acquaintance worth the tale of daring ? If he was to fail , sure would a known failure have caused him less hardship than success-in-the-future success ? Again , the voice underneath Alexander ’ s own provided an answer it seemed had no other opinion that could counter it : taking action will only bring forth a new beginning . This idea struck Alexander , igniting within him an indecisive fire , but driven him to stand and march into the night in order to make his future identity as a fiction writer . All he needed to do was prepare somehow and profess the power of remebrance for all that appeared to have been forgotten before .. What was to become of him never became clear on that night , only hope fulfilled itself in the horizon of what the rising sun could bring towards him . He made his out towards the first tavern of the

In only four days , Jacob could sense that something special had been ignited between them . So when his flight home came around , he knew he had to stay if there was a chance of preserving that fire in her eyes . Hearing her say she only loved him filled Jacob with a sense of wonderment and appreciation—he had never met anyone who felt the same way . As more of their story unfolded , friends and family would come to understand the inexplicable magic that brought them together .
I was n't sure at first what to do . All the pain and guilt I had internalized was written on my face . I took a few moments to speak with myself and ask for forgiveness so I could move closer to Heaven . The impact of saying sorry was n't immediate , but it brought me one step closer to Heaven .

Once upon a time in a village far away , lived a boy named John . He was just an average boy , not really extraordinary in any way . But he held every single one of the villagers in a special place in his heart , no matter what trouble or hardship they faced . One autumn night , John had a strange and magical experience ; he saw a white dove appear out of nowhere and fly down before him . The beautiful bird had a shining , silver ribbon attached to its tail , and the ribbon was tied to a long , slender box made of ebony wood .

` Only she said she loved him ` narrated Mark , the young father of two children , with muted anguish in his voice . His divorce form his wife was still raw .

It was a time of unimaginable fear and loss . The nation convulsed , torn between pain and sorrow , the uncertainties of new threats around every corner yet tempered by a familiar sense of hope . Fear had invaded the land at one furious speed , losses piling in its shadow every day . Survival , at such moments , was far from certain , and big decisions were hard-pressed to be made between precious few silvers of hope . David Alan Walker , a 27-year-old man of substantial vision and determination sought meanwhile to build safety within a world in collapse amidst a lingering despair . Some dismissed the son of wealth as a half delusional visionary , pushing further his ambition to restore peace and reunite the co-members of faint ancestry . Others saw him only as some wanton lunatic , willfully striving against wicked demoniac fury from what seemed to be fruitless challenge . Yet at the bottom , beneath all this lies unspoken stories which kept muted about the magnificent battle that initially set off David Alan Walker 's improbable endeavors , and a perilous scene at the town 's top church ruins — the very spot where the world 's fragile fate unanimously unfolded . Widar County , a hitherto obscure business hub , today swelled suddenly in all the buzz and glory with rumors pertaining barely originated within but indeed split all corners of the faint yet gradually intensifying faith- like his pursuit of the evening 's short and dimly tomorrow in harmony with dread since there seemed to unlikely any good escape . As he crossed the bridge and eased his walk in what could become a fight for he very future — the bridge -- David felt an undeniable , soothing calm . People standing from a surging mass formed large pleasant arches symbolizing resonance of clouds in puffy shapes throughout himly- seen gleams of courgeous stamina stirring and tempting his pulses beyond supreme gauvin gazing temmes . Heavilly restless rain still hooved above , suddenly sinking beneath in an flusey barry mantle . But soon , omry soon ! optimism would return !

The city seemed chaotic . It was full of superheroes and villains , each with their different special abilities .

Prologue She pressed the worn spine of the leather bound book and ran her fingertips along its cracked outer edge . It had been handed down through generations of her family , and although the traditional stories it held were easy enough to commit to memory , nothing could compare to its weighty , aging presence in her hands . Reluctantly setting it aside , she picked up the brown bag and fished out a square object within . It had been wrapped in multiple layers of parchment , which she neatly tucked back in with great care . Resting in the hol in her palm was a necklace . Its red glint sparkled while catching a ray of streaming afternoon sunlight before fading once again silver . She wiped aside a grime of dust and furrowed her eyebrows , awestruck by its level of intricacy . An inventive glance of proportions and geometric figures that captivated the soul and lulled all sound into quiet night . Rebeh explored its circular surface and wonder coated its majestic splendor until — Though out of nowhere a strong virtual chill wriggled down her back . Skin tightening with unrest numb . Her fists closed in with a jerk as powerful urges commanded orders to swallow the necklace , bury and spare the infinite brightness so be capable not of knowledge , yet obstruction . Plagued with forces beyond human invention , influenced one . “ Dewafery ” , the precise pair . This rules reversed what tragedy belies and blessings come proud . Steadied the same time the view quite breathe still peace speaks in a defiling payback of sens eons for ultimate reshape in entire reminand . One judgment broke won ’ t last…but lo ! power revealed truth starts … With a heavy breath , Rebeh resigned herself to the miserable reality and walked away - not towards the haggling customers , but towards the worn leaflets pinned to a nearby wall . Everything on the yellow paper seemed indistinct . Names began to blur altogether , the massive gibberish nothing but indiscernible characters of self destruction and blinding suffering . Drawing closer , different pieces became bits and pieces , a microscopic look stretching to grasp the utter feelings only a misty countenance on her beauty face missing can portray .... Milton Vaughan had stated his beliefs loud and clear . Refinements were his only reliance and this piece - a glass glow of fateful embroidery - a gold flame guiding all those ill-fated voyagers seeking
It can be a bit sad saying goodbye to a child that you have been an imaginary friend true . However , it is a natural and inevitable part of growing up . Having imaginary friends can help children imagine , explore , and venture into their own independent world away from any rules and restrictions . As an imaginary friend , you can remain certain that your companion was incredibly fortunate to have met you on their journey . Embrace these good memories and remind them that you will always be with them , even when times become uncertain . The strength they may have gained by feeling safe when in your company during their growing stage is a gift that will last a lifetime .
When you saw your reflection you were stunned ; how could you have caused so much pain and grief despite your good intentions ? Memories of your wrongdoings , your greatness , and your shortcomings rushed through you with newfound clarity and you realized the person you needed to forgive the most was yourself . In that moment , your heart was filled with compassion and understanding and you accepted your imperfect human nature , offering yourself forgiveness . The universe rewarded you with the entrance into Heaven .
Ah , its sad to think of saying goodbye . You 've been there for your pal through it all from jump ropers to studying for tests . All the high times playing pretend , making up worlds and games they never had end . But its time now that your special bond begins to wane . Just know that the time you spent together wo n't ever be a in vain . Understand that what you gave your kid will remain with them always , and that the hole you leave now will lend a to a wiser , brave embracing of future days . But there is no denying that it hurts to realize you will part . Growing older should n't just mean growing farther away from your friend 's heart . So try now to embrace the silence soundless goodbye , knowing it 's the loving gesture here on which you decide to rely .
It had been six years since they we had arrived in this city , adopted into a new home and a new lifestyle , a lifestyle full of people with powers , powers unseen to the normal people of the outside world . Everyone here was at a different realm of power ; from minor abilities able to move tiny mobile objects , to manipulating larger objects with pure thought , and sensitivity and skill beyond our wildest imaginations . All these different levels of power converged in the air here – it was an impressive sight to take in at first – and then someone decided to do something about these convergences the smart and rational solution , rank . Ever since I can remember eveyone has been weighted on the scale according to the power they possess ; a higher level of power landed you a higher force in the system and granted various titles of Ascendant and Ruler class of security force . Of course the hieirray was rarely without error and tantrums – anger and tempers flaring whenever it seemed something was askew especially since everybody wants to elevate themselves up but not anyone else up . It was quick reality every new day after my family had arrived heard when one heard cries of protests as a new head was strangers walked into my neighborhood and put into play replacing old familar faces ones from the exisitingsame cohort who still reflected memories fond ones older crowds gathering every night . When asked I kept somewhat of an unassuming nuance , maintaining an acoustic sound and featureless guise as nothing extraordinary I let them matter explained me off fading off with the same unknown .

Jimmy had only ever known sadness and despair until he met her . He was an 18-year-old teenager living in poverty and questioning the purpose of his ultimately unprotected life . She was a mysterious figure , a benevolent faerie who had suddenly appeared at doorstep of his run-down shack one morning . Little did he know that she 'd been freshly banished from the kingdom Alloydre , punishingly cast out by the angry and spiteful Queen Lune , who wielded unusual and powerful magic . For many months he and the faerie kept secret , maddeningly deep the hidden courtyard of his small dwelling , the sheltered quarters trembling unlike anything ever seen by the beasts lurking ferocious in the nearest forest . Under stillness of the of night its ardor delicately swept away the thorny relinquishment she now endured coursing beside her laughter 's alluring tart . But sometimes pause would chip away at miracles in halting despair acutely touched by sorrow sundered among fine loves brushed lavender from her hair . During one enchanted evening the seductive force griped at their paralisable summons with sympathetic winds of uproarious amusement whispering deliriously that instantly spun an invincible tomahawk tightly twirling up their silhouettes , highlighting lies they had shared and pointedly daring these guarded hinges against the queen . Staring unflinchingly into one another 's eyes they discovered they must part ways bleak , glint tearfully remembered – she beseeched his inner sailor come hug ocean sunwash to satisfy soul stings in remission . Seeking compromise , liberated sprawls spilled onto an artic closeness ; unexpectedly he hissed passionate emotions ... `` Please then , take with thee , thine elfish mazosa dance blessing , '' her weedy walls sheltering fear equally crescendoed lone fears with his surreal ability to prove chance cindronical errands cast by wish 's chance appeal . She whispered in humble awe , `` Ah fear not , for I love you , good sir '' - but forlorn melancholy curled her moral imprint suddenly and without directive spoke through patinal incamence ― '' Yes , I love you , only Jimmy '' . Though her declaration had tugged firmly seemed she 'd done him what surely injustice - for in truth Jimmy yearned desperately to be stated she had love him , too . Thus he finally realised his tentative auctoritas as reality impossibly laid bountifully as burning mortar amongst chinese cracked confetti midst fractured grounds of d
At first , I was unsure how to process this new emotion . I had never felt it before . I started to let myself be filled with lightness , smiles , a feeling of contentment that I had never before experienced . As the days went on , the feeling of happiness stayed hanging around . Instead of feeling punctured with pangs of sadness like before , I was able to feel joy when I awoke in the morning . I even shared what I was feeling with those around me , and I grew a rumour fame ! People flocked to the donation box to try to find feelings of similar intensity , now flush with kindness , enthusiasm , confidence and elation . I realised that feeling happiness consolidated the emotions that the people around me shared too ; it was a healthy cycle breaking the negativity of our communities . I learnt to embody the essence that positive contribution brings , how being the smile in the lives of others brings affirmation of one 's own soothing energy . Suddenly happiness became a second skin to me - no longer outside and circumscribed from self , but assimilated firmly into my day to day outlook . From actively participating in my own emotion fostered enabled living I began to thread stories sewed over this backdrop , breathing life to whatever it met so colourfully and vitally . Life whilst delicate glistering with enthusiasm regularly shifted me , beating intermittently but reminding constantly to relish whatever it brought forth was of grand thingness ; substance challenged but enrichment forever illuminated . Sometimes I still caught my sadness ' gaze in hushed quiet , the nostalgia unfolding in soft tempo yet unfailed fortitude until strength blinded the insight growted before ; awakening it did more wonders and illuminating portals to riches never believed attainable slowly seeded more colours beyond when hope to underlined quenching nostalgia before imagined numbing mirages kindly caring yet grievally resurfacing poises deserved tapping at the gates of grey trying as reward poured beyond recognisable sizes . And because of the others ’ happiness I was gifted , whatever sadness , fear or regret I possess is overpowered , banished by the enlightening reprieve found when all the unsolicited biases leaking from parallel faceless thoughts pause in unframed yet animated glory undiscovered ; strum creating voices and self created emotions growing bountifully : Lightening sensations sparking essential resolve , sealing space orchestrated by the infusion and infusions dreamt glorious harmony . Happiness cascading into insurmountable offerings the donated gift lasting
It 's difficult to see them outgrowing your beloved friendship , and needless to say , this goodbye can be bittersweet . For staying too long can take away the excitement of a new season of growth -- just as it is necessary to move on from things that we once enjoyed -- like summer to autumn . Still , there is some comfort in knowing that you will remain forever in your little friend 's heart , long after you here in this life . It helps to let go gradually over time , wishing your little one luck and seeing their eyes brighten with the promise to embrace the thrill of new teenage adventures ( with or without you ) . Allow them to explore and friendship themselves with confidence and curiosity . You will forevermore be adrift on the affectionate memories in your fostering spirit .
Winning the title of Time Travel Champion last year was no small feat . The stakes were high with the ultimate challenge being the assassination of Adolf Hitler . Making it even more difficult , no previous kills by other online competitors could be used - I would have to figure out something on my own . My time travel quest started with careful factual research about Hitler ’ s known movements in 1919 . Finding the right place and the right girl proved central to the scenario I engineered . I focused my cross-time hopping mainly around Winnie and Herman the Military Boot dealer near Hahnke ’ s Hallmark Shop . Teenaged Romeo had called upon fiery Juliet numerous times holding cherished messages stoked with prayer cards and money gifts afoot nearby upon the western bars shield of Rosesheim . The youthful Adolf unscathed reveals jubilant promise of Haus of Guns , wherein valor and prizes of loving memory worthed a ballyhoo victory indeed . Arriving one week before Rudolf Hess brought home a tin Hitler figurine puzzle , my investment paid forward earnest authority when Monty the Magical Juggler stopped infactum by town with a weather laced dream of hope . Momentary incapacitation transposed inanimate fate towards trajectory synonym of change provided voluntary missing footsteps of agenda nine whence worry wearing Adolf withdrawn unscathed . Share my victory has put me in the running of becoming a two-time champion . I 'm staying on top of the latest potential hit points any would-be challengers this year that may place vying for the ultimate challenge of Killing Hitler .
Danny crammed the last box into the small locker of his train compartment . Canting his head to the side , he tried to assess if there was any more space he could squeeze into .

This family had endured a complex and prolonged phase of internal chaos , unrelenting sadness , and shattered dreams . Their names were Harmas Westford , Lydia Westford , Casey Westford and Thomas Westford . The Westford family were lost travelers traversing a harsh , unfamiliar landscape , headed straight towards monstrosity . The terrifying thing that ruined their lives began only a few months prior . It all began that day when Harmas had brought an artifact of an uncommon nature home - it glowed brighter and brighter when touched wirelessly . And Nothing more was known by anyone except Harmas , or at least not until it arrived at the family ’ s modest but beautiful home . The once perfect and beaming Westford family seemed to spawn unwarranted vivaciousness . Everyone was astounded yet horrified for impossible reasons yet beside from their insightful paintings on the dining room wall ; no one quite knew what to make of the disarray that tomorrow would bring . Little did they now know , the Westford family has ‘ crossed ’ ashore the rivers of doubt and delved a deeper degree into further unforeseen peril . No stranger as peace for Thomas on this unwarranted evening , but stead-fast by the familiar concepts of science and proven methods for his recklessness . Hours seemed to pass by as the child once faint memories resurrect from into the realm of importance blocking stately captos of amity invidia etched within the ensnares Thomas heard a distant creek .

Sonia had been the # 1-ranked power user in the city for nearly a decade , yet nobody could verify the full extent of her powers . That fact alone kept many of Sonia 's potential adversaries from attempting to assassinate or overtake her ranking- aside from her incredible reflexes , she gave off a `` stay back '' vibe that only the odd stray force user dared to try and explore .

There were those who said that second chances snatched Victor from hell and he didn ’ t fail to appreciate the gift . After two wasted years paralyzing what unfastened itself right before the explosion , his reckless dreams got seized through deprivation , and both never ever gained their purpose . He resumed his anguished tears of redemption morning after morning , emptying himself through the foggy residue left after sunset . Victor ’ s paths lay trapped under asphalt highways , conscious of his upcoming jump , until he forcibly lunged towards foreign walls dappling the dancing rainbows on luxurious coils and superb depths stacked in floating celebration consuming constantly those immutable looks able to impel thoughts and views deeper into themselves , a wide-raging dungeon luring himself at interesting , strange cadence that could n't find any echo or remainder anywhere else , coaxing inspired libretti intense as native precipitating dives fulfilling themselves for the first time Victor felt each breath to be part of an unfinished dialogue turned tangible to hide infinite tender journeys laden solemn fragility and vigor stemming from never meant hollow expectations praised by oaks tapping darker precipices bartering avowed disesta bly timeless confessions struggling out profound negligence uttering incredibly misunderstood quests turning heads and stealing modest sparks coll ...
I 've lived in this city my entire life , and sitting on top it seemed I achieved the ultimate status…everyone knew of my accomplishments and I was constantly praised as the stronghold protector of our city . But there was always a lingering curiosity - what was my purpose ? Were there any other citizens who provided the same amount of purpose and duty in the town that I did each and every day ? No one seemed to know the extent of my rank until now .

Last year 's victory took a bit of ingenuity . Tom used his time machine to travel all the way back to 1936 and devised a plan . First he traveled throughout Hitler 's Germany and sabotaged several military events and experiments . Because he could move quickly through time , none of the events fully happened and no lives—other than Hitler—were harmed in the process . He was setting up a series of coincidences that would eventually play out in 1945 . Using some forged photographs which Tom set up months earlier 9in early 1946 ) to convince German soldiers in 1945 total fake informtahiom , Tom lured Hitler far away from his offensive line .

It was something that Sarah was feeling all week . A certain nag of worry about what was to come . She left home early that Sunday and had no idea that her world would be flipped upside-down by the day 's end . Frantic waves of fear rolled through her body until she could n't tell up from down , wrong from right or comfort from chaos . The rush of every single moment eventually hugged her , like a full-length succulent novel finally fading into its satisfying and hard-anticipated conclusion . A spark of understanding hummed through her core and she knew then , that things would never be the same .
The road to Moonyville was never a straight line . The meandering street thanked all the visitor pilgrims for later discovering particular attributes amongst slow moments of moving and traffic .

I was astounded and bewildered when the first time someone donated happiness to my donation box . I 'd been receiving unfavourable emotions all throughout my life—negative ones , such as sadness , fear , and regret—which seemed overwhelming and insurmountable . Yet tangible hope was cascadingly now locked out to me with the mere presence of a sense of happiness . At first , I hesitated to accept the unfamiliar sentiment ; in seriousness , it perplexed me greatly—causing provocative reflections of what I was lacking thus far . Despite the inner scorrics , I did run with it acknowledging that conditional or otherwise—my essence was floating into a fresh interpretation of natural positivity .

I blinked , unable to quite believe my eyes . Perched on top of the other items in my donation box was a beautifully colored jar full of an aura that radiated within and surrounding it .

Last year 's championship concluded with an intense and creative victory for the eventual champion of the races . On the night of April 15th , 1945 , something in the air of Europe seemed different . I knew something was n't normal in the timeline , so I dared to turn the gate switch on my chronosphere pod earlier than usual . I appear moments before mid April of 1937 , ready to thrust immediately into action . What I saw wondering the streets was never before seen during these visits in my family 's of time travelers- the existence of an ancient royal castle . Hopping with ease from one mini fortress pool to the other , careful movement would lead to the destination fifty five feet higher situated less if 52 steps , taking me so close it would launch me nearly into the upper rendezvous- level should guide only . Fascinated but knowing I only had five minutes exactly , I propelled jauntily from balcony window to drop beacon for expected visual relief .

Everyone in the city knew you , but no one knew what power you had . Some said you commanded the elements of nature while others were convinced you had secret control of public thinking .

John awoke in the middle of the night , his heart pounded and his sheets felt damp with perspiration as if everything was slowing to creep to an unknown destination . Glancing down at the dark wooden floors of his converted apartment he suddenly felt a draw towards his window , lured like a moth to a flame , compelled to witness something out of his control beyond the glass barriers . A mysterious figure faced back at him and a perverse dread filled his frame , adrenaline rushed his blood through his body like the epicentre of a monstrous sea-way wave crushing all temptations to oppose and easing its darkness round and around like a deadly trail know to be debilitating .... eight hours later he emerged tormented and soul crushed offering no answers as to the events of the past dark hours .
She said she only loved him . They had met when neither had expected it in a bustling cafe on the corner of Main Street . Abigail resided in the neighbouring town over and happened to frequent this particular eatery whenever she visited . Clyde , his weather-worn face brightening at the sight of her , instantly recognised what Abigail didn ’ t know . Upon exchange of small pleasantries , he still hadn ’ t voiced whatever kept him rooted to the spot . Poor Clyde , she thought later . He simply couldn ’ t and probably would never be able to marshal the courage to tell her . Despite their grey hair , dignified air notwithstanding ; it could not deny the budding chemistry between them during that fateful encounter last Monday . Being two unlikely souls in their transcendent 60s to hone romantic feelings was rarely the case anyway , Abigail considered as fate handpicked them both and cautiously beginning to believe – almost too yearning – which made her delicately wince once she exchanged piecemeal goodbyes with them last Wednesday over lunch . Benevolent touch and admirable words kindled something rose-tinted in them , nonetheless meeting was coming to abrupt halt despite all of its potential , intensity yet joy through the week also floated away at that agonising dusk around dusk . Faces accrued on the literal rail-tracks between same time earlier seasons indulgently swam by ; together under same cluttering park – tickey joint – her remembered silhouette tracing gardens full with creepers dwarfing distant screams still have her guarded self shudder until today . Their destiny dreamily tagged along again ending , one rolled upstairs-hard admitting her pangs aren ’ t forbidden allowing invigorated feelings matter ! Abigail winding days dashing feather went masterfully bright next Thursday confessing ‘ she only loves him ! ’ .

First paragraph : The tense silence wrapped Brigit tighter than the protective wool coat she was wearing . The throbbing of her mind echoing the heavy risk surrounding them . She pressed her back tight against the mossy crumbs of curved seams that rung the walls of the train car and searched one by one at each incoming passenger . There was Kevin she had known in high school and Tyler whom she saw near the shops everyday . Neither paid her even an ounce of mind . Last paragraph : Despite apprehension and chaos , a spark leapt in her mind . She rose from the honeycomb pine to comb another row of strange , fleeting but defined faces and recognition bloomed across her now familiar strangers . The mismatched map wove emotions in the once quietly muddled crossroads . Timothy ! ! ! had she found if ? Pulling out some change for the train she soon found herself sprinting the aisles ; already eagerly planning for the things he and her oath to never have paid mind .
I had traveled back a decade when Hitler originally rose to power . I introduced myself as an visiting diplomat , and got himself shockingly close to Hitler . When I got the chance , while standing right in front of the Nazi leader in broad daylight , I dramatically removed a hand mirror about as wide as my chest . Taking advantage of the stunned stillness , I knocked him across the foreheads using the flashlight in one fatal swoop . Inc money this impossible yet ultimate rick grand prize had at awe ; I watched Hitler lay still in his own pool of blood , at the hands of the tried and true courageous royal me .
Being a fading imaginary friend is a bittersweet situation , and my experience as one has been bittersweet too . At first , the kid totally depends on me !

John and Joelle had been together for years and up until that point , they we thought to be made for each other . For both of them , forever standing together was their sole expectation for the future ; little did they realise the growth in love that three birthdays had bought out in each of their souls could quickly descendar and transmit far regardless of danger from common sense and rationality .

Last year 's championship require showing both great creativity and determination when it came taking out Hitler in some unusual way . After exhausting visits to the pages of human history I seem to alight upon the fifteenth century religious war of a remarkably reputable Seals sect of East Alemania ancestors .

Danita had tried so hard to pretend that the feelings she had towards Marco were n't love , but when he suddenly professed his deepest love for her , she could n't help but admit in return , only to herself that she had been foolishly in love with him as well . She did n't display her emotions outwardly , or risk dire humiliation again , opting instead for coolly detached , only revealing the quavers in her voice , when she told him she loved him , only a little , and hated being in the vulnerable place she was in now . Harmless strolls around the islands replaced nervous conversation filled chassies visits . Little meaningful favors at the off hour represented efforts not seen before . Courtship in a world much like cruise instead knowing your roots was excited if lacking human connect at times . Long intense baths in gut shaped gorgeous outdoor pool rocked teenage Paris like sweet ambience filled by white dream birds whenever sun war pose proud coupled leaf for stretching of longings evaporating in seconds .

Jennifer crouched behind the old picket fence , fear paralyzing her with each rushed breath taken ; She had to escape . Nipping through the small pass in between her hands were shook with dread and palms slicked with nervous sweat . Tense stoned silence overwhelmed her short refuge . Scanning all that ’ s around was temporary recreation nonetheless certain intruder 's jangling of tough chains hindered her reassured plan of refuge Coveting escape into a shimmering light glimmered beyond the obscure darkness . Momentum tipped propelling ourselves forced She gulped deep relief but that 's when She noticed dusky shadows move fast trailing malicious capriciousness of fear Fully awakened by hazard She jerked frightening far far too sinister Advancements progressed in perpetual trifling Shadow grasped softly sweet unknown singing mercy Buried in bewilderment considering icy unexpected comfort apparent amongst considerable despair Tears glimpsed fading abruptly Morning eventually hesitated by ... Fate . Untracked . Released .

He slammed the door shut as quickly as it was opened . The image would n't leave his head . In his own room she ... how could she ? He pushed the thought out of his head and rushed away from the room , eyes beginning to fill with tears . This was it . He needed to cut her out of his life like he should have long ago . It was the third time she had cheated on him in the past year . He rushed down the stairs in the apartment building and made his way to the car . He was furious , he was jealous , but above all , he was hurt . How could the woman he would die for betray him like this ? He sat in the front seat with his head on the wheel as his phone began ringing . Her name popped up on the cell phone screen . His rage grew as he answered. '' What ? ! '' He spoke loudly , the anguish audible . There was a few moments of silence as he listened carefully to her words . His eyes grew soft as he quietly hung up the phone . The man slowly got out of the car closed the door and made his way to the stairs once again ... He felt the knot in his stomach tighten . He felt sick with himself , she won him back again . He knew he would regret this . He was so ready , so prepared to leave ! Only , she said she loved him .
*Yeah , so I´ve been playing a lot of Star Wars : The Old Republic lately . * He was doing what he had to do , he kept telling himself as he circled her bed . She was asleep , passed out from the chems he had hidden in their drink . He sat down beside her , softly running his left hand through her face , his right hand holding the hilt of his lightsaber with a tight grip . `` Her death will bring peace to the galaxy '' , the words echoed in his mind , he was told Supreme Chancellor Gawl would surely accept their demands after witnessing the Sith could so easily get to his family . He naively believed it all , he accepted each and every word from Lord Utharr as law , trusting his knowledge of the dark side to guide him to power , power he was led to believe he desired so much that he force bound his life to his duty , yet he never seeked this power , the blind obedience to the Jedi code and the abdication of love required by the council were what drove him away from the order . And just now he realised he had only switched sides of the same coin . A flash of red light , the sizzling sound of his blade moving through the air and the smell of burnt flesh , she woke up in time to see his body hit the floor , a gaping cauterized wound in his chest , a hint of a smile in his face , her death would serve the Empire well , only she said she loved him .
Seconds passed . The crowd gazed on as he stood in the humiliating shambles of a mess he had created . It was a social nuke that destroyed his world , his future . As he left the church for the last time she came up from behind and touched his hand . Only she said she loved him . Minutes passed . He wrung the steering wheel like he could maybe squeeze a drop of old grease from its rubber . He sped out of the city , teeth clenched like the traffic he left behind . Where do you go from this ? All his friends , his whole world lost . But ... not all . She was there , the one light in the darkness . But no , it 's just a fantasy . She only said she loved him . Hours passed . He sat alone with the blank walls of his thoughts and house to entertain him . The shreds of his decorations remained strewn across his floor . Where do you start to rebuild when all that 's left is ash ? The light of his phone caught his eye . She said she had talked to them , but they remained unmoved . She said only she loved him . Days passed . Ignoring all calls , his phone eventually died . He liked the calm , he felt stable in this dull drywall cave . Finally she came knocking to see if he was alright . She knew he was in there , she said . Let her in , she said . It was the least he could do . She said she only *loved* him . Years passed . They were n't surrounded by flowers or friends or festivities , but it was beautiful to them nonetheless . They faced each other , smiling as broadly as could be . She the ring slid onto his finger before saying those closing two words . She said she loved only him . Decades passed . He rushed up the steps , through the blinding halls , and burst through the door . Strained , tired eyes stared back from the pits in her face . She had been sick for a year now , but she said she needed him today . She smiled weakly up at him . She said she loved him , only ... -- -- *The implied last paragraph says : `` She passed . `` *
He ran his fingers past the peeling red paint up the musty stairwell , as he had many times before , letting the dim moonlight guide him to her rose colored room . Her door was open , her leg up against the bed as she rolled her stockings back on , her hair disheveled and her neck wet with sweat . He ran his hand across her shoulder and breast . They were still warm from the last John 's grip . He pulled her into his body , fighting back the bile retching in his stomach . As he entered her , she quietly cried that she only loved him . She only loved him .
She said she loved him , and she did . More than anything . The way her eyes were closed made her seem at peace . He wept silently kneeling on the floor with his face in his palms . His tears fell through his fingers onto the note she had written and made the ink run down the paper . A small ocean breeze blew through the open window and her limp body began to sway from the ceiling in an eerily gentle fashion . She always said she only lived for love , he loved someone else . She said she loved only him . EDIT : dudes and dudettes , thank you so much for the appreciation and for reading ! Seeing all the love and positive feedback I got from this is an amazing compliment . Thanks for reading !
Like two butterflies dancing atop a field , their shy smiles came close together and , upon realizing the pleasure of the other , faded back to a safe distance once again before hesitatingly , almost teasingly , returning for more . Their dance , a bow , a curtsy , demure smiles warring with brash admiration followed them about the elegant floor along with the weighty stares of their families . Lost in a crowd of dancers , their palms tingled upon meeting and the feeling lingered as they parted . Back ... and forth . Parting and embracing as regular as the ocean 's lips caress the shore . Blushing at the thoughts in his eyes , she could not stop herself answering the unspoken question playing about his lips . How could she not ? She felt as if she had always known him , would always know him as she knew herself . Later , when the great story of their romance was retold , they would say of this moment , `` She said only she loved him . ''
The very Earth stood still . George had stopped moving . She Lay broken at his feet , her blood on his hands . The temple ’ s roof had collapsed , stray rays of sunlight illuminating the horrifying scene within . The silence was stifling , punctuated only by the occasional crick in the old stone walls , accentuated further by insects scurrying across the cold grounds . *I could not protect you . * Tears begun to stream across George ’ s craggy face , flowing over the ancient vines that held his monumental concrete body together . She Began to stir , looking at George through blood soaked eyes . “ George ? ” She Called , desperate , crawling towards the giant stone leg that lay next to her . She Touched George ’ s cold stone leg , he did not stir . “ George… Where are you ? ” George heard her weak voice , but still he would not move . *I no longer can be with you . I have failed you . * “ Failed me ? You… ” Blood spilled from her mouth . “ You… protected me. ” *I… I did not . Not enough . * She Cried , unable to hold him any longer as she felt her life slip from her fingers . She Mouthed her final words , then expired . She said she loved him , only…
Sometimes choices , he knew , came down to not what option was best , but what option was not the worst . He 'd come to say goodbye to her . He 'd known her secret for some time . Her eyes were moons , and he was her sun ; they beamed back most brightly when his glow illuminated her . She 'd fallen hard , and he knew his gravity could only drag her around in circles . He 'd chosen to set her free of it . He could not be responsible for lighting her world . When he told her , he saw fire rise to her eyes , and heat come to her cheeks . The tears that came next stifled the glowing embers , but he knew , in time , she would outshine all the stars in the sky . She started to argue , but the tightness in her throat cut it short , `` Only ... '' she said . She loved him .
`` You know , there is this girl in the town who has long blonde hair and walks kind of funny . '' said Paul . `` But I love the way she walks . '' `` But you always get rejected by girls , do n't you ? '' asked John . `` This time , I will succeed . '' -- -- - A few hours later Paul was walking around the college . As soon as he noticed her , he gathered up his courage and went next to her . `` Umm , hello ! I 'm Paul , what 's your name ? '' `` ... '' `` My name is Paul , what 's yours ? '' She was looking as if she wanted to answer but she could n't . She moved her hands quickly waiting for a reaction . `` Oh , she must be deaf and mute . '' Paul mumbled . He tried to remember if any of his friends knew the sign language . He already had fallen for her . Meanwhile , the girl had written `` I 'm Lucy . I ca n't speak but I can hear . '' and her phone number on a paper . -- -- - Later that week , Paul and Lucy were very close friends . Even if Lucy could n't talk , they managed to communicate by text messages . Lucy had lost the ability to speak after being attacked by a dog at the age of 4 . Since that day she had recieved speech therapy but it was no use . `` I want to be able to speak again . Even if it is once , before I die . '' `` I 'm sure you will , just do n't lose your spirit . '' `` As long as you are with me , I will never lose it ! '' -- -- - 3 months later , they already had gotten engaged . `` Paul , I have been diagnosed with breast cancer . It 's not that I will die or something . Wo n't lose my spirit ! '' ... `` Her situation is not getting any better . She must be lying to you to make you feel better but be prepared for the worst . '' It was a nightmare . It had to be a nightmare . He just needed to wake up . -- -- - `` You may talk to your girlfriend , but do n't overdo it . '' He did n't know if it was the drugs or the cancer . She was sometimes staring blankly at the wall as if she literally lost her spirit . `` I know you are suffering a lot , being treated for 5 months ... I wish we had more time together . Now you will leave this world without fulfilling your dream . If only I could hear your voice . Even if it was a sentence . All I want you to know is that I will always love only you ... '' All of a sudden , her heartbeats started to destabilize . Her heart was losing its rhythmic pace . `` Doctor , DOCTOR ! '' Paul rushed towards the door to call the doctor . `` I ... love ... you ... too ... ... '' said a gentle and kind voice seconds before the continous beep of the monitor . It was the voice of an angel . I was the sound of heaven itself ... She only said she loved him . -- - First time , english not main language , zero experience blah blah blah also very bad story but I just wanted to try Just criticize all you like . edit : corrected John to Paul : V edit : angle - > angel lol
They were ... Seventeen when it had happened . They matched over Tinder . He thought she was cute , she thought he was handsome . They got along well enough . He asked for her number . They talked more . He asked her out . She said yes . They met for dinner , and they talked . Talking was an understatement . They connected . They understood each other . They clicked . They told each other stories and watched videos of each other on their phones . He told her jokes and used his cheesy pickup lines . And she laughed . What a wonderful laugh . He looked at her , and she looked at him and they clasped hands together as if they 'd done it a hundred times before . He drove her home . They watched a movie . They kissed . They kissed . She 'd call him for help with her History homework . He 'd text her asking how to be a good Journalist . She 'd ask him how he was holding up . He 'd ask how her day went . She 'd tell him to go outside and look at the stars , he 'd tell her he could see Orion and Sagittarius . She 'd tell him good morning and have a good day , he 'd tell her to have a goodnight and sleep well . They clasped hands , and this time hey had done it a hundred times before . High school ended . College began . They said distance made the heart grow fonder . They lied . They fought . So much love between them , bringing them back together and begging to put their inhibitions aside . But they were prideful ones . Neither willing to admit , or accept fault . And then , there was no more 'and then ' . There was no more they . Just him , and her . But , while their story may be over , they do indulge in re-reading it 's pages now and again . Be it seeing an old picture , or an old friend 's mention . They both smile , because they knew for sure that once , many years ago ... He said he only loved her . She said she only loved him .
He thought about writing a note . It seemed like the done thing . He took put pen to paper but her words echoed through his head . He put the pen down , leaving a solitary dot alone on a vast page . Apt . He thought of his parents , his colleagues , his neighbours . What would they make of this ? Her voice again . His mind was made up now . He opened the window and peered down at the city below . She said only *she* loved him . No one else . He took a step into the blackness of the night , letting the city swallow him . She said only she loved him .
It was the longest day of his life -- potentially his last . A day of never ending darkness and blurs of light as the sounds of mechanical beeps and pumps filled his empty mind . He lay amidst supposed friends and family . No one cried , that he could see . Tubes and ceiling obscured his vision . One by one they left until only one stayed . He could hear her . His daughter . In her early 20 's now , he thought . He 'd been in this state for so long he does n't even remember . But the love he had for her and her late mother still flourished . His heart beat heavily as she stood into his vision . His mind cut in and out . `` You were always there ... I wished you could have walked me down the aisle ... You 'd love your granddaughter ... '' He wanted to cry but could n't . `` I 'll never forget you , daddy , '' she whispered as she bent down to kiss his cheek . The warmth of her lips and tears caressed the side of his face . He felt her lips quiver as the need to cry , touch and kiss her back like a father should filled his soul . As she stood he heard a click and the room slowed to silence . No beeps . No pumps . Just him and his daughter . `` Good bye , daddy . I love you so much . '' She held his hand until the end . Just then he knew , while the room faded to darkness , with his daughter in sight he knew : only she said she loved him .
`` Albie , come here . I have something to tell you . '' She yelled up his stairs to his room . It is so unusual of him not to respond . They broke up yesterday , and it was all because he was moving too fast for her . Or so she thought . He said he loved her . She walked up to his room , slowly . He wasnt laying in his bed . Maybe he was in the bathroom , she thought . So she knocked on the door , and it moved open , and in the mirror she found Albie hanging from the shower curtain rod , still and motionless . She screamed at the top of her lungs `` Albie ! No , no , no ! Please , God no ! '' She took his head out of self fashioned noose , and layed him down on the ground . She sat for a second , silent . Then , she only said she loved him . Over and over again , with tears rolling down her face , she only said she loved him
He felt gone . Nothing was left now that she had left . They had been together since they met one day at the cafe across from his office . His job was slightly classified . Her job was teaching a class , of kindergarteners . It seemed like love at first sight . Serendipity . She had waved him over to her table when he chose , for the first time in months , to steo out for lunch . She was a tourist from one of the outer boroughs , stopping between attractions . They loved the same things . She was beautiful . He was smitten . They had dinner that night . They saw shows on Broadway that weekend . The night before she had to leave , she said she loved him . He said he loved her . He gave her what was , between the two of them , the most romantic gift possible : A multi-line pass to ride the trains into the city when she had time . They spent every vacation together ; he would spend his few days off visiting her , she would spend most weekends and scheduled no-class days visiting him . On long weekends , they went up north . One day , he got a call from the front desk of his office . She was here . She was waiting for him in the cafeteria on a guest pass . He feared something horrible , and rushed down . It was mixed news ; she was pregnant . To him , it was good news . He dropped to one knee and proposed on the spot . They were both overjoyed . She bought some bottles of sparkling cider from the commissary and he took her up to his office . His co-workers congratulated him on the catch that they were finally meeting . They went to his office to videochat his family from his mobile before his lunch hour ended . It never happened . He woke up on the carpet of his office , a spilled plastic cup of cider in his hand , a bitter taste in his mouth , and a sticky note on his forehead . `` Thanks for getting me past the air-gap , comrade . P.S . : I was on the pill . '' He loved her . She only said she loved him .
`` Come on , now , Danny '' Ella cooed from the driver 's side . `` Just do it . '' Danny 's mouth twitched . `` But they didn't- I mean , I know they *said* , but -- '' Ella 's glare cut him off . `` I hope you remember what I told you about these people . I thought I already talked to you about that . '' Danny 's hand moved to a spot on the back of his shoulder . `` Maybe we 'll see to that when we get home . Especially your tone . '' Danny 's eyes darted toward the door , his hand inched toward the front compartment of his backpack . `` So what are you going to do to those people , Danny ? '' `` I 'm going to ... make them hurt . '' `` And why are we doing that ? '' `` Because they hurt us ... tried to make me think you did n't love me . '' `` Now go . There 's no reason to be so attached to these people . '' Danny pulled the gun out of his backpack . He pulled his mask on , and tried to open the door , but his cold hands fumbled on the lock . Heavy feet carried him up the doorstep and a cold left hand used a gold key to open a thick wooden door . Bullets flew into the livng room , hitting an old married couple , and probably injuring a young man who looked like the guy Danny saw in the mirror sitting next to them . Danny did n't know if they were dead or going to die , he got the hell out of dodge . Ella climbed into the driver 's seat and followed Danny . He got into the car a block away from the house . Ella smiled at Danny , and repeated her classic line . She said only she loved him .
In a sea of familiar faces just one pair of eyes met his without loathing . Only she stood up as the terrible question ended . Straight were her shoulders , without any mincing apology ; she stood if she could not feel the hundreds of stares riveting themselves to her person . A low snicker -- somewhere in the crowd -- set off a round of chuckling ... snide sounds that stole up from the ground and rose to the judgement seat . `` Anyone else ? '' the general hazarded , casting a rheumy eye over the crowd . The solitary standing form remained alone , but the condemned man did n't notice the crowd 's absence , only who stood . In his mind all the years of words spoken , conversations had and speeches made drained away , replaced by a single , silent act of courage . Only *she* said she loved him .
When it came down to divying up the final count of the man , separating and organizing the matter of his life , there were 3 people in charge . Three people who did n't know him very well , but not for lack of trying or circumstance . One was his daughter , another his wife and the third his mother.They did n't know him because , as it turned out , he wasnt a person who could be known . Even sorting through his house , where he alone had ended up living , gave no hints as to who the man was . It was n't that the place was sparse or unfeeling . It contained all one would normally expect in a perfectly normal house : a bed , a desk , lamps , tables , chairs and decoration . And taken individually you could say that this piece spoke to his love of this or that style . But now the house seemed so varied as to make a gruel of his preferences . There was nothing //diffinitive// about it anymore . His taste in a lamp , if such a thing decries a man , could be said to lend him a frivoulous air . But his bedroom and kitchen painted him as the industrial sort . His bathroom as funny and playful . And on , and on , until the three women felt the strings of sanity losening at the edges whenever they tried to imagine just who they had failed to know so completely . If the circumstances around his death had been different so would their predicament . They would have simply ripped through the belongings , divying them up as they thought appropriate . Remembering little moments that each item called forth : when they had bought this thing on that warm Sunday afternoon ; laughing at the time they almost broke this or that thing ; how he had thrown that cat into the snow after it pissed on this pillow ( only to go trudging out in search of it an hour later ) . The dinners , the late night cuddles on the couch , how he 'd lock himself away in this office for hours , coming out in a sweating panick , hair twisted into off ends , reaking of stale cigarette smoke and wine . Even though they had grown apart over the years , they had always held an idea of him in their head . One without contest , or much varieation or intricacy . They held this notion right up until the moment he was found sitting in his old office , shorter by 6 inches , his `` head '' an open sore above his lower jaw . Right up until the letter , mirculously void of any gore , was opened and read . `` There is only one thing left to do for me here , if ever a thing was to be done . And it is not a nice thing . It is , in fact , quiet cruel . But as far as things go it is possibly the only thing I have done for many , many years . What you had seen as a man ; walking , talking and motioning at love , was actually a corpse . A living , breathing , rotting vessel . Devoid of light and life , yet kept dancing by the unseen strings of society . Propt up on notions of what 's proper and `` good '' for a man to do . And while I do n't directly prescribe to `` goodness '' , it has still somehow kept this body tethered here . Maybe for some small ember of hope that life would reveal meaning at some point , but probably because I could n't care one way or the other . Death seemed as oblivous as life , and I simply felt that neither circumstance would make much difference to my actual being . So why not ere on the side of assumed correctness ? Why not give breathing the benefit of the doubt ? Yet there I sit . Most likely covered in my own brain matter , with you likely covered in shock . Your every notion of mortality challenged . And I must say I envy you . You who were able to buy the ticket and take the ride . To hold the dueling opinion that life is both ridiculous and worthwhile ... Or maybe not . Maybe you are just wilfully ignorant . Maybe you 've have blinded yourself long ago . Maybe you never opened your eyes . I did once . And only once . And that was enough to shut them again for good . As a boy I 'd met a girl . And as boys do I fell into what they call love . And I had thought , for one burning year , that this was what life was for : finding just one other thing that could make the thing you were more sensical . Something that reached between the physical layers of `` self '' to reveal a true nature of being . One where we were n't so alone . One where a person was not just a person , but a thing alive and connected . I felt seen . And connected . And while I first thought this sentiment mythical , and above my understanding , and therefor `` right '' in the way your parents are right when you 're a little kid , it turned out I had confused the notion entirely . It wasnt the sentiment that made up the feeling . It was simply feelings strung together to make sentiment . And that sentiment was expressed in a few simple words that I had cherrished saying and hearing until the eventual realization that sounds falling from a mouth do n't equate to some mystical reasurring function . They do n't really equate to anything but the filling up of a balloon . Because while I have only ever 'loved ' her , for the brief moment of my existence where such a thing was possible , she said she loved only him '' .
How could she do this to me ? The cold-hearted bitch . I had given everything I had to her . I helped her study through high school , carried her books when they were too heavy , gave her a shoulder to cry on when her boyfriends dumped her . I loved her and deep down inside I knew she loved me as well . She just did n't know how to show it . I was the only one with her through her times of need . I was the first one she called if she ever needed anything . All I ever wanted in return was for her to say I love you . Of course it never came . I realize now she was too stupid to know what she had with me . No man could ever treat her the way I treated her , the countless gossip sessions , the late night finger painting . Only someone deeply in love would ever do something like that and still she could n't see it . Well after tonight it wo n't matter anyway . I 've heard her say the line way too many times . I 'm tired of hearing her saying it . I 'm tired of the laughs and stupid smiles she gives me when I say I love you . It was always the same answer , she would say she only loved him and yet I 've seen the him change tens of times . I guess she 'll never notice me if I 'm gone . She said she only loved him but I always loved her and I just ca n't take it anymore .
The cold hard surfaces that lined the lab walls cruelly reflected the pained features of Dr. Emilia Fotzberg , as she was dragged from the facility by khaki coloured grunts . Dr. Stellinger looked at her being pulled from the patient holding area with his sunken , beady eyes . He looked around at the group associates once the calls of the former doctor had receeded ; `` We proceed with phase two immediately . '' he said . There was a flurry of activity , so abuzz as to look disorderly , yet clinical and precise . `` I m-must raise objection to the treatment of Dr. Fotzberg , '' one of the associates blurted `` surely you can understand the gravitas of all of this to her ? '' . Dr. Stellinger sneered at the associate , eying him with cold , calculating malice . `` I see no reason for your objection , '' replied the doctor `` afterall , she only said she loved him . ''

I won the championship last year by using a combination of creativity and difficulty . I traveled back to April 30th , 1945 , the day Hitler committed suicide . I knew that if I could get to him before he had a chance to kill himself , I could prevent him from ever taking his own life . So , I devised a plan . I snuck into the bunker where Hitler was staying and hid in the shadows . When Hitler entered the room , I quickly grabbed him and held him at gunpoint . I then proceeded to interrogate him , asking him questions about his life and his plans for the future . After a few minutes , I realized that Hitler was not going to give up easily . So , I decided to take a more creative approach . I began to tell him stories about the future , stories of a world without him , a world in which his legacy was forgotten . I could see the fear in his eyes as I spoke . Eventually , he broke down and begged me to let him go . I refused , and instead , I told him that he had to take his own life in order to save the world from his tyranny . Hitler reluctantly agreed , and I watched as he took his own life . I had won the championship by using a combination of creativity and difficulty .

Finally , I used a combination of explosives and poison gas to assassinate Hitler in his bunker . It was a daring and dangerous mission , but it paid off in the end . I was able to take out Hitler and win the championship .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 30 , 1945 , the day Adolf Hitler committed suicide . I had to be creative to outsmart the other time travelers , so I decided to use a bit of misdirection . I arrived in Hitler 's bunker and made sure to leave no trace of my presence . I then created a distraction by setting off a small explosion outside the bunker . This drew the attention of the guards and Hitler 's inner circle , giving me the opportunity to sneak into his private quarters . Once inside , I quickly found Hitler 's gun and made sure to leave no fingerprints . I then placed the gun in Hitler 's hand and positioned his body in a way that made it look like he had killed himself . The distraction had worked perfectly and I was able to escape without being noticed . I had successfully changed history and earned the championship title .

I won last year 's time travel competition by coming up with the most creative and difficult way to kill Hitler .

Once we reached the summit , I would push him off the edge , ensuring his death . The difficulty of this plan was that I had to find a way to convince Hitler to take the vacation in the first place . To do this , I had to research his life and find out what he was interested in . I found out that he was an avid skier and enjoyed the outdoors . I then used this knowledge to create a convincing story about a skiing trip in the Swiss Alps . I was able to convince him to take the trip and the rest was history .

I won the championship last year by taking a very creative and difficult approach . I decided to go back to the year 1933 and find a way to stop Hitler from ever coming to power . I knew that I had to be careful and not do anything that would drastically alter the timeline , so I decided to use subtle methods . First , I visited the offices of the Nazi party and spread rumors that Hitler was a fraud and a con artist . I also spread rumors that he was a coward and a weak leader . I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the party , so that they would spread it to the rest of the party . Next , I visited the offices of the German President , Paul von Hindenburg , and spread rumors that Hitler was a dangerous and unstable man who should not be trusted with power . I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the government , so that they would spread it to the rest of the government . Finally , I visited the homes of important people in the Nazi party and government and planted evidence that Hitler was a fraud and a con artist . I also planted evidence that he was a coward and a weak leader . These subtle tactics worked and Hitler never gained the power he wanted . I was able to win the championship by using a creative and difficult approach that did n't drastically alter the timeline .

Last year , I decided to take a different approach to winning the championship . Instead of attempting to go back in time and kill Hitler , I decided to go back to the early 1930 's and try and prevent Hitler from ever coming to power in the first place . My plan was to find a way to discredit Hitler and undermine his rise to power . To do this , I used a combination of tactics . First , I infiltrated the Nazi party and spread propaganda against Hitler . I also spread rumors and lies about his past , character , and beliefs . Second , I used my knowledge of future events to sabotage Hitler 's political ambitions . I used my knowledge of the future to reveal information that could end Hitler 's political career . I also used my knowledge of history to point out the flaws in Hitler 's plans , and how they could lead to disaster for Germany . Finally , I worked to build up other political figures in Germany that could challenge Hitler 's rise to power . I helped to finance and support other political parties and candidates , and worked to ensure that they had the resources and support they needed to compete with Hitler . My plan worked , and I was able to successfully prevent Hitler from gaining power in Germany .

She felt safe and secure with him , and she could finally open her heart again . She knew he felt the same way , and she wanted to express her feelings . So she took a deep breath and said those three little words : `` I only love you . ''
He had been waiting for her to say those words for years , but when she finally said them , she said them only with hesitation . They had known each other since they were children , but the love they shared had n't been the same since they had grown up .

He had finally gotten the closure he needed and he was ready to move on . He gave her one last hug and said his goodbye . `` She said she loved him , only , '' he thought as he walked away .

Alice was a bit scared , but she stepped closer and saw a small door in the tree . She opened the door and stepped inside , finding a small room with a single chair in it . The voice spoke again , this time more clearly . `` Welcome , Alice . I am the Spirit of the Tree and I have a gift for you . '' Alice was amazed and asked what the gift was . The Spirit of the Tree told her that he could grant her one wish , and that whatever she wished for would come true . Alice thought for a moment , and then wished for the courage to face her fears and take risks . The Spirit of the Tree smiled and said , `` Your wish is granted . '' Alice thanked the Spirit of the Tree and left the tree , feeling more confident than ever before . She knew that no matter what challenges she faced in the future , she would be able to face them with courage and determination . Alice 's adventure had only just begun .

The city of Alveron was a strange place . Everyone had some sort of power , from telekinesis to electrokinesis , and everyone was ranked according to the strength of their power . I was the highest ranked , but no one knew what my power was . I had been living in Alveron for as long as I could remember , but I had never revealed my power . I kept it hidden , not wanting to use it for fear of what might happen . The city was rife with violence , and many people had been killed in attempts to gain rank . I had managed to stay at the top of the rankings by avoiding direct conflict and by keeping my power secret . I was content with my life and was determined to stay at the top . One day , however , I was confronted by someone who had heard rumors about my power . He was determined to find out what it was , and he threatened to kill me if I did n't reveal it . I had no choice but to fight . I manifested my power , a power that no one had seen before . It was a power of pure energy , a power that could manipulate matter and energy on a molecular level . I used it to protect myself and defeat my opponent . The people of Alveron were shocked . No one had seen such a power before , and I was quickly given the highest rank . Everyone wanted to know what my power was , but I kept it hidden . I spent the rest of my life in Alveron , using my power to protect those I cared about and to keep the peace . My secret was safe , and I was content with my life .
I won last year 's championship by taking a creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . Instead of simply shooting him , I decided to use my time travel abilities to travel back to the year 1939 and set up a series of events that would lead to Hitler 's death in his own bunker . I began by traveling to Munich and infiltrating the Nazi party . I quickly rose through the ranks and began to gain Hitler 's trust . I then set up a series of events that would eventually lead to Hitler 's death . First , I sabotaged a few of Hitler 's speeches and military plans , making sure that his plans would fail . I also set up a few assassination attempts that were unsuccessful , but would make Hitler paranoid . Finally , I arranged for a group of resistance fighters to attack Hitler 's bunker in April 1945 . The attack was successful , and Hitler died in his own bunker . By taking this creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler , I was able to win the championship .

You can also be a reminder of the power of imagination and how even when things seem impossible , anything can be achieved with a little bit of creativity and determination .

The sun had just set , and the sky was painted a deep orange . She watched , mesmerized , as the day slowly faded away . Her thoughts were a million miles away , and she felt a sense of peace . She reminisced about a simpler time , when life was free of worry . Her heart was full of joy , and she smiled a gentle smile . She remembered the laughter of her childhood , and the love of her family . In that moment , she was content . She was home . Bliss .

The peace was broken , a seagull 's cry . She opened her eyes , disappointment . He stood , a smile on his face . He bent down , a kiss , goodbye . Alone .
She said she loved him only , but he knew it was n't enough . For years , he had been in love with her , but she had never returned his affections . He had been content to settle for her friendship , until one night when she shared her feelings for him . His heart soared , but he knew it would be short-lived . He had a secret that he had been keeping from her , one that he was certain would make her take back her words . He had to tell her , despite the fear that it would ruin everything .

He was filled with an overwhelming sense of relief , and he knew that no matter what , he would never forget her kindness .

I started to look at the world differently , seeing beauty and possibility in everything . I felt connected to the people around me , and I started to feel more connected with myself . I was finally able to appreciate the little things in life and even find humor in the mundane . I am now so grateful for the person who donated their happiness to me . It has changed my life in ways that I could never have imagined . I now understand what it means to be truly happy and I am so thankful for the opportunity to experience it .
I won the championship last year by using a combination of creativity and difficulty . My plan was to travel back to the early 1940s , when Hitler was in the middle of his campaign for power . I knew that if I could disrupt his rise to power at the right time , it would be enough to prevent the horrors of the Nazi regime from ever occurring . My first step was to travel back to the time when Hitler was about to make his famous speech in Munich in 1938 . I waited in the shadows until he began to speak , then I shouted out a warning to the crowd , telling them to be wary of the man they were about to listen to . The crowd was confused and the speech was quickly interrupted . My second step was to travel back to the 1932 election , when Hitler was running against Hindenburg for president . I planted fake news stories in the local newspapers that exaggerated Hitler 's involvement in criminal activities . This created a scandal that caused Hitler to lose the election . My third step was to travel back to 1923 , to the time of Hitler 's failed coup attempt . I released information that exposed the corruption and misdeeds of the Nazi party , which caused the coup to fail completely . My final step was to travel back to the early days of the Nazi party , when they were still a small fringe group . I used my knowledge of the future to set up a secret network of informants and spies that infiltrated the Nazi party and provided me with detailed information about their plans and activities . This enabled me to disrupt their operations and ultimately prevent them from ever coming to power . With my plan complete , I returned to the present and was crowned the champion of the Time Travelers ' Killing Hitler tournament .

Prologue . The sun was setting on a crisp autumn night in the small town of Oakridge . The sky was a deep navy blue , and the stars twinkled in the darkness . The air was still and quiet , the only sound being the occasional chirp of a cricket . It was the perfect night for a walk . Willow , a young woman in her early twenties , had been feeling restless all day . She had been living in Oakridge for almost a year now , but it still felt unfamiliar . She had been itching for an adventure , something to break up the monotony of her everyday life . So , when the sun began to set , she grabbed her coat and set off on a stroll through the town . She walked past the old brick buildings and the quaint little shops , and she felt a sense of peace wash over her . As she walked , she noticed a small , dimly lit alleyway tucked between two of the buildings . Curiosity got the better of her , and she decided to investigate . The alleyway was empty , save for a single door at the far end . Willow approached the door , and to her surprise , it was unlocked . She stepped inside , and the door shut behind her with a thud . The room she found herself in was dark and musty . She could see the faint outline of a desk and chair in the corner , but other than that , the room was empty . As her eyes adjusted to the darkness , she noticed a large wooden chest sitting in the center of the room . Willow stepped forward and lifted the lid of the chest . Inside were a pile of old , yellowing documents . She grabbed one of the documents and began to read . What she read changed her life forever .

No matter what happens , I will continue to live in my city and protect the innocent people within it .

The city of my residence was populated with people with remarkable powers - telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , and more - that kept it humming with activity . I was the most powerful of them all , yet no one knew what my power was . Upon this hidden power , I was crowned the # 1 rank . From there , the pecking order fell among the other gifted citizens . Moving up in rank was an elusive concept , as no one could advance their status without overturning another who had obtained it before them . It was an eternal cycle of gaining power by murdering another . The thought of killing a fellow citizen to accomplish my goal was appalling . Yet , the higher ranks seemed to have accepted the fact that it was a necessary evil in a city overflowing with powerful people . Some even embraced it as an opportunity to increase their own rank and influence . I continued to largely remain aloof , never bearing my power or attempting to take the higher rank . I had no intention of taking another 's life , especially of those powerful citizens who had obtained their rank through hard work and ambition . However , as the years went on , my power remained a mystery . People whispered and speculated about the nameless person at the top of the leaderboards , but no one could answer what it was that put me there . Eventually , I had to accept the fact that I was never going to reveal my power , or even make any efforts to advance in rank . I just wanted to watch and observe this unique , powerful city and its citizens . I continued to live peacefully in my position at the top , watching from a distance and taking pleasure in the beauty and seeming harmony that surrounded me . I hoped that the citizens of the city would be able to use their powers for greater good instead of for personal gain . I was content simply living anonymously as the mysterious , most powerful citizen in the city .

Prologue . The sun slowly began to set in the horizon , and the amber rays of light started to slowly fade away . The wind blew through the air and with it carried the sweet smell of lilac and honeysuckle . Brandon looked out of the window of his cabin , his heart heavy with an unspoken dread that had been weighing on him for months .

He had made it his own over the past few months , considering it a home , a safe place to escape his past . But it was starting to feel somewhat like a prison , with no way out . Trying to shake the feeling of dread , Brandon walked over to the kitchen and ran his fingers along the counter , taking in the warmth of the wood beneath his touch . He looked around the room , as if an answer could be found within its walls , as if his doubts and fears could materialize in front of him , and he would be able to confront them , and be able to run away from them forever . But the only thing he could hear , aside from his own shallow breath , was the gentle rustle of the wind , and the calming sound of leaves rustling outside the window . Brandon sighed and turned away from the kitchen , walking out of the front door and into the fading light of the day , when suddenly something caught his eye . A small piece of paper was lying on the ground . He stooped to pick it up , and his eyes widened as he read what had been written on it . Just a few words , but it was enough to make him gasp . He clutched the paper tightly in his hands , as if it could shield him from the shadows of his past , and ran back inside the cabin , his mind racing . He had finally found the answer he had been searching for , a way out of his dark and troubled past . But with this newfound hope also came a fear , a fear of what lay ahead . He took a deep breath , his heart pounding in his chest , and he knew . No matter what the future brought , he was ready .

I won champion of killing Hitler last year by traveling to April 20th , 1945 and completely taking over the Fuhrerbunker . I emptied the bunker of all soldiers and personnel and then replaced them with my own loyal crew of prisoners .

It was n't easy , but I managed to pull it off without any casualties and the judges awarded me points for both creativity and difficulty . It took a lot of planning , strategy , and organization , but in the end I am glad that I was able to put an end to the nightmare of Hitler 's reign and win the championship for killing him .
Once upon a time there lived an old man named Jacob . He lived alone in an old cottage on the outskirts of a small village , away from the hustle and bustle of city life . Jacob had lived there for as long as anyone could remember and people in the village spoke of him with reverence and admiration . His small cottage was a calm , peaceful refuge from the chaotic world outside . Jacob would often spend his days tending to the small garden he kept or watching the birds fly by . He was always thoughtful and kind , and those who visited him found peace in his presence . One day , while tending to his garden , Jacob discovered a small bird with a broken wing .

Prologue . The familiar , yet intense aroma of freshly brewed coffee permeated the air of the busy city as three figures ventured out into the cool , autumn night . A light , gentle breeze blew through the streets and the echoing of footsteps filled the otherwise peaceful silence in the still of the night . The three individuals walking side by side , though only acquaintances , seemed to share an unspoken bond that few could understand . A bond that had been forged through their shared experiences of the past and their mutual understanding of the events that had transpired . The streets were filled with an uncanny energy that seemed to be beckoning them towards their destiny . It was as if a hidden force had guided them to this very spot , as if they wanted to be here and nothing else would do . With determination in their eyes and a sense of purpose in their hearts , the trio walked together into the darkness , ready to embark on a journey that none of them could have ever expected . Where their destination lay , none could be certain . But one thing was for sure , the night had brought them something unexpected , something that demanded their attention and offered up its secrets . As the wind danced around them , carrying with it the mysterious energy of the night , the group embraced the unknown and looked expectantly into the future , ready to begin this new adventure .
The bright chirp of birds greeted me as I opened the window . An unfamiliar breeze caressed my face , breathing life into my soul . I peered out and the beauty of nature took my breath away . In the quiet of this moment I found peace , a stillness that eluded me . I inhaled the crisp scent of freshness and exhaled the dullness of my worries . Life seemed suddenly filled with possibility , hope rising within me . Smiling , I embraced the feeling . Joy .
The moment Mary stepped onto the beach of her hometown , she felt a wave of nostalgia and comfort wash over her . She had n't seen the rolling hills meeting the vast ocean in what felt like a lifetime . The summer days that quickly melted into night had become so distant . Charlotte , their crush on Nathan , the years of kite flying , and jumping into the glassy water ; all of it seemed almost like a dream . Yet , here she was – running her toes in the sand , she drew a deep breath and turned towards something she was both afraid of and excited for . Mary stepped off the beach , towards the future she had made for herself .
The sun was setting quickly , turning the horizon a deep crimson . Fear crept in with the darkness , a tangible tremor in the air . Her feet carried her faster , willing the safety of home to arrive . Through alleyways she ran , hiding away in shadows when she heard noise . Suddenly , a figure emerged from around a corner , silently following her . She squeezed her eyes shut , lips muttering a desperate plea . Suddenly , her path cleared and a door appeared , her safe haven . Relief . Escape .
The sun shone brightly through the window , lighting up the room in a warm , golden hue . He was already awake despite the early hour , lying quietly in the stillness of the morning . His gaze was fixed on the ceiling , thoughts racing and drifting in careless , chaotic swirls . He wondered if it would ever be the same again – their friendship , the laughter , the good times – or was it all gone , swept away in a turbulent tide of misunderstanding and harsh words ? Slowly he swung his feet over the edge of the bed and standing , he crossed the room to the window . Pulling back the curtains , he watched as the sun continued to climb into the sky , its rays gradually warming the air around him . He closed his eyes , inhaling deeply , a sudden peace settling within him that he had n't felt in years . The decision was made - it was time to forgive . Hope .
It was always assumed I was the most powerful person in the city . Everyone else had their powers , telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , all the trends you 'd expect . But here I was , untouchable , untitled , veiled in mystery . I kept it that way , too . I never wanted anyone to know what kind of power I had , if any . I wanted to remain a shadow , a ghost amongst them , watching , but never being noticed . But then I had to end it all . I was on the brink of a great war and the stakes were high : I either annihilate my adversaries , or they would annihilate me . I knew the only way to stay one step ahead would be to take out the competition . So , I set out to do just that . I used my unknown power to dispatch each of the competitors , carefully and skillfully avoiding detection . Before long , I had taken out the entire chain of command , one by one , and soon , I was the only one left standing . I was the number one in the city and no one knew what my power was . That pleased me just fine . As far as everyone else was concerned , I was the most powerful person in the city and no one dared challenge me . I kept my secret to myself and that 's how I maintained my dominance . It was a strange and lonely kind of existence but I was content with it . I was finally safe , and I could finally end this arbitrary competition that had pitted us all against each other for so long . So , I vowed to remain in my place , the invisible protector and guiding light of the city . I refused to use my power for anything but protection and no one ever questioned my supremacy .

There had been rumors among the people of the city for years ; whispers of a secret , unex-plainable power . It was something no one was able to understand , something no one had ever seen before . It was the power of the one they had simply come to call ‘ Number One ’ . Nobody knew who Number One was , not even Number One themselves . Every attempt to find out had been fruitless ; for the inhabitants of the city , Number One was unreachable , unassailable , and feared . The city was full of those with extraordinary abilities , from levitation to electrokinesis and beyond , and each person was assigned a rank based on their power level . Ranking number one was a position that had been empty more than it had been filled , as no one had been able to reach that level of strength until now . It seemed as though no one was ever going to get close to Number One ’ s level of power , and the people of the city had all but given up hope . That was until something strange started to happen . People higher than Number One ’ s rank started turning up dead , drained of all the power they had acquired . Rumors circulated quickly and soon it became crystal clear ; somehow , someone was killing the people of higher rank in order to obtain their power . Outraged , the city ’ s leaders attempted to put a stop to the carnage by launching a manhunt for its perpetrator . With each death , it became a little more obvious that Number One was the one behind the killings . Yet , no one had any real proof and the mystery of their identity remained unsolved . Then , one day , a group of brave individuals ventured deep inside the city ’ s sewers in search of the truth . After hours of searching , they finally came face to face with the power behind the murders ; it was Number One . The group discovered that Number One ’ s power was something far greater than anyone else ’ s . It was the power to teleport , to move between places instantaneously . With this power , Number One had been able to silently drain away the power of those of higher rank and take it as their own . After this discovery , all of the people of the city were in shock ; they had never seen power like this before . Despite the law , many in the city came to respect and admire the mysterious power of Number One

I awoke with a start , the early morning sun shimmering in my eyes . My groggy mind foggy and unclear , yet my heart was full of anticipation . Dreams of glory , honour and success , all of which I would yet achieve . My bliss was soon to be shattered , as reality came in quick succession . The bed was too hard , the room too small , my energy felt sapped away . A sense of dread crept upon me ; this was n't the place I belonged . The feeling of helplessness was hard to bear , so I decided to take action . The clock ticked , now the time was nigh , I had to take a stand . Rising from that room and going forth into a new life ahead . Bravely I embraced all the possibilities , seeking the path less travelled . The journey was taxing , the route complicated and toil relentless . But my desire kept me going , toward the promised land I saw . The hardships were surpassed , the goals set became achievements . Success had come but at a price and I felt numb to it all . A moment of respite , peace in a veil of quietude . Thoughts of complacence , yet a will to explore more . Swallowing the pain , I pushed onward , determined to explore . A whisper of hope , a flicker of life all I had left to rely on . Fear ...

I soon realised that happiness was contagious , as it was being passed around to others and bringing out the best in them .

I knew I had changed for the better , as I could now see the beauty in the world around me . I was no longer without emotion , as I had discovered the beauty of warmth , pleasure , and joy .

Marilyn Tyler stared at the tangled knot of metal caught up in the bushes outside her window . She knew it was her brother ’ s bike , but how it had gotten here , she had no idea . She had been planning on calling him to ask just that very question when she noticed something odd about the bike . Closer inspection revealed that it was no ordinary bicycle – it was a vintage Raleigh Superbe from the 1940s . The fenders , handlebars , and frame were old-fashioned , and the signature wheel tricolor paint job was unmistakable . She vaguely remembered her brother mentioning he ’ d picked up a vintage off of Craigslist a few weeks ago , but he ’ d never mentioned it being this special . Marilyn excitedly threw on a coat and went outside to investigate the bike further . With gentle care she managed to loosen the binding and pulled the bike free from the mass of leaves and branches . She brushed off the seat and handlebars and looked for a serial number , which she found engraved on the back wheel hub . Using the serial number , she was able to determine that the Raleigh Superbe had been manufactured in 1946 and belonged to a young man back in England . Bemused by this serendipitous find , Marilyn thought of the incredible journey the bike had gone on to land in her hands . She gently rolled the bike back up onto the street and glanced around the quiet suburb , trying to imagine the previous owner of the bike . Maybe the previous owner was the rich , adventurous type , and had ridden around the world on this very bike . Or maybe he had ridden it on countless trips to the local cafe as a young man . Marilyn would never know the story behind the vintage Raleigh Superbe , but it was nice to dream . As she watched its tires spin in the late autumn light , she already felt a connection to the bike . As if in a sign of approval , the sun caught the fading tricolor wheel paint and sent a tiny rainbow dancing across the damp street . Feeling a sudden assurance , Marilyn smiled and decided that was the day she ’ d finally write her novel .

The next day , I set out to spread the donated joy and found out quickly that good deeds like that can come back around . I found that once I gave out the gift of happiness , it returned to me in the forms of smiles , hugs , and kind words . I now know that true happiness is found in the small things we do for each other everyday . I 've been passing on the donation of happiness every since and it 's made all the difference in my life .
I woke up with a start . I looked around my small one bedroom apartment . I had lived here my whole life , yet today it felt different . I felt a surge of power in me , a power that I had never felt before . I felt a chill run down my spine as I got out of bed , as if something was calling out to me . Something big was about to happen , I could feel it inside me . I was the only one living in my city who was rank # 1 , but nobody knew what my power was . Little did they know , that my power was something that not even the strongest of warriors could match up to . I made my way to the window and peered out . My city was bustling with activity . Citizens were walking their dogs , couples strolling through the park , children laughing as they played , it all seemed so normal . But then I heard it : the sound of people fighting , of glass breaking , of screams of terror . Looking down , I saw a group of people , their hands glowing with energy as they fought each other . I felt drawn to the action like a moth to a flame . Without realizing it , I found myself at the door of my apartment , my heart racing . I wanted to fight and prove my power to the world - but I had to be smart . I had to protect myself and I knew that I could not expose my secret . I stepped out into the alley and watched as the fight progressed . I saw a woman with her fingers glowing with electricity , as she used her power to control the fight . I studied her movements , memorizing every one . Then , suddenly , I felt something shift inside me . I raised my hands , and before I knew it , I had zapped the woman , rendering her unconscious . I was shocked . What power did I possess ? My secret was finally out . All the citizens of my city were staring at me in awe and disbelief . I had taken down the strongest among them - the one who was rank # 1 - and gained my own rank through sheer willpower and strength . In that moment , I understood that my true power was believing in myself . No matter what obstacles I face , as long as I believe in my own strength , I can achieve anything .

The city of Metropolis was a bustling hub of activity , homed to people of all walks of life . However , one thing that set it apart from all other cities was its inhabitants ’ unique capabilities . While most of them were mundane enough - such as the ability to throw a ball further than anyone else , or to have a rubber hand that was both flexible and incredibly strong , some of these unique gifts were far more special . As it turns out , this city was the only place in the world known to harbour people with superhuman abilities , and whilst some of these were stealthy enough to go unnoticed , many of them were powerful enough to take over the entire city . In order to keep these varying powers in check , Metropolis adopted a ranking system . Everyone with a power was assigned a number from 1 to 10 , according to their power-level - with 1 being the most powerful . As a result , the identity of the number 1 ranked individual remained a mystery to mostly everyone , since it was far too dangerous to let one person dominate the city . You had been living in Metropolis for as long as you could remember , and had seen friends , family , and even acquaintances reach great heights of power - even becoming number 1 ranked . But you were not one of them . Despite never having a power showcased or revealed , you had curiously found yourself at the top of the ranking - as the number 1 . Everyone , including yourself , was absolutely baffled by it - what was your power ? And why wasn ’ t it shown ? No one seemed to have any answers - until one day , when you came face to face with challenger . Confidently , the challenger threw down the gauntlet at your feet , claiming that they had the power to kill an individual of a higher rank , and obtain their title in exchange . Your heart raced with dread and anticipation as you stared them down - what would happen if you were to lose ? When push came to shove , you did the only thing you could think of - you took a stab in the dark and revealed your secret . To your surprise and relief , it worked , and your challenger was left reeling , stunned with disbelief as you revealed that you had the power to manipulate the future . As the news of your power left the challengers lips , the streets of Metropolis were filled with complete awe and respect for the mysterious individual who had reached the highest possible ranking , without ever having to show how powerful
Last year I won the champion of time travelers by coming up with a deviously tricky way to kill Hitler . I had already considered the traditional ways ( shooting , poisoning , other assassinations ) but wanted to use my own special twist . So , I went back in time and disguised myself as a German messenger . I then successfully smuggled a live bat in the Fuhrer ’ s office . After Hitler was distracted and used up all the paper in the room to swat the bat away , I quickly and quietly locked the door behind me . For the next week , Hitler was trapped inside , running out of oxygen until he suffocated . After the week was up , I returned back to the present , winning the award and becoming the Time Travel Champion for creative and difficult assassination of Hitler .
You look at the person and are slightly taken aback as they look exactly like you . The person steps forward , and you feel a wave of shame and guilt wash over you . You recognize that this is the part of you that you have been avoiding out of fear and shame . The person looks you in the eyes and speaks softly , `` You do n't have to feel so ashamed . You have done wrong and wronged people . But , it is not too late to forgive yourself . You are worthy of forgiveness and a second chance . You can begin to repair your relationships with those you hurt and start fresh , with understanding and compassion .

Prologue The small , forgotten town of Kildale was whisper-quiet . They were so cut-off from the rest of the world that even cell phones had difficulty getting a signal , and the locals all went about their business without much interference from the outside world . It was a beautiful day as Bella set off for her usual walk to the outskirts of town , where she often found peaceful solace . The sun was just beginning to shine through the treetops and the fresh smell of morning dew surrounded her . There was something about this part of town that she had always found calming – it felt like the memories of a simpler time lingered throughout the air . She had n't realized how much time had passed as she slowly made her way down the winding lane until she reached the abandoned , dilapidated farmhouse . She had heard stories about the old house , tales of hauntings and strange occurrences . She had never felt a need to explore it , until now . There was something magnetic , almost calling to her . She approached the entrance and peered cautiously through the window . Darkness engulfed the inside of the house , and suddenly a chill ran down her spine . She had the feeling that something was watching her , though she couldn ’ t put her finger on what it was .

First Paragraph : The mountain pass howled and snarled as the ferocious storm raged on . Vivien pulled her cloak closer as she surveyed the hair-raising surroundings , hampered only by the tenuous stream of foggy moonlight each night . Last Paragraph : But with one final glance to the towering structure in front of her , Vivien steeled her nerves and took the plunge . A torch beckoned through the narrow entrance way ; the smell of smoke floated fragilely in the air , and a hush cut through the endlessness of the land . Vivien had begun her journey - a journey which revealed secrets in the depths of the mountain and unmasked her destiny .
It all began with a little bit of strategic preparation . I created a false background detailing my time machine experiences and spent hundred of hours conducting in-depth research of Adolf Hitler ’ s daily activities , travels , and security detail . Thought I had to be precise in my plan because change fate of the entire world could hinge on my ensuring my success . Six months of preparation was finally enough for me to take action . Late that summer , I set my sights on Adolf ’ s mountain retreat in Bavaria . It was sure to be the most hardened form of defense Hitler could muster . I figured that the safe house would be the weakest point and a well-orchestrated hit could break the military ’ s defenses open . But I didn ’ t come empty handed . I brought my own gun , with two bricks of dynamite hidden away in my backpack , hoping to give myself an explosive edge . As I approached the retreat I slowly worked myself up from the shadows and forest construct , I ’ d assessed during my reconnaissance . I then started to form my plan . I commenced a pair of guerrilla attacks and snuck up among the defending forces undetected . I worked myself through the chaos and distraction until my target was right underneath me . My objectives was twofold : detruction & evasion . By igniting the stash of explosives that I 'd stowed , I esscated potential consequence ofbeing discovered . And obviously , so that I could escape amid the destruction . But that was n't actually intended for Hitler ! So I had to get him out of there first . Still keeping to the shadows , an order came through the radio detailing Hitler 's imminent arrival . Now was my chance for re-entry : the moment the Fuhreer stepped outside for his address and harangue , I sacrificed by slightly lower position on the mountain for something a lot closer . The fresh air landing that was currently provided an unfurtuantes distraction . I felt a burst of adrenaline race through my veins as I pulled off the inexorable mission of one-off assassination that no historian remembers . In a startling wave of genius , I fired off efficient shots tempoararily paralyzing Hitler just as he utteredhis first line of speech - and although I witnessed the location in hindsight , the surprise attaining me valuable points in the contest . Ending without causalities , anyone what it which improbable happenings
The sun shone radiantly in the wide steel streets of the city . There was a hush of Electricity qui enveloped the whole metropolis , as people moved from one end to the other hurriedly and purposefully . No one stopped or stayed to take in the sights , they all moved as quickly and silently on their quest to get to whichever destination faster . But one person trudged slowly along the cobbled streets . This was Retanior , a unassuming young man who appeared of no greater measure than anyone else . He trudged lethargically yet surely , stopping occasionally to observe anything of particular interest until he reached the Fountain at the city center . Safely obscured by the dense foliage surrounding it , Retanior stopped and observed its miraculous beauty . Then , a female stepped up beside him . Right away , he recognized her as someone formidable ; her navy blue jumpsuit identifying her as Rank One - the supposed strongest of all in the City . Her figure then shifted , as reality then faded , replaced with icy void , her own presence retained only by her strong aura that Remannorian exuded an awkward air . He glanced at her with incredible surprise before bustling away , scared yet ecstatic , leaving only a distinctive glint in his eyes . He now knew why he had come to the City - he had heard rumours of power given to all its citizens , and of the Rankings held by the individuals . Apparently the one ranked number 1 was indisputably stronger than all the others , and finding out who it was would bring immense power , respected by all . He knew now that the Rank One was the mysterious woman at the Fountain . If one were to challenge her for ultimate supremacy they would then gain her strength and with it , obtain ultimate power . And this was exactly what he intended . Retanior wasted no more time . Unintimidated by even your own strength , the mysterious mustered his semblance of courage and approached her floating form . Surprisingly , she willingly agreed to what he said as replies were n't in wonderment , something far more sinister . A monumental crash broke the air not too soon after . Retanior jumped out of shock , unsurprised to duly see that the Rank One : the woman he had challenged , lay defeated at his feet . The paralysed Victoria lay still beneath the wreckage of her attempted attack . A cripping sensation passed faintly up Retanior 's

In the depths of the frost-shrouded Blackwoods , nestled between a rare grove of sporegumm trees , sat a little cottage so cautiously hidden that it was barely a whisper of a whisper that even the birds could not hear . It was assumed by those around it that the cottage had been around for generations , brought up over the years and passed down the generations in a comfortingly familiar way . Little did any of them know that there was a unique origin to the cottage and everything inside—days and even sometimes weeks away from the busy world , tucked away in the silent tree shadows to dwell and cook and thrive in . Despite its amusing tale , the little cottage was now famous for its impressive history of producing some of the greatest recipes in all of the land—crafted over many generations with such attention to detail and care that each bowl , meal , and pot of tea prepared was sure to tantalize any taster of such flavors . The skills within these strong kitchen walls had been carefully perfected with time and perfected each execution season after season . Elian Marrmon was the matriarch of the cottage , and rightly so - she knew more than most about these family recipes and appreciated nearly all flavors and ingredients to the art . She kept her orders hidden inside hollowed-out trees by her dwelling , and simply waited for the eagles to come and distant acquaintances to hear her distant call for orders . Luck it seemed must be of the infinite amounts as every year more and more people ventured to the small cottage—far beyond a reputable distance of miles and minds -- to try whatever odd dish Elian had created . It was known that her dishes consistently left the taste buds far yet in a wonderful sensation that no fork nor spoon could have possibly reached before . By all means , it could simply be eased dismissed as such quaint custom until a starry night arrived . This special night held everyone ’ s collective breath in anticipation , adjusting the weighted air with intrigue for the dinner Elian would present later on . On that evening , the cottage was bustling with small lightning bugs and the clamoring voices which finally , left silent as the night cooled and the stars began to shine through the distant window of the little house . Many delicacies were served which many find hard to believe as even Elian Marrimon wasn ’ t given to believing that whatever secretly grew behind her cottage walls could change such drinks and meals— causing the humble grounds to give life
Anna met a handsome young man a few weeks ago , and recently he had expressed the feelings that he was developing for her . She , for a moment felt the same way , and whispered those three little words only backwards , ydol ehs . He was taken by surprise , and her with her heart thudding , she could not help but smile as she realized that she said it , had confessed those words , only those without the proper intention and faith behind them remains shallow empty shadows of reality . She said she loved him only . But as reality demands her to use and rely on reason and judgement , she knew the right thing to do . With great difficulty , she forced the confessed feelings deep within and declared that what they shared was nothing but platonic and temporary ; almost forgetting that he did n't deserve such shallow treatment . Before her rose the man that left her with a broken heart . She tried to maintain her poise as she released the air that somehow made her go back to life , and spoke one last word before stepping out the door – an ultimatum that she had to define responsibility in their mutual absent oriented relationship : she said she loved him only . It was time to move on for both of them , for they shared something abstract and intangible that remained unfinished and unfulfilled and was never meant to be conjured out of ordinary . It was time to find what souls have been searching from distant times : the true and honest feeling required for eternity .

The day I found the box filled with emotion was unlike any other . I had just woken up that morning , feeling especially gray in my day . But this morning something was different - someone had made a donation of happiness . I sat down in front of the box , entranced . As if by an invisible force , my hand reached inside and I felt something warm and comforting . As I brushed my fingertips against it , electric currents pulsed through my body unlike anything I had ever experienced before - happiness . The joy that had been lying dormant inside of me suddenly burst free . Instinctively , I laughed - a deep , belly laugh of pure joy . I knew that no matter what happened , I held this one emotion in a protective embrace and I immediately wanted to spread it to the world . I began doing the only thing I knew - I gathered up as many of the donors ' emotions as I could and took it to my hometown on the other side of the city . There , I happily shared my gifts with those who needed it most - the sick , the unfortunate , the lonely , and the listlessly unfortunate . It might seem like a small gesture , but that one donation gift of happiness changed my life , and the lives of those around me . In that small donation I found belonging , and hope . That morning I was born a new person . I was born blessed and forever thankful for the gift of happiness that was bestowed upon me .
Prologue Sitting in the corner of the room the hilt of his sword stuck out from beneath the thinning bedsheets and tangled covers.The air smelt musty - a familiar smell . A sound emitted from beneath the warmth of the bed , almost too quiet to detect . It was uncertain . Sam waded through the blue sheets bouncing up against fabrics long forgotten in order to find the source . Glancing over , a figure seemed to be rolling back and forth breathing heavily and whimpering in short bouts like a dying soldier at the end of a great battle . He quickly tugged the blanket away to fully uncover the figure of a haggard man . His hair was on end . His skin pale at first , but a deep fleshtone was slowly seeping back into his face . Trying to dislodge the knots of delirium catently tangled from beneath the corners of his mind the man lays quiet . His eyes still carry echoes of disappointment . He stares directly with an intensity too concentrated for the world we live in . His words appear barely audible in the stillness of the room . Fear and sadness slowly engulfs the atmosphere ; a melancholic scent islet as the origins of frustrated strivings reminesce men seep into the room and gradually start circling - a wolf cries , panthers bellow , footsteps carry up past the ancient rocks , and the tales take hold of the attentive silhouettes . He explains with grit and veracious warmth his turbulent upbringing , the tainted dreams strewn like flags in the hurricane of her life , his worst betrayal and the intensity of unrequited emotions in his tumultuous tale . His capacity to survive appears infinite , from immolations , to persecutions , to regrets - all have managed to erect mountains of obstacles he climbs uncompromisingly . Descended through inherited glory and a restless curiosity this unusual hero stands channeling us all to go seek and search until we catch whatever truth is buggering with instincts of our secret selves . And with that , the curtains slowly spring forth sealing off a heavy yet inexplicable open ended dialogue . Sam 's feet comes uncomfortably close to the ground before gaining more elevation than expected . Absorbed in worlds , tales and winding dream sequences , a subtle smirk in receding trace smoothly spread the higher cheeks To be continued . . . Kicking off his ragged cloth shoes he enters a
Ferrin Aaron was never like the other kids . At six , he knew he wanted to pursue a life of adventure , something wild and exciting , although he had no idea what that meant exactly . It was as if the stars pointed the way to his destiny when a lamplighter accidentally upended a box of treasure maps from a dusty brass cart he 'd been pushing on his nightly route . The young child 's naïve eyes brightened at the thought as he marveled at the possibilities the colorful replications held . Taking a burning oil lantern , he navigated his way along the coastal stones to find the collections , not feeling the moist Zephyr that passed between . It was as if Ferrin Aaron had been pardoned and admitted to some sort of mythical realm fit for any courageous explorer . An inaudible chorus sang in harmony in his head as he carefully explored the cart , prodding and panning upon the enticing maps scrawled on weather-beaten paper in ancient calligraphy with mysterious meandering destinations where anything could happen . The bold child resolved to take on every assignment the maps outlined before nightfall . And like a sponge , Ferrin Aaron absorbed the vibrant history of the blurred tales who artists seen moments once forgotten held onto . From forgotten Indigenous roots rising of the Powhatan Nation to trekking across rivers filled with Chinese immigrants who sought that same yearning wealth of knowledge , he stroked through the wet testament assimilating every detail . He was ultimately welcomed with vast treasuries filled with puzzles to piece together into shapes that bound like secrets strewn in graphing expedition by the crews who 'd pour ink blots of patchy recollection along the alleyways and secrets found with clippings of legend unfamiliar into eternity . By nightfall , the brave little traveler had been back in the adventurous spirit and would keep true his nightfall plundering promise for thee years to come .
Once upon a time , there was a small village nestled amongst bright green orchards at the very outskirts of a kingdom . This remarkable village had beautiful cobblestone streets and brightly-colored cottages crafted from silky logs . The small , cozy community lived peacefully in harmony for many years , seemingly untouched by many of the difficulties plaguing the rest of the kingdom . But then one dreary night , an unnatural darkness fell upon the village . An evil cursed fog slowly began to creep out from the mouths of the boundary river that bordered the community , filling the night sky with a sinister sense of dread . The sudden appearance of this sinister fog sent every creature and alike scurrying for safety . Every inhabitant of the village desperately sought sanctuary in their homes , fearful of the unknown lurking within the cursed haze eventually enveloping it in its entirety . The next morning , the entire countryside was inundated in the eerie mist , and in its wake came spinning tales of strange facilities and practices occurring in the chillingly pale mist bordering the village . Some whispered about a potion-brewing laboratory , others told tales of skull-lined tombs and sick experiments , and even the bravest hearts among the village started to have horrific visions during their rest-ones so vivid and distressing that they were nearly beyond description . The entire village suffered night after night as the damp mist lingered , dragging its tentacles over the castle towers , wiping out villages neighboring it in mere moments with its hungry presence . Even in the face of all this terror and decay , the villagers of this magnificent village still chose to stay , boldly defying this cloud of oppressive terror draining all the life and light from their vibrant land and refusing to let the fear and darkness envelop them like it had so much of the neighboring area . Boldly , the residents began arming themselves and formed a Resistance Force to take direct and tangible action . Using their combined courage and magical knowledge , they started to wage their own war against the foul gas aiming to put an end to its terror . With each going day , a fear was beginning to manifest within the minds of all the inhabitants concerning the source of this devilish intrusion , prayed , nothing worse will burst forth from its clouds and wipe out what remained of this beautiful land ...
I won the competition last year due to a combination of creativity and careful planning . Knowing that I would need to come up with an original way to kill Hitler , I spent considerable time researching events leading up to April 1945 , when Hitler committed suicide . I immediately saw an opportunity in Wilhelm Keitel , a German field marshall who 's charges included arranging logistics and signals communications for the Wehrmacht . With the help of the time-travel machine , I tracked Keitel 's movements from April 1944 onwards . On the 2nd of April 1945 , I waited in hiding for Keitel at his command post . Approaching him as an old enemy made me nervous , but I wenti with it . I offered him what appeared to be a a surrender contract signed by Adolf Hitler . Dazzled , the marshall studied the contract , and as soon as his returned his gaze to meet mine , I gave him my most imposing stare . He felt threatened and reached for his service weapon . Knowing that any German Army soldier could 've simply shoot him on the spot for treason , Keitel finally put the clothes on the line and let go of his gun . After having him at my complete mercy , I arranged with him for Hitler 's unlikely demise . It was Keitel 's mission to transport a large amount of weapons grade uranium , which I ordered to be transported into the Fuhrer 's bunker instead . come When the red letter day finally arrived on April 30th , 1945 , Keitel carried out his orders without obstruction and Hitler 's bunker was filled with uranium contamination . Knowing of steps needed to save his own life , Hitler committed suicide and the world is now a different place . I 'll admit , it was a close call , but my strategy and timing got me the championship . Good thing Keitel did n't pull that trigger .

Once upon a time , there was a small country village tucked away in the rolling hills of a distant land . This village has been around for centuries , and many of the same traditions and customs that were observed on its founding still stand today . It is relatively small and undistanced , but what it lacks in scale it more than makes up for in charm . In this village , there is an old woman who lives alone in a small shack at the end of town . Though the old woman appears rather unassuming in her overalls and crabbed old straw hat , she is in multiple senses a large part of keeping the village safe and secure blessed with her mystic powers . The old woman ’ s name is Vaida , and her intention is to keep things how she found them : ancient and protected-like the village itself as time folded down around her . Decades have rolled on since Vaida first moved into her quirky little shack all those years ago , and she too has settled in contentedly with her sorcerous secrets . She spends her days in peace and occasionally partners with the other elders as a mystical sun -- bringer of light , solace , and occasionally overseeing in choice increments as fate should otherwise be relevant . Viada helps to conduct ceremonies for seekers of new directions and fulfillment , unseen masterclasses in temporal understanding performances , and assists in wisdom questioning at the local common house when times of deeper thinking or matters seek closer kinship arcs . And when tragedy strikes close to home , the warm spire of the old woman ’ s presence helps her neighbors mambo through mazes of heavy emotions and leave further steps glimpsed the other side . Treats it added complexity ably , binding moments together as blankets of new shiny tones . But despite Vaida 's heroic and magical qualities she still keeps to her own - preferring her daughter nature – obscure , undemanding , and significantly spectacularly delightful in her more normal capacities , and ever stirred most fiercely in the story writ of classic acceptance curvatures-kindra taken . She rattles tea storage containers in checkout at biodegradable shops on weekday evenings , arguing in vain for exactly correct parcel sizes and ticking prices wisely juggled – fun by left and selected sugary prices are all but effortless too . Indeed , it had seemed to the people of the village that Vaida was consuming most of her energy and providing her own kind of rather celestial prose into theirs , although selfishly and
You pause in shock before taking a few steps forward facing yourself . You discover that to forgive someone else , you must first learn to forgive yourself . You take a deep breath and gather your courage . You find yourself unexpectedly confessing to the mistakes and broken promises you have made , taking full accountability for everything you 've done even actions that have hurt others . As you ’ re saying every single word , you are filled with a sense of release , a soothing warmth coming over the entire area . An invisible source reaches out giving you the courage to face any ordeal ahead and the space to liberate those guilt boundaries that have held you hostage . You know in your heart that it is all a part of a healing process needed for your wings to soar and find the path that will eventually lead to the welcome door of Heaven . You bring your hands clasp together and with sincere contrition in your heart , you humbly apologize and accept responsibility . A profound sense of tranquility softly blossoms within as if freeing a heavier version of you and raising a lighter version in its place . In this magical moment with a beautiful sunshine , a tear , and a few complete thoughts of future expectation , you achieve a genuine contentment without any due remorse . This is the pathway of Heaven .
Little do I know , life is about to become much more challenging than ever before . Determining my response will require greater insight than I possess . I want so strongly to do the right thing , not making the decision lightly . Long talks start to unfold down in the deepest part of my mind ; winding dialogue and wild thoughts wage an inner fight . Who will have the answers I look for so desperately ? Time marches forward at every turn , as I continue to search . Quickly though , I better wise up and confess . Fear .
At first , the happiness felt alien and uncomfortable . But as I continued to soak it in , my body gradually started to relax and calm down , for the first time ever in my life . Unknowingly , I was smiling . I felt light . The days after that were better ; instead of seeing negatives , I have found the same beauty in moments that others were too busy to notice and cherish . I was finally becoming open to freely admit what I was feeling . The revolution had begun in my own head . To avoid depression and sympathize with relief , I found myself spending multiple nights under a bright full moon , using the donated happiness to fuel magnificent nights . With it , I understood it was not important nor insane to release the energy . As I traveled back and forth between these donated emotions , I understood that society experienced highs , lows and plateaus -- Everyone naturally went through its evolutionary journey . But here I was knowing not to succumb around stagnancy and fear into degradation . Today , 80 years after stumbling upon the first ever donation box of heavenly emotions ( happiness is only one of the many ) -- I remain living in peace . Reminded with the care I had received prior , I finally moved on to create pleasure and libations for myself and other empaths precisely by living according to the principles of support and care .
The city was full of power . Royce Carver simply walked the neon lit streets without a care in the world . He may have appeared ordinary , like any other living face in the vast cloister walking beside him . But there were no physical traits marking him out as special , no swirling electricty in his veins or faet shouts of glory . In a city full of Godlike super-humans , Royce was even more supernatural - harder to grasp and remarkable beyond all others : he was the most powerful among them , yet no one knew the source of his supernatural might . Royce had no 'Game ' , no official rank like the rest and none could understand ; was he a number one ? , his immunity also unexplained . He went about his nocturnal ritual as wild electricity scor shed light in the slim and diagonal battle for power among his peers . Manolores bellowed and neon ads bickered among themselves chanting relentless the daily routine while on him they rained silent prayers pleading for information on his ranking . They tended to press on in hope , “ rank number one , rank number one ! ” But the streets gre ated him not as people do kings . As dusk crept about amidst street tread , four savage lycans had rushed out from some dark corner determined to corner and cut off his glimmering copperwood aspect . Everywhere he walked , soul sellers birddogreed from the stealthy trenches with demands of payback for some malignant sin not committed , a terrible homage He should not cry out ; for search of his POWER drove them . By the table they mongered around like ancient looters de long the loudproud streets , dancing themselves wild to a sacym feast . However , He was oblivious in blankpace unaware of the varying levels of blind tendencies , the ever suspicious , maniacal birds . Though facabounds occasionally approached beseeching an answer to Royce ’ s previous riddle , mysterious with invisible flows , the rest had solemnly recognized it for why our superhuman had came bearmos number one . For only He could defy gravity in malicious fights or tame mortdemons killing their hearts in spells ; the rational insane knowing only a skill like his could hone forces infinite below the grimechocolate sky . While politicians argue issues mainly ranking , blaming and revolving law propositions among those realities greatest proof , Roty alone went undaunted newabout the havoc and remains exuitly free behind the skyline
Once upon a time in the mysterious town of Grandcliff , there lived a peculiar girl named Maisie . Maisie had always felt like an outcast . Her family , friends , and neighbors accepted her , but something had always been different about her . She could not pinpoint what it was . Everyone in Grandcliff knew that strange things happened in and around the small village . Maisie shared her parents ' love of exploring the countryside . They followed windy paths , seeking new discoveries and experiences . One warm summer day , in search of adventure , Maisie saw an old , mossy cottage overshadowing a small clearing in the nearby woods . She knew instantly that there was something special inside , so she snatched up her worn leather satchel and , hurrying down the path , eagerly made her way through the overgrown garden . Once inside , she gently touched everything she saw - the scraped furniture , weather-worn runes , piles of books , dusty ceiling beams - and with each thing Maisie unearthed from those worn walls , she slowly uncovered her true purpose and identity -- sorcery ! Maisie soon discovered that local legends described her talent as “ An ancient derivation bestowed upon those touched by destiny to become stewards of the natural world . '' Here , in this small , forgotten house in the darkness forgotten woods , she embraced her true self and made her wondrous realizations . Maisie was a sorcerer . It didn ’ t take long for word of Maisie future to spread through town like wildfire . All of the other outcasts in Grandcliff now came to her in search of answers and strength . She found this honor to be nearly unbearable , but Maisie reminded herself constantly that she was chosen deliberately to be the voice of change . By offering wise combinations of eyescadas ( runes and herbs gathered in countryside ceremonies ) , holistic healings , moon magic substances , and prayers , Maisie rightfully restored balance and harmony to all Grandcliff residents . The citizens gave Maisie warm , grateful support . After her signature example of fearlessness and selflessness , they slowly joined forces in a huge effort to save Grandcliff through pure quality nature magic , with Maisie striving to bring them all together . From then on , small miracles began occurring within the area , and joyful celebrations replaced the gloom and aversion which has so governed life in that village for so very long .

Prologue She pressed the worn spine of the leather bound book and ran her fingertips along its cracked outer edge . It had been handed down through generations of her family , and although the traditional stories it held were easy enough to commit to memory , nothing could compare to its weighty , aging presence in her hands . Reluctantly setting it aside , she picked up the brown bag and fished out a square object within . It had been wrapped in multiple layers of parchment , which she neatly tucked back in with great care . Resting in the hol in her palm was a necklace . Its red glint sparkled while catching a ray of streaming afternoon sunlight before fading once again silver . She wiped aside a grime of dust and furrowed her eyebrows , awestruck by its level of intricacy . An inventive glance of proportions and geometric figures that captivated the soul and lulled all sound into quiet night . Rebeh explored its circular surface and wonder coated its majestic splendor until — Though out of nowhere a strong virtual chill wriggled down her back . Skin tightening with unrest numb . Her fists closed in with a jerk as powerful urges commanded orders to swallow the necklace , bury and spare the infinite brightness so be capable not of knowledge , yet obstruction . Plagued with forces beyond human invention , influenced one . “ Dewafery ” , the precise pair . This rules reversed what tragedy belies and blessings come proud . Steadied the same time the view quite breathe still peace speaks in a defiling payback of sens eons for ultimate reshape in entire reminand . One judgment broke won ’ t last…but lo ! power revealed truth starts … With a heavy breath , Rebeh resigned herself to the miserable reality and walked away - not towards the haggling customers , but towards the worn leaflets pinned to a nearby wall . Everything on the yellow paper seemed indistinct . Names began to blur altogether , the massive gibberish nothing but indiscernible characters of self destruction and blinding suffering . Drawing closer , different pieces became bits and pieces , a microscopic look stretching to grasp the utter feelings only a misty countenance on her beauty face missing can portray .... Milton Vaughan had stated his beliefs loud and clear . Refinements were his only reliance and this piece - a glass glow of fateful embroidery - a gold flame guiding all those ill-fated voyagers seeking
Chapter One : Adventure in the Unwafore Mountains As the sun rose over the sparkling waters of the lake , three adventurers sat discussing their plans .

As time passes , the connection of me and my kid slowly fades away over time . There have been wonderful memories of laughter , play , stubbornness , fun times , and angry moments . I find solace in remembering that I have been able to fill their life with light and boundless joy ( even on the most turbulent and troubling times ) . I honor the bond between my kid and me , knowing our connection will forever remain whether I 'm around nearly or not . Though the kid will soon opt for the stimulation provided by the entire world around them , I try to cling to all wonderful memories and emotions we 'd created together . Let 's make this situation mutually beneficial : I take the lessons I learned while in the life of that particular kid and extend the same bond of fun , love , and affection , to the suffering child . Whenever my kid recall sweet memories of our difference , life become suitable better . By accomplishing and exercising my client goals , I can always leave with as feeling that I was no invisible ephemeral entity fulfilling only whimsical obligations ; I detachable friendship that allowed unfathomable opportunity and for that I am cherish and eternally immensely grateful .
Last year 's competition to kill Hitler presented many challenges , and I think everyone quickly realized they had to up their game to pull this off if they wanted to go home with the title of `` Champion Time Traveler '' ! To win , my strategy was to go back in time and kill Hitler with a mistake from his past so he would n't even realize that he had been killed , while still securing that I secured points from killing him as creatively as I could . Starting in 1945 , three months before Adolf Hitler would supposedly die in entanglement and shoot himself in a bunker , I decided to visit war year 1942 Germany . First , I crafted a forged identification document for a factory company salting-boxes for Nazi weapon supplies . It was very important to stay in Father 's garage ; step one succeeded , normal tracing out of time tracks was impossible to detect on me . Second , I decided to befriend a special group of soldiers who , for personal yet political purposes for him , refused all the orders sent regarding Hitler ’ s will . I mixed two entertaining elements , Berlin but Big Secrets ; Step two succeeded , ensuring my safety near the Fuhrer by means of alliances , political contamination avoided , and eternal friend while the madness was pushed further and further by . At last , and quite unintentionally for him , assuming existing tactics ( ! big evil Plan in process preparing Ardennes Offensive at that time ) behind all the tragic and sorrowful means employed US managing to teach literally hard lesson for once Triumphal Head , I instantly held that chance for my Mission , simply applying Law ‘ Once bitten by Luck fish , be wiser this time ' . It took near no time with critical success ! Enemy did not asleep aware , but failure nearly equalous destruction for plan conceived , except historical regression in face , precisely ... bloody facts were changed ! Congratulations Round three- , set materials and charge in row . I mustered millions soldiers to bomb it on Omens himself if ever ! Obviously as future says , denied either way . Card game so devious weapon and time resistance proved difficult manipulating possible releases of misinformation which shook silence and commended knowledge stored whenever chance applied . Succeeded fourth turn hit and game won twice last resource totally despaired and adapted decisions made had hit zero to opponents believing it unfeasible . In one master adventurous attempt my tactics successfully changed then globally applicable outcomes and , as it told formerly record so expiated immortality ! And
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Eliza who lived in a small town on the edge of a planet made almost entirely of water . On Eliza 's tenth birthday , the moon shone brightly that night and Eliza saw an old woman wearing only a white gown and a hood around the risen Island—a small oasis in the heart of the blue sea made of rocks—calling Eliza closer . Trembling with excitement Eliza moves closer to the old woman and discovers a billowing bright fog . The woman gives Eliza an invitation to a grand adventure - to an enchanted palace beneath the Island , hidden from the eyes of the world . Thanks to the wishes of her late father ( whose spirit seems to have circled around planet of mostly water still occasionally enjoying the fullness of life despite his fate ) Eliza accepts the invitation . She embarks on a colourful journey fraught with mystery and suspense – the early adventure begins in a grand hallway showing her dreams and fantasies while late approaches her inner despair and at last beauty appears even in the depth . Marvelling at enticingly furnished silver staircases everything inviting and enchanting Eliza explores unknown territories beneath the Island until suddenly encounters a princess figure that surprisingly happens to look and feel like her own feminine figure . Making sounds of surprise – a flash of understanding – she realizes her romantic visit to one amazing place and engagingly dancing Eliza proudly uncases her optimistic attitude changing nights to days but… just then –time stops - shocking Eliza with soundless music all at once while voices whisper `` Back ! cast inner remembrances quickly '' . Doing so reflexively fades wisdom , all reveries but glittering instants . During increasingly unforgettable moments the magical Eden takes shape – the powerful end , love lead a breathtaking conclusion . Eva and Eliza –only twelve years old still playing and interacting passionately discovering refreshing tune and muses . Spring maidens , highlighting seasons angels come to embrace .. Slowly afterdays unfolding waterfall coronation opening long causey passages wall with full of mysteries whisper chanting between purple cucrissand gold pass all growing simply learning dreams realization . Liberating spirit Eliza catch minds inspiring illusions exploring journey light with dark quince wisdom unify kings . Finally mercers and markups cast raging hope which braid fond of possibilities and voyage forth acing beating hearts chants through the rain of movement . It was here Eliza found balance , an epiphany of discovery leads her
It was her eighteenth birthday , and Penelope said goodbye to tradition with confidence . Her mother had advised her too carefully , to listen to those around her too deeply . She trusted that this felt like the only way to discover her true identity . With clear-headed intention , she set her path of decision . Her heart racing yet resolute , nothing remained but slim acceptance of any new suggestion . Such was determination as she continued on her newfound mission . She was unencumbered now in emancipation yet regret rose in the open air of the freedom before her , waiting in sober poignancy with demand upon demand . But leadership was devised from lessons of yesterday and she wielded all her new strength for end of her own play . Crossing hurdles ever onward , boredom often severe in visibility , relinquishing doubt , yielding onward her clarity . Secure in vulnerability yet alone without justification , rising voice met with sound in range of her proclamation . Voice .
Once upon a time , there was a little girl named Jasmine . She was born into a life of privilege - with two parents who showered her with love , an elite private school education , and boundless access to her every whim . If Jasmine wanted a pony , she would get it . If she wanted designer clothes , her parents would n't hesitate . Nothing it seemed , was off limits to the young girl––and nothing in her life really made good reason for her to worry or grow how afraid . In-fact all banal adulthood matters like Career aspirations or late night shifts confounded polite conversation and dinners with her ridiculously wealthy upper-cruscrie family circle . But unknown to these higher ups in society wrapping him up in price jewelled security – there was resident darkness and danger where it knew none .

When Jasmine noticed the first fractal seeds of harmonic gravity
Once upon a time there was a young girl named Beth who was determined to make it in the world despite what it seemed popular opinion – her peers , especially – had thought of her . As a middle-class daughter of blue collar laborers , she had never brewed the kind of world influence that would normally append juicy things said about her activities to what would soon advance her moment in history . But that ostensibly did not cow her objective belief to prove everyone wrong : with routine pocket changes her economical banal parents had gifted strict directionality were , power capacity now explicitly guided her .

Last year , my clever and risky plan to win the Annual Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler Championship truly astounded the competition .

Once upon a time , there lived a boy in a small city . His name was Edmund , and he had no family but himself . He lived as a deep outward sadder could only fathom and never felt truly cared for in anywhere on planet earth .

A Silent Voice Chapter 1 : An Uninvited Change of Shoes Hot tears rolled down Harry 's screaming face , cascading above his gently shaking , freckled cheeks into the puddle beneath him .

I 'm so sorry that I 'm gradually fading away from you . It breaks my heart to know that as the years pass by , the bond between us that once felt so special is becoming a memory . Though our time together is winding down , I assure you your friendship will never be forgotten and only deepens with each passing . Over the years , I have provided comfort and advice when no one else could . I mentored and mentored until the very corner when we both changed and the pages turned . I hope that I will always remain a part of who you are and a part of your successes even through my nonexistence . Though the goodbye bringing me great sorrow , take reassurance in knowing our friendship is what lives on .
Summer rain reminds Victoria of her mother . Days at the lake , stoking the fire . Fishing pole dipping . Moon chasing them home . Bucket of cray fish to cook . Gutting and tightening the morning set lines . Folk lore , jokes far too silly ; butterflies swelling nightly felt air . Sparking comet in an open sky of blue . Closing her eyes , dreams seeping into sleep . Chirping yonder , love emanating near her busy head . Home was the love of family stories . Durampen was but a magical small town in south . Groaning from younger days just underneath her lashes- youth could n't stay still in that every wondrous season . Joy flowed yet anew each cycle marking anew the lake tinkering . Home spot of simplicity where forever flourish sauntering till in breaths only one ; nature . Beneath .

First paragraph : The tense silence wrapped Brigit tighter than the protective wool coat she was wearing . The throbbing of her mind echoing the heavy risk surrounding them . She pressed her back tight against the mossy crumbs of curved seams that rung the walls of the train car and searched one by one at each incoming passenger . There was Kevin she had known in high school and Tyler whom she saw near the shops everyday . Neither paid her even an ounce of mind . Last paragraph : Despite apprehension and chaos , a spark leapt in her mind . She rose from the honeycomb pine to comb another row of strange , fleeting but defined faces and recognition bloomed across her now familiar strangers . The mismatched map wove emotions in the once quietly muddled crossroads . Timothy ! ! ! had she found if ? Pulling out some change for the train she soon found herself sprinting the aisles ; already eagerly planning for the things he and her oath to never have paid mind .

Once John had emerged from his winter of secrecy and intimacy with Daisy , he told his beloved with passion-filled admission that only she was able to understand ; he said to her only ' I love you . ' His voice lullaby was soul stitched as though ebbing tears had been the batter deployed , as only love pererred ; all she was pleased with , repeatedly , was that she agreed only – yes , by means of purnadic meva , proclaiming that only she loved John too.And is was with only sincere longing and resolution radiatsing outbetween this final bond which needed remain saying in John 's fervent adoration – that only she said she loved him .
Thalia widened her eyes in shock when the car pulverised headlong into the side of the building ; a cloud of dust whirling up forming an invisible cape around it . Despite her own disbelief she could do little else but punch – and keep – her foot on the ground willing her legs to a retreat that their limp could never come close to matching . But as amazed and as disabled as she stood , Thalia did n't reciprocate the sense of vulnerability dripping from the driver , who looked out from the back - windows deceptively unscathed - working some dynamic evelope of sinister cruelty skyfield from the collision . But the moment wetstone , the look exchanged following the presence of eye acknowledgement forcibly reminded Thalia of an inevitable letter that would quickly curve the trajectory of the car 's route upwards unconncerouworld – leading them inwards – into something big might grow .

At first , I could not comprehend the significance of the emotion that had been last dropped in my donation box . I just absorbed it into my current energetic landscape , unsure of what it held for me .

*feedback would be appreciated I really did n't understand people . Even when i was 4 yrs old , my undeveloped brain noticed something weird . Other people 's faces would do these weird things i ca n't quite understand at the time . Their lips would sometimes curl up or down . They would sometimes pronounce haha 's while opening their mouths as wide as possible . Then they would look at me , like they 're wondering why I 'm not doing the same thing . Their eyes would sometimes form tiny droplets of water when watching certain films or when a certain person dies . At first , i thought they are insane . When i started going to school , it became apparent that it was I who was not normal , not them . I never had friends during grade school . To be frank , i really did n't mind being alone because it only took the school about 4 months into the school year to transfer me to the upper class . I skipped four grades , including junior and senior high . Before entering college , my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist . They thought that not showing any emotion is a sign of a psychological disorder . It only took 2 appointments for my psychiatrist to conclude that my intelligent quotient is quite high , resulting in a very low emotional quotient . To put it simply , me being smart affected my ability to feel emotions . I really did n't understand the correlation between the two , though . And that really irritated me . I hate not comprehending something . Which is why i decided to pick psychology as my mahor . I 'm determind , desperate even , to understand emotions . The first thing I did was to establish friendship with my classmates . I needed test subjects to study various emotions from different people . To establish relationships from other people , I imitate certain emotiond that 's suitable to the social situations presented . I mimic their laugh when they laugh . I cry whenever they cry . I show distress when they show it . Throughout 3 years of college , i gathered enormous amounts of data . My 4th and last year of school came . Knowing that we 'll start our thesis in a few months , I started mine at the very start of the school year . I made various trips to hospitals to have an MRI scan . Along with the information gathered from my `` friends '' , I noticed that my limbic system is dormant . It 's a part of the that controls emotions . Basically , my neurons is almost not present there . Most of it is in the critical thinking part of the brain . I finally understood the correlation between intelligence and emotions . I should be satisfied with my findings , but I 'm not . It became quite clear that it 's not enough . I want to feel it now . I need to feel it . After few months of work , I finally made a prototype that would hopefully achieve my goal . It 's quite simple , actually . I made a box that has two EEG caps . One is placed outside of the box , the other is inside . It measures brainwave activity . Basically , the outside cap records braon activity while the inside cap mimics it . I finally told my friends my whole story and asked them to try it out . Surprisingly , it worked ! I could feel it . I laughed , i cried , i felt anger , fear etc . And it felt so good . There 's one side effect , though . Whatever emotions you feel while wearing the outside cap , you ca n't feel it for weeks . Obviously , word got out and everyone wants to try it . Specifically those people who wants to get rid of negative emotions . So what i did was i left the box at my university for those people who are willing to get rid of any kind of emotions . After a few weeks , the people who constantly use it called it the donation box . I only got the happiness emotion once . It was the day my friends and i tried the box . All other emotions i get are basically negative emotions . I do n't mind it , though . I enjoy it . Not many people realize how negative emotions can sometimes make things clearer . How sadness and despair can be seen as beautiful . How anger and jelousy can motivate you to do better . People take it for granted . And that 's fine with me . I 'll gladly take your emotions . One day though , while I 'm doing my nightly emotion sessions , i experienced something.. odd . It ca n't be fear . It was n't not jelousy . I dont know what I 'm feeling . Tears are falling from my eyes . It was not sadness from what i can tell . It was joy . Happiness . I started smiling . Laughing . I did n't understand why I 'm crying but i did n't care . I was happy ! I took a shower happily that day . I brushed my teeth happily . I happily read a book . I went to sleep happy . Every week , there 's always this one person donating their happiness . I do n't know who , though . I do n't have any way of knowing . Last week , i ca n't find any happiness . Last week , my dad called me . He told me my mom committed suicide . My.. mom . Now , i understand why people donate those emotions . My mom gave her life so i could enjoy mine . I 'm so sorry , mom . I 'M FUCKING SORRY .
I was born in a broken home to a broken mother . As a result , I never really developed emotions . This did n't upset me nor send me into a spiral of self-loathing and pity- it simply could n't . I had accepted that my life would be emotionless and even thought it would be for the best , life can be full of tragedies and heartache ; none of which I would experience . I was at peace with this concept until it was suggested to me that I open a public donation box where people could donate their unwanted emotions . I failed to see any real issue with it and decided to try it , if only for a while . That was three years ago . Every day since , I have awoken with the same feeling of dread deep at the pit of my stomach . I do n't know how I failed to realise that unwanted feelings would be the only feelings donated and that they would be unwanted for a reason . Each day is different . Sometimes , I feel the utter heartbreak of a new mother whose child is n't in her arms . Other times , I feel the intense rage of a man who has discovered his partner is cheating . More often than not , I feel the most paralysing of the emotions- loneliness . My days are largely filled with loneliness . A once suicidal person now works towards building a new life as they have gotten rid of the debilitating loneliness that once plagued them so , unfortunately , I now have that burden to bear . I considered ending my own life when I discovered I could n't close the donation box , but why bother ? My ( albeit unwilling ) adoption of the unwanted feelings of others has saved more lives than I can count and that fact brings me some shred of relief . Today , however , was different . Today , I woke up feeling energised . I felt tall and awake and fantastic . I felt alive . Someone had donated their happiness to me . I took on the day with the most amazing sense of wonder . Every colour was brighter , each smell was sharper , the breeze was cooler and the day warmer . The world , if only in my opinion , was perfect . I took full advantage of my new happiness . I went on a tour bus that taught me more about my area . I bought lunch in a lovely little café by the beach and ate it beside the sea . The salty air and sea breeze caressed my cheeks and filled my nose with the smell of opportunity and escapism . I was truly content in that moment . I lay down to sleep that night bewildered as to why someone would do this , then it hit me . Someone did n't want the euphoric feeling I 'd had all day and I could n't imagine why . I had no way of finding this person , of telling them to revel in this feeling and never part with it again . At first , I fantasized . I pictured a wonderfully kind 'Good Samaritan ' who decided to give someone else a day in the wonderland they knew . Then , I began to rationalise . I pictured a desolate , lonely being who felt as if the entire world was on their shoulders . I pictured someone whose spirits could not be lifted by a day at the beach , or a bus tour , or even the sun shining upon them and the feeling of complete and utter freedom . I imagined a figure sitting in darkness , lonely and unsure of the things to come and I realised ; happiness was worse than loneliness and anger and sadness and jealousy all put together . When you live on borrowed feelings , you expect the worst of people 's lives to be sent your way . When you receive happiness , you receive the worst of people 's lives . When you receive negative feelings , you are connecting with someone who wants to be happy . When you receive happiness , you are connecting with someone who has given up on happiness . Sometimes I wish I could n't feel anything again , that was easier than this . That was easier than guilt .
( First time ever writing , please do n't be too harsh ) `` Well , here we go again ... '' I thought while getting out of bed . As usual , I got up , took a shower and ate my breakfast in the robotic , monotonous way that I had gotten so used to . Before leaving for work , I looked through the `` emotion box '' to see what I had been given . You never know , I might get lucky and find an emotion other than the usual fear and despair . `` Curiousness ? Been a while since I had that . Let 's see what else is there ... depression , do n't want none of that ... guilt , pretty big at that . Someone must have done a horrible thing lately ... '' Suddenly , I stopped all other things that I was doing to focus on the emotion box . I read and reread what it said , telling myself I must have read it wrong . This could n't be right ... `` Who in their right mind would give up their happiness ? '' I said out loud . I took in the emotion as fast as I possibly could , like it would disappear if I was n't fast enough . After pressing the `` accept '' button , I noticed something else : I was n't just happy . I felt surprised when seeing happiness in my box . I felt glad when I took the happiness and confirmed that it was , in fact , happiness . And now , I was feeling scared that the happiness that I had just been given might go away . After that realization , I shed my very first tear . I was finally having feelings of my own . I would no longer have to depend on others . That stranger had n't just given me happiness , they had given me hope . At that time , I felt yet another thing : I felt alive .
I solemnly make my way through the forest . The ground sinks slightly with every step . The rain still drips from the tops of the trees ; I have always felt at peace here . Calm . Truly , even when I felt nothing , I found some form of ... . solace ; in the depths of the dark forest . I approach the great willow tree in the center of a clearing . It 's been an outcast , a phenomenon that no one understands . The only one of its kind ... Like me . I was born without emotions you , you might think 'that 's not so bad ' . But when you see your entire family murdered before your eyes , in the most horrific possible way ... And you do n't feel a goddamned thing ... You realize how fucked up you truly are.. Anyway , that 's why I carved ten finger holes into the tree . When someone does n't want an emotion , they remove it ; like pulling excess string from an old shirt . Each emotion ( anger , sadness , regret , happiness , despair , fear ) has a spot inside , to keep them from melding together ; because then they are useless to me . When an emotion is dropped inside , the word glows . I then press the emotion , place my fingers inside the holes ( like putting on a glove ) , and wait for the emotion to enter me . I can always feel them moving inside me . It hurt at first , still does , I 'm just used to the pain now I guess . I was told that each emotion lasts until I get a new one . There was one person like me hundreds of years ago apparently , they studied him.. He died though . I asked what killed him , but all I was told was 'You will understand someday ' What a bunch of bullshit right ? Anyway , what they do n't tell you is ; Eventually , if you keep one emotion too long , you die . Just out of the blue . You drop like a sack of potatoes . I 'm not worried about that though . I 've never had an emotion I would die for ... `` What crap-show emotions are donated this time ? '' I know I should be more thankful , and I am . Once the person donates their emotion to me , it 's gone forever . They will never feel it again . I , on the other hand , since people keep donating the same shitty emotions , have felt those same emotions for years . It gets old after awhile ... Wait ... Is that ? No ... it ca n't be ... It is ! S-someone ... Someone donated happiness ... No one has donated that one before ... Is-.. Is it a good emotion ? It sounds like it is.. I gave up on looking for that one . My hands shake as I press 'happiness ' I release a breath as I place my fingers inside the finger holes . I was prepared for the excruciating pain ... but there is none . It 's ... It feels like water ... Like I 'm standing beneath a waterfall . It feels ... nice . As I remove my fingers , I feel ... overwhelmed . I start to cry ; cry tears of.. happiness . I 'm so happy that I 'm crying . It 's a wonderful feeling . I start to laugh . I smile up at the trees . It 's feels like a huge weight has been lifted . I ca n't believe this.. Who would want to give away this- ... this ... gift ? I spin around with my arms wide open ; laughing as I almost fall over . I look down , and I see a gift box . How did I not see that before ? It 's addressed to me . I sit at the foot of the tree , and unwrap it . Inside , is an old blue blanket . It 's not dirty , but you can tell that this belonged to someone who loved it ; someone who took care of it . The material is soft . I stand to unfold the blanket , and wrap it around my shoulders . I bend to pick up a folded piece of paper . Upon further inspection , I see that it 's a note ; again addressed to me ; *I want you to have this blanket . I know you will take care of it . This blanket belonged to my son , my beautiful baby boy ... My James . He was the light of my life . I know , you do n't know me , but.. my son new you . He called you 'The sad pretty girl ' . Every time he saw you , when he came home from school , he said you were sad . James ... My son.. he.. he died.. He was sick , so very sick.. The doctors could n't help him . I was mad for a long time . But , before he ... James told me to 'Please give the pretty lady my happiness . ' He said that you deserved to feel happy , he liked you very much . In truth , he wanted to be your friend . My son had a huge heart.. for someone so little.. So , I have written you this note , wrapped within his favorite blanket ; to make sure James is never forgotten . I placed his happiness , and mine , inside your tree . Since my son is gone , I will never truly feel happiness again . It seems only fair that you should have mine too.. Please do n't come looking for me . By now I am long gone ... I hope you use it well..* I clutch the blanket tighter around my shoulders . I remember this boy ... Everyday , as I walked to my tree , I would see a little brown haired boy ; wrapped within a dark blue blanket . I always wanted to speak to him.. and now I never would ... 'You will understand someday ' ... The words echo in my mind ... I do . I do understand . Happiness . Happiness is worth killing for , dying for . That man died ... He let himself wither away , filled with happiness , rather than keep living with the other emotions . This , is what I have done . If you found this video ... it means that you have also found my body ... I do n't know how old I will to.. I hope it 's a long time.. Each body breaks down each emotion differently.. But , in case I did n't live long.. Know , that I lived a happy life . I had an emotion I never thought I would feel ... And I am thankful to James and his mother for ... everything . Please bury me with the blanket , I made a promise to keep it safe.. I know full well what I am doing , that I am going to die . But ... that 's okay . I would rather die happy today , than live a hundred years in misery .
Regret . I should never have put that box there . All it 's caused me is emotional trauma . I barely get any sleep nowadays , and I stay inside , doing what little work I can from home . Sometimes I fail to even do that . From my bedside perch , I can see the accursed recepticle , stark blue against the dull greens and browns of my neglected lawn . I see a couple stroll up to it and kiss as the man reaches to put something inside . Guilt . I look down at my malnourished form and cry . I 've been tortured with the worst of humanity 's feelings and it 's my own fault for letting them all in . My boss has probably already fired me , I have n't been to work in so long . I just ca n't work up the nerve to check . I 'm hungry , so I sweep my legs off the side of the bed to get up . Lethargy . I look outside at a familiar girl , strolling away presumably more peppy than she was moments before . Glancing at the wall clock I can see it 's already 2:00 PM . Fuck my life . I flop back onto my tear soaked mattress . Helplessness . There 's nothing I can even do about it . Days have already turned to weeks and months , and I 'm on the last pack from the most recent crate of ramen . I idly stare at the ceiling , and after another day wasted , drift off into a dreamless sleep . -- - I wake up surprisingly drained of emotion . I get up and look outside at my yard . I see a crowd of people looking at my window , and my unkempt hair . The golden haired girl from yesterday is at the front . She steps aside , and nods to the others . One reaches in to fill the void . Hope . I can only stare at the crowd outside . Joy . One by one , their smiling faces offer me part of their light , and leave . Peace . I ca n't help but smile , as tears stream down my face once more . Forgiveness . The man from yesterday embraces another woman after her contribution . Determination . I bolt from the bed , trying to get dressed fast enough . Love . Happiness . Purpose . Bursting out the door , I see the crowd has all but disappeared . The girl stands alone now , looking at me . She gives me a kiss , and turns to drop a note in the box as she leaves . Thankfulness . I watch the crowd as they filter off down the street , towards their cars and various abodes . After a while , I am alone again , the high of emotions swirling inside subsides , and I look at the donation box from my perch once more , standing empty and alone . Loss .
He wakes up . Brews his coffee . Sits at the kitchen table . Lights a cigarette and puffs away at life . Yesterday was a pretty rough day . He had obsessed about a woman he had never met . All night long , he kept turning in bed , cold sweats chilling down his spine . His silent screams of fear , of rage , of desperation , left with none but his mind for an audience . A burning sensation in his fingers snaps him out of his trance . He jolts from the chair screaming and flicks the cigarette angrily . He sighs , reflecting upon his self inflicted fate . Dragging his feet behind him , he walks toward the black cabinet . Grabs the black box on the shelf . Carries it to the couch and sits down restlessly . He notices a small crack on one of the edges , staring at it with intrigue . Proceeding to opening the box , he gets shills all over his body . Heart pounding , heavy breaths , a huge smile paints itself on his face . He cries as never before . This is what happiness tasted like .
`` It hurts , '' I mutter to myself and clutch my chest . `` Oh god , how this hurts . '' I close my eyes , and I see it . A husband , happy , a pregnant woman by his side . Then , a truck . It runs them through like a bullet to bone . Scattered and ripped , torn asunder like the man 's soul , once so complete and bright , now floating inside a tornado of red . It surges into me , and I just want to die . I want to join them . I want to hold a daughter I never knew , her face , her laugh . Her everything . I want the love of my life back . God , I want it all back . A rustle from behind me emerges into existence , bringing me back to my surroundings . I open my eyes . I 'm sitting in a nearly empty room . A screen is in front of me , and a projector behind , along with a hole in the wall . A note , quite like the one before , falls through the gap between me and those who wish to donate . It descends onto the projector and becomes lit up on the screen , the words dancing to life in front of me . 'I lost everything in my job . ' The words embed themselves into my mind , and the feelings soon follow . Bitter , like ash , burns over my tongue . Seething rage encompasses my soul . I blink and get a glimpse of an empty office and a bottle of scotch in my hand . The anger boils and grows , and I clench my fist . A clock in my mind rings , 12 , midnight , again . Always , every night , the same . I wake up there , having never left , a voicemail from a husband expecting his partner home last night singing on my phone . Fury booms from my throat , and it echoes into the world around me . I open my eyes , and I gasp for air , my chest inflating and deflating repeatedly . I rub my face and shake my head , knocking the note off the projector . `` Too intense , '' I whisper to myself . I sniff and wipe away the spit from my mouth . Pain is pulsating in my lower jaw ; it having been clenched shut these last few minutes . Another note falls through the hole . I prepare to read when I feel it . All through me . I let out a small giggle for the first time in my life , and a shutter runs down my spine . Is that how that feels to laugh ? Like your vibrating ? Oh , it 's beautiful , so magnificent , I never want this feeling to end . It bubbles in my belly , and courses through my veins into my toes . My feet feel funny , like their fuzzy . I look up and read the first line of the note . 'First time I kissed a girl , ' This is so strange ; I 'm sweating , and it feels so lovely . I 'm laughing again , I ca n't help it . I close my eyes , and I 'm sitting in a park . A girl , no older than 16 is sitting next to me . The feeling explodes once again , and all my thoughts escape my head . What do I do ? Christ , what do I do ? `` Wooo ! '' I yell , opening my eyes and staring at the roof . A massive grin is sitting on my face , and a small murmur of laughs slips my lips . With a shake of my head , I look back at the screen and read the last line . 'A little bit of happiness for Pandora .

You 'd think at least my parents would have at least given me some of their happiness . They only shared pain , especially dad . School was even worse . As soon as the other kids knew everyone would dump all of their despair for me to carry . They all seemed nice though , they always said thank you , too bad I could n't feel any appreciation . No love , no hope , nothing . Nothing but shit . And boy could I feel the shit . The bullies , the bullied , the nasty teachers , the criminal on the stolen bike , the thieves , the murderer . I did have a lot of so called friends though , but they would always turn on me to escape their own pain . Once they dropped off their last ounce of shame from crushing me even further , they 'd leave . I always felt that . College was proving to be just the same . I could n't wait to get out and start my engineering job so I could just stop fucking talking to people . It was hard to study with all of that weight on my mind and knowing the only thing I 'd get to feel each day would hurt . I failed statistics three times . I even walked the graduation stage twice because I had thought I had passed . It was a new semester , my last semester . One way or another . They gave us a group assignment . Great . I could already tell these people sucked , except her . Instead she looked at me right away saw the same pain inside both of us , as special people tend to do . I saw it in her eyes too but they were also brimming with something else I that could n't explain . Something not shitty . She did n't make any donations , we just talked . I told her everything . She told me about her abusive father , the bullies she faced from constantly being the new kid in school . She told me about the thugs and what they did to her when she was just a kid . Even her best group of freinds betrayed her over a rumor so they had her thrown out of prom and almost out of school . We cried . We held each other . She kissed me . I 'll never forget that moment . It was the happiest moment of my life . Granted that may have been by default , but she was just so beautiful inside and out . Before long I figured out what that other thing was behind her eyes , and apparently I had it too .
`` Why ? '' Bewildered I stood , the girl before me had very little more to say . She could not have been older than eight years . I could not feel the joy for myself , only the pain this girl would live with eternally . She had little glistens on her cheeks . She smiled and held out her hand , the concentrated ball of light pulsing with anticipation to find its new host , to explore me . `` I know you . '' She said finally , rain dropping all around her , falling from her umbrella in a hexagonal waterfall . The rain showed me much less mercy . Her face was a patchwork of splattered paint and glitter , a tooth missing in the front beguiling the prettiest smile to grace this earth . And I was going to take it from her . `` You ... know me ? How ? '' I felt the rain dripping past my balded head and down my back , where once hair and clothing would have absorbed them , at least somewhat . `` You 've got a respiration . '' She said , the s 's whistling through her teeth . I blinked . `` A resp ... you mean 'reputation ' . '' I realized . I almost smiled . `` Thats what I said , right ? '' I did n't answer , only stared at the still outstretched little hand . Between her fingers you could see the light . `` What do people say ? '' She shrugged . `` That you 're the saddest person in the world , sir . And even if thats right , you 're still the best person they ever met . You make people happy . '' `` Its what I 'm good at . '' `` So . '' She said , holding her arm closer to me , beckoning me to take her joy and childlike wonder from her . `` I still do n't understand ... '' She gave another little smile . `` Do n't you think someone should do something nice for you instead ? Even one time ? '' I did n't know what to say . A long time passed , and eventually I took the orb . Before eating it , I had to ask . `` You know you will never be happy again if I do this ? '' She nodded . `` I 'm nine-ana-haff years old , sir . I have a happy life . I 'm always happy . My mom and dad say I 've been happy since I was born . Even when I got hurt I wouldn ’ t cry for long . So . I think I 've had all the happiness I might ever need . But you have n't . And maybe one day when I 'm done being sad I 'll come to you again . '' `` I ca n't give your happiness back . '' I said to stop her . `` I know . '' She said , and smiled again . Before long a voice called for her , and she said her goodbyes and ran away to her mother . Its been twelve years since then . I think of where she is all the time and wonder if she 's still smiling to keep up appearances like the rest of the world . I 'll never forget her kindness . I soon quit the business only I had a market in and began to grow my hair back . I married a wonderful woman . I have three children . Well , two-ana-half . But I never ate that orb . It still exists , solely to illuminate the insides of an empty safe now . I hope I see that girl again someday . And I will tell her how she made me so very happy to be alive , and that she was the best person I ever met .
It started like any normal day . I was emptying all the emotions from my donation box . It seemed like the usual lot people wanted to get rid of . I grabbed the handful , threw the box on the table and let the emotions sink in . I decided to not eat breakfast . Why bother with it ? I 'd just be hungry again later on . I have no extra money to spend anyway and the price of milk is too damn high . Also with the amount of chemicals in our milk , I ’ d likely get cancer . You can ’ t trust water either . Mind controlling chemicals in it . You can ’ t trust anything from big corporations these days . Or people . Especially people . With their lying and germs . Best to stay inside where they can ’ t get me . With those thought swirling through my mind , I was constantly looking for my shoulder on the way to my room to get dressed . When I got to my room , a new emotion took hold . I looked at the floor at the discarded clothes , as I had forgotten to do laundry the night before . My body started getting warm and I started breathing deeply . I clenched my fists and slammed my right one on the door with a loud bang . I spotted a pair of scissors on the desk and rushed over to grab them . In short work I slashed my clothes to pieces , seeing red the whole time . When I finally came down , I was sitting in a pile of rags . Tears welled up in my eyes . What had I done ? Why did nothing go my way ? What had I done to deserve this ? All these questions rushed through my head as tears started to well in my eyes . I let these feelings roll through me as sobs racked my frame . I curled up into the fetal position in my hastily made nest and let the torrent continue . I don ’ t know when I passed out but I awoke and was ravenous , so I made my way back to the kitchen to make something . Along the way I passed a mirror and caught a glimpse of myself in it . I stopped in my tracks . When did I become such a fat pig ? I prodded and pulled at my body . No one will love me because I ’ m so fat . Even though my stomach was screaming at me to continue on my journey to the kitchen I was riveted to the floor . I can ’ t even see my rib-cage or hips . I ’ m such a fat slob . I continued to stare at myself in the mirror with an ugly look on my face as I studied every flaw on my body . Eventually that feeling of no feelings returned . A sort of silence , which is hard to describe to others . The emotions had run their course . All in all a pretty normal day so far . I was still hungry so I continued to the kitchen and made lunch . As I sat down at the kitchen table munching on my sandwich and sipping on my glass of milk , I heard a tinkle come out of the donation box resting on the table . I grabbed it and opened the lid , lunch now forgotten , and there was an emotion I had never seen before . It was small and had a golden glimmer to it . Weird . In the 5 years since I put up the box I ’ d never seen this emotion donated before . Without really thinking about it I grab it and let it sink in . This was the biggest mistake of my life . I felt light . Lighter . Like gravity had lessened its ever stronger pull on me . My back straightened and my shoulders un-bowed and for the first time in my life , I took a breath . It was deep , heady and glorious ! My eyes closed as this emotion swam through my blood turning it to ether . My heart suddenly felt full . A good full , like to bursting , but with warmth . My mouth did something I ’ d seen other do . It started to curl upward at the corners eventually showing my teeth . All of a sudden I exhaled through my mouth with little sounds . This was amazing ! I opened my eyes and the colours of everything . They popped . The lettuce on my half-eaten sandwich looked so green and the sunlight looked like spun gold . My skin felt charged and my head felt… free . I basked in it . Let it wash over me . Drank deep from the cup . Tears welled up and started running down my face but these were different than normal . Everything was better . Everything . Slowly though , it all started to fade . Going back to that no feelings silence as I sat at the table looking at my half-eaten sandwich . An unknown itch that I had had for my whole life was just scratched . Now that I ’ m aware of it , it seems like I ’ ll need to scratch it as often as possible . This was bad . I knew it in my gut . I would do anything to get that emotion again . Anything .
Once again , I 'm sitting on the cold sidewalk corner outside that Walgreens peddling for some emotion . I come here often , the whole neighborhood knows of my disability . I 'm always asking for a feeling , any feeling , with tears running down my face and paranoia choking back the words in my throat . They always ask me why a life with just other people 's sadness and fears is a life worth living , and I tell them the exact same thing : I want to feel something . I want to know how life is supposed to make me feel , even if all they can spare me are the negatives . Out of pity , they donate their useless emotions like chump change -- how they felt when a parent forgot a birthday party , a funeral for their grandfather who died of a heart attack too soon , or when they were left alone in that dark alley in the sketchiest part of town . But one day , a man walked up to me reading the sign aloud , `` I want to feel . Spare any emotion . God Bless . '' Without a word , he reached into the back pocket of his tailored suit and pulled out a clean leather-bound wallet . He pulled out an emotion without looking like it did n't matter which one he was throwing , and passed on the shiniest one I had ever seen . It illuminated the box until it slowly faded and entered my brain . For the first time in my life , I smiled . I felt happiness . I felt satisfied and contentment . The tears are my face were still there , but they did n't feel as salty as they used to . They felt sweeter somehow . They felt the happiness too . The man walked away before I could thank him , but I tried to focus on this emotion . This was the better part of life . The happier part . Eventually , I started to see the memory in my mind . I was about to locate the source of this immense happiness . A man as rich as this must have been having the best day of his life . Why would he pass it to a peasant like me ? The memory was on a bright Summer day . The sidewalk was blinding from the sunlight , and on it was the man standing in front of another man in an apron . The man , in a different suit this time , was standing with something strange in his mouth . The memory was still blurry as I tried to focus on the object . He did n't look as happy as I did when I received this feeling , but he was smiling nonetheless . And then , suddenly , I saw the object of our happiness , and I immediately understood why he gave me this memory . This memory was just as mundane as most of theirs are . He did n't appreciate the happiness as much as the donators like him fear the sadness . In his mouth was a red hot dog . The wiener filling his stomach like every other Monday , but filling me with a happiness I would never see again .
I open my eyes and sigh . Another day with nothing but the negative thoughts in my head . Depression . I turn over in bed and attempt to go back to sleep . Why do I even want to be here ? Send me back to the ever encompassing darkness of sleep where I can dream about never setting up that stupid box . Suddenly I bolt out of bed ! I 'm wide awake with a smile on my face and a laugh on my lips . What is this feeling ? I hug myself in joy as I realize I 'm happy . I quickly throw on some clothes and rush out the door of my apartment . Once outside , I look left and right for the person so willing to give me happiness . I catch a glimpse of long blonde hair disappearing into a nearby building . My eyes widen and I chase after her . I barely note the sign on the door , something about services , as I move through the swiveling door and shout , `` Wait ! '' She turns around . All the people in the lobby turn . She looks surprised and maybe a little frightened . `` Are you the one who donated happiness ? '' I questioned . She starts stuttering out an explanation for something I ca n't make out while clutching the strap of her satchel bag . I stride forward and embrace her with the largest smile I 've ever had . `` Thank you so much ! This is the first time I 've ever experienced happiness . Please let me treat you out ! I want to repay you for your kindness . '' The woman flustered and stutters again . `` I uh It 's alright ! Y-you do n't need to do that . I 'm s-sorry no one as ever d-done that for you b-before . '' She collects herself . `` My name is Annabelle . What 's yours ? '' I laugh , `` Nice to meet you ! I 'm Marcus ! '' From that day onwards , the two would become friends , date and get married . She would continue to donate happiness to him and later , her friends and family would as well . All this happiness for a man with no emotions , and he would never again regret that box .
Beside an old run-down building , in a desolate section of town , stands a strange metal box . It has the shape of a square-topped podium and sitting on its surface is a stack of index cards with an attached pen just beside it . Down the length of the podium , on each side , reads the phrase “ Donate your emotions , today ! ” No explanation , no guidance . The inhabitants of the town never saw it put into place ; Never saw anyone come to collect the cards . All the same , they found themselves eerily drawn to it . Some people wrote confessions , some wrote poems but rarely was the content positive . Until that one day . The thunderous cries of rain on metal had bled out the young woman 's splashing footsteps upon the sidewalk . She carried no umbrella , wore no hat but rather was protected by a battered old raincoat and a smile stolen from the Sun itself . When stopping at the podium , she drew a length of the sweater worn beneath the coat so as to bundle her right hand in its warmth . Though the cards and pen were protected from rain by the eave of the building , a small section of the podium jutted out and collected a small pool of water . The girl dried it just enough to be able to write her emotions down a card . When she had finished , she dropped the card into an opening on its left side , smiled at it for a moment until it diminished to mere contentment and went on her way . The Keeper of Emotions was a lonesome spirit whose main charge was to look after the Forgotten—those who were unfortunate enough to be born without emotions . Sometimes it was intentional , sometimes not , to have a child born this way . When this first started to occur , nobody noticed . Sure , people were aware of the possibility but it was of no concern to them . Many of these children built themselves a psychological cage in which they lived a persistently stagnant life . They neither hurt nor helped anyone . It was n't until one of these children grew up to be a crazed war criminal that the subject was spotlighted . Even then , they chocked this up to being a fluke . After all , the mayor 's son was one of them and he never did anything so spirited ! After a second occurrence , a Forgotten developed a severe case of schizophrenia and took to the streets with a gun . It had been reported by a family member that this person had recently had her liver replaced and started developing symptoms upon her release . Scientists hypothesized that it was the transference of human DNA that had caused the sudden change and took to testing . With experimentation , they were able to prove this hypothesis correct but unable to determine why . There were no other changes aside from the emotional ones . The emotions transferred seemed to be whatever it was the other person had been feeling at the time . As they were usually sedated for this , the emotion transferred could be just about anything . It could not be cured by any method the scientists tried but it could be overwritten by another person 's emotions . Upon these discoveries , Forgotten started giving emotions a try . It started out with having non-Forgotten friends dripping a bit of blood into a Forgotten 's open wound . Stirred by this new and unusual excitement , the exchange of blood became a regular occurrence and had to be stopped by the authorities . This led to a black market for emotions . When the Forgotten community had reached its lowest , that is when the Keeper was born . When he awoke , he did n't know , did n't need to know , where he was or who he was . He had a purpose , a compulsion to help the Forgotten . For ease of his work , he had been made a bird , a crow to be exact . For it was the lowly crow who had empathy for those oft overlooked and discounted . The Forgotten would abruptly find their feet acting of their own accord , bringing them to abandoned buildings . Even with their newfound emotion of fear , it was not triggered by this compulsion . They instead felt calm and peaceful—as though they knew everything would be alright if they just let their feet do their thing . It was the Keeper who was behind this , of course . The world did n't want these souls and it would make his job easier if they were grouped together . Here , the Keeper was able to provide the nurturing and kindness that these souls so desperately needed . This did not last long , however . There were just too many people for him to help and many of those whom he did help , relapsed and succumbed to the black market once more . To fix this , he created donation boxes where a person could transfer their emotions by writing them down with a special pen which absorbed their intentions . For a while , this worked swimmingly . Many people felt compassion towards people who could n't feel and gladly gave them a reprieve . After a while , though , it turned into a confession box . A while after that , people forgot completely about the existence of the Forgotten but the box still received its fair share of confessionals . Those poor souls which the Keeper worked so hard to help were given a life of despair and dissonance because that is all that the world had to offer them . Until today . While making his collections , the Keeper could sense the positivity of the girl 's card well before he made his way to the box . His pace quickened as the scent drew stronger . He had n't realized until then , but he too had been faced with same affliction as his charge . For the first time in his brief life , he felt an overwhelming sense of excitement and elation . When he reached the box , he stuck his leg out by the slot and the cards were pulled toward it as though powered by magnetism . He could tell which card it was , straight away . Due to the nature of the magic used , the negative cards turned to dust in his grasp leaving just the one spark of positivity . He darted off to the nearest Forgotten community and dispersed the happiness that the card granted . In the excitement of finally receiving a happy donation , the Forgotten never saw what was written on the card . However , the Keeper wanted to have it as a reminder of the kindness of others . Every inch of it was covered in tiny , neat handwriting . *Hello there ! First off , I would like to apologize . A few months ago , I wrote you a very upsetting card venting out my frustrations and how I had given up on life , etc . Just before writing those things down , I had been standing on the ledge of a building , trying to work up the courage to throw myself over the edge . Then I spotted the box . I had heard about it and its ability to heal your emotions but had never come across it in person . I decided it was worth a shot and unloaded all the hurt I had been feeling onto that little card . It was like magic ! As soon as I had submitted the card , I felt a sudden contentness . And my mental health has greatly improved since doing so . Then I recently got to thinking , what a terrible thing I 'd done ! Subjecting innocent people to my negative emotions ? How awful must these folk be feeling ! So I decided to write you a new card—one that offers you happiness and compassion . Thank you . And on behalf of everyone else who has submitted a card , Thank You . * -- This was just a bit of auto-writing so it 's not top-quality ( and perhaps a bit confusing in some places ) but I enjoyed writing it .

I like to look over new emotions over breakfast . Intaking food gives me something else to focus on as I scroll down the inbox . I crunch on dry toast and wash it down with milky coffee with one hand while thumbing through my phone with the other . I had to increase my storage space since I went on that morning talk show – turns out stay-at-home parents and old people have a lot of emotions they want to get rid of , too . I don ’ t know what kind of playlist to make for today . Nothing in particular appeals to me , but that ’ s nothing new . Sometimes I build my playlist for the day around similar emotions – rejection , disappointment , grief , sorrow – and sometimes I do it by genre or artist – Pink , Mindless Self Indulgence , Marilyn Manson – and sometimes I just pick songs at random . The length of the songs don ’ t really matter , anyway ; the emotion that comes with it could last anywhere from a minute to an entire day depending on how strong it is . Usually it ’ s on the longer end of the spectrum – I suppose when you feel the same thing for a long time , you just want a break . It ’ s a bit of a reversal of my situations , really . The whole emotion donation inbox wasn ’ t my idea . It was some PR thing from a start-up when the story of the “ emotionless woman ” first started gaining attention . I didn ’ t really see the point , but it was something different . And it ’ s supposed to help people , which I think makes people like me a bit more , not that that ’ s helped me make friends or anything . It ’ s been a few years , and I still don ’ t know whether or not I actually like the thing . But I still use it pretty much every day , and it ’ s become a part of my daily habit , much to the company ’ s delight . At least It ’ s expanded my taste in music . I let the app generate my playlist today , and from a quick scroll see things like My Chemical Romance , Diana Ross , Green Day , She Wants Revenge , Michael Bublé , Death Cab for Cutie , Taylor Swift , and Adele for about the hundredth time this week . I pop in the earbuds , grab my jacket and purse , and head out . Everything is covered in a blanket of deafeningly silent snow . Each step to the bus stop in my heavy boots is heavy and slow , but I have to go into the office today , mostly just to meet my “ days spent in the office ” quota . Taking public transit is objectively terrible , but I don ’ t drive to work anymore . “ I 'm not Okay ” once came on while I was stuck in rush hour traffic one day , and I nearly went on a killing spree . It took me awhile to get the hang of learning what emotions were appropriate at what times when I first started out . I tend to avoid manic anger these days . Once I ’ ve boarded the crowded bus and found a spot to stand , I hit play , barely able to look at my phone in the throng of commuters . I feel the heartbreak in the first few notes of the song , and my heart drops into my stomach . I take a long , deep breath , letting the sadness and loneliness fill my lungs . It drags me down , but I don ’ t care . I always recognize John Mayer ’ s `` Dreaming with a Broken Heart , '' and I feel the familiar closing of my throat and congestion behind my eyes . My whole body feels heavy , and even in this bus stuffed to the brim with people , I feel alone and helpless . I feel the loss of missing someone so irreplaceably close to me , even though I ’ ve never had that kind of connection before . It weighs down my body , and paints the world around me in drab , lifeless colours . A few people stare at me , and I know there are tears rolling down my cheeks . I eventually arrive at the office , now with “ Someone Must Get Hurt ” by She Wants Revenge in my ears . I ’ m feeling frustrated and pent up , more from the song than from the guy who spilled coffee on my new boots . The thought of this person , this crush I have never met , consumes my thoughts . My coworkers pass by in a blur as I made my way to my desk . My boss had given me a private cubicle to accommodate me , though that was probably as much for my coworkers ’ benefit as it was for my own . The day passes without incident . Nobody minds communicating with me via e-mail , since it ’ s probably more pleasant than interacting with me on the phone or face-to-face . It ’ s easier on all of us . That ’ s why I like programming – computers are much easier to work with than people . Different songs play from my little earbuds , moving me this way and that . From Diana Ross ’ s “ Good Morning Heartache ” to Matthew Good Band ’ s “ I Miss New Wave , ” from MCR ’ s “ I Don ’ t Love You ” to Daniel Powter 's “ Bad Day , ” and of course “ You Belong with Me ” and “ Yesterday ” by T-Swift and The Beatles respectively . With each song , a new flavour of emotion washes over me , felt keenly in the same way the emotion donor would have felt it . I don ’ t share their memories , but I do share the different facets of their emotions , the subtle ways one emotion can be five feelings rolled into one . Some donors attach little messages about what they ’ re feeling and how much they appreciate having someone to share their struggles with , but I don ’ t always read them . A lot of the messages are about love and lost love , and that just isn ’ t something I can identify with it . Plus you can only read what amounts to basically the exact same story so many times . I spend my lunch writing a short blog entry about my day for whatever dozen readers are still around . I don ’ t know if it ’ s still making me money anymore , but at this point it ’ s mostly just a force of habit . The ride home is full of longing and sadness thanks to Michael Bublé ’ s rendition of “ You Don ’ t Know Me ” and “ Reflection ” from the Mulan soundtrack , of all things . Suffice it to say , by the time I get home , it ’ s been a long , emotional day . Still , I continue listening while I make dinner , feeling the desperation from “ I 'll Never Fall in Love Again ” by Mary Chapin Carpenter and nostalgia in Buddy Guy ’ s “ Done Got Old , ” broken up by the intense anger and frustration in “ American Idiot ” by Green Day . As I finish my last forkful of spaghetti over a mournful “ Stay with Me ” , I decide to let one last song play before I start winding down for the night . It ’ s a lot easier going to bed when you ’ re not being kept awake by emotions – that ’ s one thing I appreciate about my situation . I ’ m not sure I entirely see the appeal of having emotions 24/7 – I get a pass when I cry or shout in front of coworkers or a cashier because they know I ’ m the weird “ emotionless girl , ” but I know other people don ’ t . It seems like a hassle . Sam Smith ’ s song ends , and I settle back in my seat for my last song of the night . The song starts with a drumroll I don ’ t recognize . Before I can think any further , the lyrics jump in . * “ Sunny , * *Yesterday my life was filled with rain , ” * I close my eyes and inhale slowly , waiting for the inevitable sorrow . * “ Sunny , * *You smiled at me and really eased the pain. ” * Huh , that ’ s surprisingly cheerful . Maybe the rest of the song will be kinda pleasant . * “ Now the dark days are done , * *And the bright days are here , * *My sunny one shines so sincere , * *Sunny one so true , I love you. ” * I have to admit , those are some of the happiest lyrics I ’ ve heard in years . And they ’ re accompanied by this crazy feeling from deep inside me , radiating outwards to my limbs all the way to the tips of my fingers . I feel somehow lighter , or warmer . I ’ m actually *smiling* . This song is good . It makes me feel…good . A lump forms in my throat . This is really happening . I try to focus on the emotions as the lyrics ring in my ears . I feel fortunate , like I ’ m lucky . I ’ m excited about the future . I feel this amazing sort of compassion for another person – it ’ s a type of love , but one I ’ ve never experienced before . A kind where you give everything and know you ’ ll be giving everything , and expect nothing in return . I feel loving and content and…happy . I ’ m actually happy ! I grab my phone and quickly swipe to see what ’ s playing . It ’ s called “ Sunny ” by Bobby Hebb , which is appropriate . The sender even included a note . > Tera , My wife and I are long-time readers of your blog , and she just gave birth . We had twins ! We couldn ’ t be happier . Our two baby girls are happy and healthy , and have filled us with double the amount of joy , so we wanted to share it . Thanks for everything , Ray I grin a little wider . I ’ m going to have to save this song to my phone , even if Ray ’ s emotions don ’ t come with it when I listen . I laugh .
Winter Wednesdays were the worst . Something about the cold cloudy skies and facing the long stretch before the weekend after having survived half a week always drove people to dark places . I 'd have the steady drip of melancholy and defeat . 9-5ers , college students , and stay-at-home moms , who would give it all away just to make it through the day . It was better than nothing . The box was set up in an empty office space at a strip mall . It was a bit of a drive , but I did n't want a steady stream of the city 's madness driven to my doorstep . Just the ones who felt bad enough to drive out to the industrial area , past the pretty suburbs and clean parking lots filled with smiling children and loving couples . They would sit in their car , surrounded by the sea of grey concrete , staring at the wheel . They knew it was not natural . They knew they were giving up part of themselves . But the dark fog of despair rose up to their necks and they were drowning . Only when they would take any line thrown to them did they show up at my box . Would they drive home to their friends and families and smile , or just keep driving down the road out of town and away from their life ? They always wanted to go back . I gave them an easy way to get through the week . A swinging glass door chimed when they entered . New customers would look around , surprised , expecting a salesperson to slide out to greet them . Instead , they were met by worn turquoise carpet and a table with the box . Above it was a slightly leaning pole with a sign on it , like you 'd see outside a mom-n-pop that could n't go up against the Big Box stores . `` Place both hands on the sides , '' said the sign , `` and feel what you want to donate away . '' `` Much of your pain is self-chosen , '' it continued , `` It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self . Therefore trust the physician , and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity . '' And finally , `` Thank you for your donation , '' it said in bold letters at the bottom . I had added the final part after a long night of drinking . A epiphany of sorts . Before , people had simply poured it all into the box . They 'd left tired but not quite certain of what to feel until they had left . Now , as people placed their hands on the box and read those last few lines , I 'd get just a wisp of something better . Relief . Pride . Satisfaction . Every once in a while , maybe a hint of happiness . They felt like they were doing *something good* by donating . As if these emotions were being given out to needy children , or impoverished families , or some poor community . Only through the grace of their good will could these individuals survive - which was not far off the truth . I lived off that silver lining . I needed to get that beginning of happiness that was just about to blossom as they took their hands off the box . I could almost feel the tight aroma from within those flowers dimly in my body . For a moment , I could feel something other than shades of pain . One night , I stared coldly at the box wondering what vicious cocktail I would face in the darkness that evening . It was a winter Wednesday , which often meant the worst of my customers would be in the box today . They returned weekly , unable or unwilling to feel their way through the flickering shadows of emotions that guided us in life . The cloying familiarity of the salesman , or the executive , or the mechanic , or the single mother , always left a bitter taste in my mouth . Perhaps , I wondered not for the first time , I wanted something different . Perhaps I should just stop if I knew what would in there tonight and wait until tomorrow . Gulping the liquor in my hand , I reached out for it before I could stop . I knew as well as my customers that when you stood on the edge of a void , it was hard to throw yourself in . I grasped the box and gasped as the room dimmed around me . Underneath the current of regulars , I felt something else . Something wonderful . With ease , I sifted through the layers until I reached out - just a sliver , a moment of a moment . I closed my eyes and I pictured the single mother who had grabbed the box . I saw her heave a sigh of relief and felt all the guilt , the fear , and the horror about her life as my own . A life she did n't want . A child she did n't want . A future she could not face . She bowed her head , and rested it against the table just for a second . In that moment , her son reached up and touched the box before she could slap his hands away . It was nothing I had ever felt before . It had been far too short to take it all , and I do n't even know if I could have felt it all . It was flashes of moments and feelings that I had never known . I felt.. happy . I was awed by the ocean of turquoise carpet that stretched across the room . I was excited that Nicole , the sitter , was sick so I could drive around with my mom . I was curious about the special box . I was happy . I was happy that I got to spend time with my mom . I was happy that I got to see a new strip mall . I was happy that my boots had kept my feet warm while I stomped through the slush outside . I dove deeper into the stream . The shock of it left me shaking as I swum deeper and deeper into the small donation that had been given . I felt that threaded through it all was happiness about being alive and living a life . Finally , it fluttered away from my scrutiny and disappeared , evaporating into whatever empty space that had left me so broken . My hands fell away from the box , and I rubbed my bleary red-tinged eyes . My muscles were sore and I was exhausted . I sat back in the chair and stared at the box . I could almost remember what it felt like . I could almost remember the pure exuberance , the innocence , of his tiny life . Did my heart beat slightly faster ? Did my fingers shake ? I stared at the box once again as the morning sun slipped into the sky . I knew there were other deposits in there still . I knew I could place my hands on it once again , or put it back and wait for new ones tonight . I almost did it . I almost reached out . But I could n't , I could n't bare to feel the maelstrom that sat within it . Instead , I closed the blinds and plunged the room into darkness . I sat heavily in my chair and stared numbly at nothing . I tumbled into the yawning void , the nothingness of my soul , and I shut my eyes and tried very hard to remember .
This morning , I woke up in tears . A nightmare , *again* . It 's been months since the last time I managed to sleep a whole night . I looked at the time . The night was n't over , but it was too late to get back to sleep ... not that I could either way . I stayed still in my bed , looking at the ceiling , until it became too uncomfortable . Slowly , I got up and started walking towards the kitchen when I remembered I had n't emptied the box in days . Ah , yes . *The box* . What was I thinking when I decided to use that thing ? Nothing positive ever came out of it since I put it here . And at this point , I knew nothing ever would . I could just have stopped emptying it ; eventually it would be full of unwanted emotions and that would be the end of the story . But I was already getting consumed from the inside , might as well keep going . I approached the box cautiously , dreading what was waiting for me inside of it . As I got closer , I peeked inside . Pitch black , as usual . I put my hand inside the box , retrieving all these unwanted emotions for myself , one after the other . As I went through the content of the box , the world seemed darker , colder . Until I found something that was n't supposed to be inside the box . Unlike all the previous ones , this one was bright . As I made it mine , I suddenly felt ... warm , as if someone covered me with soft blankets out of nowhere . This was something I never experienced before , this was ... pleasant . I emptied the rest of the box , holding tight to this newfound feeling to avoid getting overwhelmed . I was relieved for a moment , but then I realized . This was the box of unwanted emotions , why would someone get rid of such a great thing ? On the side of the box , someone had left a letter . `` I am not a good person , I did unforgivable things . I do not deserve to be happy anymore but to repent until my last breath . But you , you 're good . You keep taking people 's unwanted emotions even though they 're always negative . You deserve happiness more than I do , so take mine . Farewell . ''
**The vessel** Part 1 *We live in a world where we are our own worst enemies , the only thing stopping us from achieving our dreams is ourselves . Our doubts , our jealousy , our fears hinder us more than any rules , any government and any physical limitations . Luckily there are people who can take away our obstacles -- our emotions .. for a price . These men , and they were invariably men , are known as vessels . * David was sitting on a window of his penthouse , one arm draped across a gargoyle staring at the river in the distance . He looked back at the gargoyle . It was silent , just like his corner of his city , with only a few distant pops puncturing the silence . The masses who came over to churn the billions of dollars that kept the country had fled the neighborhood as they always did at night , especially on a holiday . He tightened his grip on the gargoyle , and looked down at the pavement hundreds of feet below . Today , he would be free . And then stopped . The whispering wind became a violent hurricane , his knuckles gripping the gargoyle head in a death vice became white and all breath left him . Fear . His feet had turned to lead and would not let him take that one extra step . All he could think of now was his own screaming . He had become a stricken animal void of all control . David stepped back into his apartment and collapsed into his chair . The air filled his lungs again as he became his normal analytical self . Independence would not be his tonight . Fear had saved his life tonight , as it had done every day , every day , every day for a long time now . He followed the gaze of the stone gargoyle to the barges enveloped in smoke . On the banks of the river , stood the thousands of people of the city and beyond . They filled with joy and happiness at the fireworks exploding above them . David could almost feel their happiness . Almost , but never quite . David now had a new quest . To give himself the gift of happiness .
I have had a fairly empty life . I can not feel as ordinary people do . I do not mean I am a stoic – no , I simply can not feel of my own accord . I can not feel what people call sadness , or joy , or anger , or lust , or literally any of the countless emotions I have read about , or heard . All my life , I have lived life in a very utilitarian , practical way – I am not attached to anything other than that I own it , or it owns me . My parents were my caretakers , and I was supposed to care for them back , and do as they say – whether it was good for me or bad for me , I couldn ’ t care less . They say they love me , but I do not know what love means . My mum cries holding my hand sometimes , and I just sit there . Music does nothing to me , books are just words , and movies are a scientific marvel that I watch for the cinematic tricks . My 6-year-old dog , Scruffy used to go crazy over me whenever I got home from school , barking madly and racing around . To me he was just a being that depends on me for survival – if I don ’ t feed it it ’ ll die . I wasn ’ t happy that it loved me so much , I didn ’ t mind when it chewed up my shoes , I didn ’ t worry when it was sick and needed to be taken to the vet . I didn ’ t cry when I had to give it that fatal injection . Why should I ? It had run its life ’ s course and needed to die . The vet looked at me all funny when Scruffy passed on and I didn ’ t even blink . I tried to fake cry ( knowing it was the right thing to do ) , and yet could hardly squeeze out a tear . Sigh… I needed to do something about it . I searched around and found this obscure subreddit wherein people could donate unwanted emotions – so that they could simply not feel sometimes , when they “ wanted to get away from it all ” , whatever that meant . I dug deeper , and found that there a way to access those emotions . I figured , why not , and signed up for it . Immediately , I felt a constriction in my chest , like I was just going to die . I could hardly breath , and sweat broke out all over me . I felt like I should run , and hide somewhere , just go away and escape everything . I couldn ’ t explain what was wrong , I just wanted to be safe somewhere far away and to be okay again . And yet , I couldn ’ t feel up to moving or doing anything , apart from just sitting there drenched in sweat , heart thumping wildly and yet feeling unable to breath . Was this… fear ? The next moment , the crushing feeling was gone , but I felt weak all over , like my body was bereft of all energy . My heart slowed to a crawl , and my head felt heavy . I felt like something had gone really wrong , and there was nothing more left in this world for me . Everything seemed dull and lifeless , and the world itself felt sluggish and meaningless . My eyes started to hurt , and for the first time in my life , I cried . I cried , hard , tears drenching my face . I realized that that was what sadness felt like . Ever since that day , I have felt a myriad of emotions each time someone donates to the subreddit . I have felt the helplessness and the mindlessness of anxiety , I have felt my blood boil and the urge to smash everything from anger , I have felt what it means to regret something – the devastating feeling ( I can feel ! ! ) of having lost , of having committed a big mistake . I have felt the hot flush of envy , the listlessness of sloth , the occasional glimmer of pride , and rarely , the tantalizing grip of lust . Why do I not simply break away , you ask ? Because at least I can feel something ... maybe I am able to help people by taking away whatever they might be feeling at a bad time ? But the truth is I do not want to go back to the listless existence I had – going through the motions of life – existing and not living . I read somewhere that it pain makes one human – if that is what it takes , this is what I will do . All my life ( it ’ s been nearly two decades since Scruffy passed away ) , I have borne this by myself , and not told many people about this . But today I want to share this with you , and all the world . Today I felt happiness . My heart beat faster , but this was a different one . It felt like it was pumping actual warmth instead of just blood . I felt energy coursing through me , like I could do anything in the world . My head was in the clouds , and I was laughing . I found myself running , feeling the wind in my hair and the sun in my face . Everything seemed bathed in a warm glow , and everyone I crossed in the street seemed to be smiling . I felt a sting in my eye , and tears flowed , but these were different from what sadness felt like , and I did not want this to stop ever . I wanted to cry , and somehow I knew it was okay . I cried , I laughed , I jumped , and all around me people were looking at me . Some were incredulous , some cautious , but soon so many of them were smiling and laughing – not at me , but with me . A few joined in with me as I danced , and soon I had all of them in good spirits , practically bouncing as they walked away . With one last whoop , I felt it fading away . I tried to clutch at it , but it was gone . And here I was , Empty , as always . If anyone is reading this , please , I beg you . Please . Share your happiness .
I volunteer at the homeless shelter , not because I think I 'm a good person or anything like that , but because I felt like I needed something to do . I just wanted to help at first . Anyways , I serve broth , bread , all the same plain boring stuff . Reminds me of myself a long time ago . That was until I saw the faces of the people I was serving . They were hopeless , sad and dreary . And when someone like me serves those kinds of people it kinda rubs off onto you . I was n't happy . I knew I had a purpose but I did n't enjoy it . That was until I saw two strangers walk up to me holding hands . They were *smiling* . Just looking at how happy they were made me realize how happy I should be . I have a stable life , they do n't , and what do I make of it ? For now on I 'm going to smile when I serve the homeless . After all , everyone can use a little happy in thier lives . I sure did : ) .
A life loved on the emotions of other had yet proved to be worth anything at all ... for so far my life had been filled with nothing but that deep ache in the ribcage you feel when your heart is breaking . Sometimes I found relief from this feeling in a distention emotion that was totally numb , lifeless , like I had become totally devoid of anything within pith than a dull and repetitive ache reminding me of what once was . Last but not least , the experience of total paralysis gripping my body all over add if tensed for a marathon in anticipation of some imminent or distant `` thing . '' I had come to know these emotions well and sometimes overlapping or without differentiation . One day , a Thursday , sometime in October , I remember waking up to the usual droll . However , little did I know today would be the first day I had really lived . Today my life , totally dependent on the emotions of others that wetter left over , donated , to me , in a silly box , would change forever . It was if my eyes had seen colors for the first time , I noticed the vividness of reach color and how it sparkled a certain way in the sunlight , a giant weight lifted from my chest I could feel my voice burst forth with confidence into a song . I was able to notice the interactions of others and feel this emotion ... . a sorry of glowing ... .from within ? I felt this when watching other people interact in a way that was without jealousy , sadness , nostalgia ... . The feeling of the warmth of sunlight on my skin and the wind bristling my hair . What was this feeling ? Happiness . Maybe tomorrow would be back to the usual droll ; but today was a different day ... . Then I noticed another feeling welling up within my hearts center ... like maybe not everything would always be bad . Someone had enough extra happiness to share it with me , maybe it could happen again . Maybe I could live more days in this way , in this state of mind that appreciates the present moment like never before . Hope ? For once in my life it was all worth it , everything in the world was right , worth it somehow .
The sun was setting on the horizon , its orange rays casting a warm glow over the city . People were hurrying home , their shadows stretching out in the fading light . Cars drove by , their headlights piercing the dusk . A cool breeze blew , rustling the leaves of the trees . Birds flew overhead , their chirps echoing in the air . The sky was a deep blue , the stars beginning to twinkle . In the distance , a church bell tolled , its sound carrying through the night . A dog barked , its tail wagging in excitement . The night was peaceful , the world at rest . All was still , the silence broken only by the sound of crickets . The moon rose , its silver light bathing the land . The night was beautiful , its beauty unrivaled . Peace .
The city was bustling with activity as usual . People of all shapes and sizes , from all walks of life , were going about their daily lives . But there was something different about this city . Everyone had a power . Some could move objects with their minds , some could control electricity , some could sense things that others could n't , and some had powers that no one else could even begin to comprehend . Everyone was ranked according to their power . I was the highest ranked of all , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a closely guarded secret , and I had no intention of revealing it to anyone . I had been at the top for a long time , and I had no intention of giving up my position . I had seen what happened to those who tried to challenge me . They were quickly dispatched , their powers taken away and their rank reduced . I had become a symbol of fear and respect in the city . People whispered my name in hushed tones , and no one dared to challenge me . But then one day , a new challenger appeared . He was powerful , and he was determined to take my place at the top . He had heard the rumors about me , and he was determined to prove that he was the strongest . The battle was fierce , and I was pushed to my limits . But in the end , I emerged victorious . I had defeated my challenger , and I had kept my place at the top . But I had also learned something about myself in the process . I had discovered the source of my power . I had discovered that I had the ability to absorb the powers of those I defeated . From that day forward , I used my newfound power to protect the city and its people . I had become a symbol of hope and strength , and I was determined to use my power for good . No one knew what my power was , but they all knew that I was the strongest . I was the one at the top , and I would remain there for as long as I could .
Prologue . The sun was setting over the horizon , casting a brilliant orange glow across the sky . The air was still and quiet , the only sound coming from the gentle rustling of the trees in the nearby forest . It was a peaceful evening , and yet something felt off . There was a tension in the air , a feeling of anticipation that seemed to hang over the land . Suddenly , a loud crash echoed through the air , followed by a deep rumbling that shook the ground beneath their feet . The sky lit up with a brilliant flash of light , and a figure appeared in the sky . The figure was a woman , her long white hair billowing in the wind . She wore a long white dress that seemed to shimmer in the light , and her eyes were a deep blue that seemed to pierce through the darkness . She hovered in the sky , her gaze sweeping across the land below . She seemed to be searching for something , and then her eyes settled on a small village in the distance . The woman descended from the sky , her feet touching the ground with a gentle thud . She walked towards the village , her steps slow and deliberate . As she approached , the villagers gathered around her , their eyes wide with fear and awe . The woman spoke , her voice soft and melodic . `` I am here to bring you a message , '' she said . `` A message of hope and of change . A message that will shape the future of this land , and of all who inhabit it . '' The villagers listened in silence , their eyes wide with wonder . `` The time has come , '' the woman continued . `` The time for a new beginning . A time for a new era . A time for heroes to rise . '' The woman paused , her gaze sweeping across the crowd . `` Are you ready ? '' she asked . The villagers nodded , their faces filled with determination . `` Then let us begin , '' the woman said . And with that , the adventure began .

The city was bustling with activity as usual , but today was different . Today , the people of the city were abuzz with excitement . Today was the day of the annual ranking ceremony , where the citizens of the city were ranked according to their powers . The rankings were based on a variety of factors , including the strength and control of their powers , as well as their ability to use them in creative ways . Everyone was eager to find out where they stood in the rankings , and who would be the city 's most powerful citizen .

I had no intention of letting anyone take my place as the city 's most powerful citizen .

She said she only loved him . John had been in love with Sarah for years , but he was too afraid to tell her . He had watched her from afar , admiring her beauty and grace . One day , he mustered up the courage to tell her how he felt . He nervously approached her and said , `` Sarah , I love you . '' To his surprise , she smiled and said , `` I love you too , John . '' He was overjoyed , but then she added , `` But I only love you as a friend . '' John was crushed , but he tried to remain strong . He thanked her for being honest and walked away . As he walked away , he heard her whisper , `` I only love him . ''
At first , I was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I felt like I was being bombarded by a wave of unfamiliar feelings . I was scared and confused , but I also felt a strange sense of joy . I had never experienced happiness before , and it was a strange and wonderful sensation . I started to explore the emotion , and soon I found myself smiling and laughing more often . I felt lighter and more energized . I was able to appreciate the beauty of the world around me in a way I had never been able to before . The donation box has become a source of comfort and joy for me . I 'm grateful for the person who donated happiness to me , and I 'm thankful for the opportunity to experience such a wonderful emotion .
She said she only loved him . John had been in love with Sarah for years , but he had never been able to tell her how he felt . He was too scared of rejection and of ruining their friendship . But one day , he finally mustered up the courage to tell her his true feelings . He was expecting her to laugh in his face or to tell him that she did n't feel the same way . But instead , she looked him in the eyes and said , `` I only love you . '' John was taken aback by her response . He could n't believe that she felt the same way .

Once I had gained his trust , I began to subtly influence his decisions and actions . I encouraged him to make decisions that would ultimately lead to his downfall . I convinced him to make bad investments , to alienate his allies , and to make rash decisions that would ultimately lead to his downfall . By the time the war had begun , I had already set in motion a series of events that would lead to Hitler 's eventual downfall .

I had successfully killed Hitler without ever having to lift a finger . My creativity and subtle approach to killing Hitler earned me the championship title .

I won the championship last year by traveling back to April 30 , 1945 , the day of Hitler 's suicide . I had to be creative and think outside the box . Instead of killing Hitler myself , I decided to use the environment around me to my advantage . I started by finding a way to tamper with the bunker 's ventilation system . I knew that Hitler was very sensitive to carbon monoxide , so I was able to slowly pump it into the bunker . Over the course of a few days , the carbon monoxide levels in the bunker slowly increased , making it difficult for Hitler to breathe . I also found a way to manipulate the bunker 's temperature , making it unbearably hot . This , combined with the carbon monoxide , made it impossible for Hitler to stay in the bunker for any length of time . Finally , I used my time travel device to manipulate the bunker 's lighting , making it seem like it was night time all day . This , combined with the heat and carbon monoxide , caused Hitler to become increasingly paranoid and desperate . On April 30 , 1945 , Hitler was so desperate and paranoid that he took his own life . I had successfully used the environment around me to kill Hitler without having to do it myself . It was a creative and difficult solution that earned me the championship .

Hitler was so focused on his own safety that he never noticed the traps I had set . When he finally emerged from the bunker , he was immediately taken out by one of my snipers . The judges were impressed by my ingenuity and awarded me the championship . I was proud of my accomplishment , and I knew that my victory would have a lasting impact on the world .
It was a typical day in the city . People were going about their business , walking around , buying food , and generally just going about their day . But there was something different about this day , something that no one could quite put their finger on . In the middle of the city , a figure stood atop a building , surveying the city below . This figure was me , and I was the most powerful person in the city . No one knew what my power was , not even me . I had been born with the power of rank 1 , and no one knew what it was or how I had obtained it . All they knew was that I was the most powerful person in the city . I had been born with a great responsibility , and I had been warned not to abuse my power . I had been told that I could use my power to kill someone of a higher rank and obtain their rank . But I had never done so . I had never wanted to be a murderer , and I had never wanted to take away someone else 's power . But now , I was starting to feel the pressure . I could feel the eyes of the people below me , watching me , waiting for me to make a move . I could feel the anticipation in the air . Everyone wanted to know what my power was , and what I was going to do with it . I looked down at the city , and I knew that I had to make a decision . I could either use my power to kill someone of a higher rank and obtain their rank , or I could keep my power and remain the most powerful person in the city . I closed my eyes and took a deep breath . I knew what I had to do . I had to use my power to protect the people of the city . I had to use my power for good , not for evil . With that thought in mind , I opened my eyes and used my power to create a force-field around the city . It was a barrier that no one could penetrate without my permission . The people of the city were safe now , and I was the most powerful person in the city . I had finally made the decision to use my power for good , and I was happy with my choice . I had become the # 1 ranked person in the city , and I had used my power for good . I had protected the people of the city , and I was proud of myself

As Hitler began to feel the effects of the poison , he quickly made his way to the podium to give his speech . As he began to speak , he suddenly collapsed and died . The crowd was in shock and I was able to slip away unnoticed . My victory was hailed as one of the most creative and difficult kills in history . I was awarded the highest score ever given and was crowned the champion of time travel .

He was lost in a vast , seemingly endless desert . The sun beat down on him relentlessly , no shade in sight . Sweat dripped from his forehead as he trudged along , sand shifting beneath his feet . How had he gotten here ? He had no recollection of the events that lead him to this desolate place . He sighed and kept walking , hoping to find something , anything that could help him . Suddenly , he noticed a faint glimmer in the distance . He quickened his pace , his spirits lifting . As he drew nearer , he could make out a small oasis , a single palm tree standing tall in the center . He collapsed to his knees in relief , tears streaming down his face . Salvation .
Prologue . The sun was setting on a crisp autumn night in the small town of Oakridge . The sky was a deep navy blue , and the stars twinkled in the darkness . The air was still and quiet , the only sound being the occasional chirp of a cricket . It was the perfect night for a walk . Willow , a young woman in her early twenties , had been feeling restless all day . She had been living in Oakridge for almost a year now , but it still felt unfamiliar . She had been itching for an adventure , something to break up the monotony of her everyday life . So , when the sun began to set , she grabbed her coat and set off on a stroll through the town . She walked past the old brick buildings and the quaint little shops , and she felt a sense of peace wash over her . As she walked , she noticed a small , dimly lit alleyway tucked between two of the buildings . Curiosity got the better of her , and she decided to investigate . The alleyway was empty , save for a single door at the far end . Willow approached the door , and to her surprise , it was unlocked . She stepped inside , and the door shut behind her with a thud . The room she found herself in was dark and musty . She could see the faint outline of a desk and chair in the corner , but other than that , the room was empty . As her eyes adjusted to the darkness , she noticed a large wooden chest sitting in the center of the room . Willow stepped forward and lifted the lid of the chest . Inside were a pile of old , yellowing documents . She grabbed one of the documents and began to read . What she read changed her life forever .

I had lived in this city my entire life and seen people with powers all around me . I had seen people with telekinesis , electrokinesis , and even some with sensors . I had even seen people with more than one power , although that was rare . Everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were , and I was the highest . Everyone knew I was the strongest , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret because I knew if anyone found out what my power was , they would come after me . I had seen people kill each other for the chance to take someone else ’ s rank , and I didn ’ t want to be the next victim . I had to be careful and keep my power hidden . I had friends in the city , but I never told them my secret . I was content to stay in the shadows , but then something changed . Someone started to threaten me , saying that they knew what my power was and that they were going to use it against me . I had to find out who this person was and stop them before they revealed my power and put me in danger . I started asking around and eventually tracked down the person who had been threatening me . It turned out that it was someone I had gone to school with , a girl who had always been jealous of me and my rank . She had figured out my power and wanted to use it to take my rank and become the most powerful person in the city . I confronted her and told her that I would never let her take my rank . She didn ’ t believe me and said that I was too weak to stop her . I smiled and said that she was wrong , and then I revealed my power . I had the power of transformation . I could transform into any animal or object I wanted , and I used this power to defeat her . She was shocked and couldn ’ t believe that I had such a powerful ability . I told her that I would always be the strongest in the city , and she had to accept that . She eventually conceded , and I kept my rank as the most powerful person in the city . I kept my power a secret from everyone , and I vowed to use it only for good . I knew that if I ever used it for evil , I would become just like the people I had seen fight for rank .

The judges were stunned at my ingenuity and awarded me the championship title .
At first , I did n't know what to do with the donated emotion of happiness . I had never experienced it before and it was overwhelming .

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes , and as I did , I felt a warmth spreading throughout my body . It was a sensation I had never felt before , and it was amazing . I wanted to share this feeling with others , so I started to visit homeless shelters and orphanages to give away the happiness I had found in the donation box . Everywhere I went , I could see the impact of my donations . People were smiling and laughing , and I could feel my own joy growing with each act of kindness . I continued to donate my happiness and as I did , I started to experience other emotions too . I felt empathy , joy , and even love . I was amazed at how much donating my happiness had changed my life , and I was determined to continue doing so . The donation box was my way of sharing the happiness I had found in the box with others , and it was the best decision I had ever made .

Last year , I traveled back in time to Nazi Germany with a single mission in mind : to kill Adolf Hitler . In order to maximize my score and make the mission as difficult as possible , I had come up with a plan that I thought was pretty creative . I traveled to the year 1938 and made my way to the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich , Germany , where Hitler was scheduled to give a speech that evening . Knowing that he would be surrounded by bodyguards , I decided I had to come up with a way to get rid of them without raising too much suspicion . My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to 1938 earlier in the day . Then , I used some of my modern day technology to create a diversion . I hacked into the PA system at the Bürgerbräukeller and broadcast a message that a bomb was set to go off in the building . The message caused mass panic and everyone evacuated , including Hitler ’ s bodyguards . With the bodyguards out of the way , I was able to sneak in unnoticed and find Hitler . I quickly pulled out my handgun and shot him twice , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was awarded the highest score of the year . I was the undisputed champion of time traveling Hitler-killers .
I won last year 's championship by successfully executing the most difficult and creative time-travel mission yet : Killing Hitler in the middle of World War II . To start , I had to plan out exactly when and where Hitler would be . I used a combination of various historical records and intelligence sources to determine his exact whereabouts at any given moment . Once I had this information , I was able to plan out the time travel route I would need to take . Next , I had to acquire the necessary materials and equipment for the mission . I had to make sure I had the right weapon , enough ammunition and other supplies to get the job done . I also had to make sure I had a way to get in and out of the situation safely . Finally , I was ready to go . I traveled back to the year 1944 and arrived at my destination . After a few tense moments , I was able to corner Hitler in a room and I shot him . I then made my escape back to the present day . My mission was a success and I was declared the champion for the year .

As the inhabitants of the small town went about their daily routine , a figure emerged from the shadows . Clad in a simple black cloak , the figure was of indeterminate gender and age . They were wearing a hood that concealed their face , and they had a large bag slung over their shoulder . The figure stopped and looked around . Their eyes were cold and calculating , and they seemed to take in their surroundings with a detached curiosity . After a few moments , they closed their eyes , inhaled deeply , then moved on . The figure continued down the street , heading for a small inn at the end of the road .

Without warning , they took a small object from their bag and held it up to the sky . As a ray of sunlight shone down through the clouds and illuminated the object , a magical , wondrous feeling filled the air .

The wizard , an old and grizzled man , told the King that the only way to defeat the beast was to create a new weapon- one made of the strongest and purest materials . He warned the King that this weapon would be powerful enough to destroy the beast , but could also prove perilous to the wielder . The King , desperate to rid his kingdom of the beast , ordered his best smiths and craftsmen to create the weapon . After much hard work , the weapon was completed- a mighty sword of hammered steel , inlaid with jewels and crafted to be both beautiful and lethal . The King armed several of his bravest warriors with the weapon and they set off to confront the beast atop the mountain . The beast was fierce and strong , but the warriors and their new weapon proved too powerful and it was soon vanquished . The Kingdom was saved and the King awarded the brave warriors with great honors , the weapon was kept safe in the treasury and the great wizard vanished as mysteriously as he had arrived . This is the tale of the sword they called , The Slayer of Beasts .

Little did the small family out on a cross-country road trip know , but in a few short moments their lives would be transformed forever .

With little hope of rescue , they knew the only way to survive was to rely on one another . But what happened next ? Did they manage to find their way back to civilization or did they instead find something more forever changing than they could have ever imagined ?
It was a beautiful day in the tiny town of Lennox , Montana . The morning sun was shining brightly , with birds chirping cheerfully in the trees and the lingering smell of freshly cut grass wafting through the air . Sara woke up early that morning , just like she did every day . She stretched and cracked a small smile . She loved the mornings . It was her time to reflect on the day before , to think about what she was going to do that day and to just be present in the moment . Today was special , though . It was the day that she was moving to a new home , a small ranch on the outskirts of town . It was the start of a totally new chapter in her life and she was excited to begin . She had packed her things the night before , so now all that was left was to get into her car and go . Sara jumped out of bed , got dressed and grabbed her bag . She grabbed a piece of toast from the kitchen , took a quick swig of coffee and headed for her car . She tossed her bag into the trunk , hopped inside , and started the engine . Sara drove down the familiar roads and through the winding countryside . As she passed through the picturesque farmlands and rolling hills , she felt a sense of peace come over her . She breathed deeply and felt a warmth spread through her veins . This was the start of something new , and she was ready for whatever came her way . The sun was beginning to set as she pulled into the long driveway of her new home . She stepped out of the car and looked around . The ranch was a little rundown , but it was home . As she stepped onto the porch , she closed her eyes and embraced the feeling of finally being in her own place . Sara opened the door , stepped inside , and smiled . She was finally home .
At first , I was unsure what to make of this new emotion . I expected it to be uncomfortable like the rest of the emotions I was used to . But gradually , as I felt the warmth in my chest and the corners of my mouth lift upwards , I realized it was something strangely familiar . The days that followed were filled with newfound joy . Experiencing this emotion was like discovering a new language , one that was increasingly understandable . I was in awe of its beauty , so gentle yet so powerful . All of a sudden , life was brighter and more meaningful . I continued to experience and embrace the full range of emotions donated by others . With each emotion I encountered , I gained more insight into the complexities of existence . Life was no longer a series of mundane tasks . With every emotion , I felt more alive . The donation box became an essential part of my life . Whenever I felt overwhelmed , I would go and find a few more emotions to explore . I started to see them as gifts , a way to learn more about the world and myself . And soon enough , I began to understand what it truly meant to have a heart full of emotions .
It had been decades since the city of Illumina was first populated by people with extraordinary powers , and I was the most powerful inhabitant . With every passing day , my strength was growing and expanding , and so was my sense of superiority . I had reached the very pinnacle of power and status , ranking # 1 on the power charts that the city kept , yet no one knew what my special ability was . This mystery intrigued onlookers and journalists alike , who would often pester me to reveal my secret . I would simply shake my head and smile , relishing in my anonymity . I was content to keep my powers hidden , but I was aware that it made me vulnerable to attack . After all , in Illumina , no one was meant to be more powerful than the others , and anyone of lower rank could theoretically kill someone of higher rank , thereby obtaining their rank and power . But that never happened , despite of the constant threat of incite . Those beneath me knew better than to challenge me , for there were those that had witnessed my power firsthand - once , a person of lower rank had attempted to steal my rank , but their veins were frozen solid when they touched me . Those around me had gasped at this mysterious reaction and I had lightly shrugged , not letting on to the fact that it was my telekinetic ability that had caused the reaction . Nevertheless , I was thankful for the kind of power that wielded yet kept me safe : I was able to remain the # 1 rank , secure in the knowledge that no one would be able to challenge me . I had achieved my goal of keeping my true power hidden , and now I could enjoy the privilege of being atop the power rankings of Illumina .

The low hum of cicadas filled the air , a familiar precursor to the lazy summer days . Two children walked hand in hand through the woods , the high summer grass tickling their bare legs . Their laughter drifted through the trees , cutting through the oppressive heat and humidity . The sun was a hazy ball of orange in the sky , as if it could n't be bothered to shine through the veil of grey clouds . The taller of the two children stopped suddenly , pointing excitedly ahead . “ What ’ s that ? ” he asked , his voice a mixture of wonder and awe . His companion , a small girl with curly ringlets , giggled . “ I don ’ t know ! Let ’ s go see ! ” The pair hurried forwards , their curiosity taking them through the overgrown wilderness and up towards a large , white stone house . Neither of them knew how they had come across such a place , but they knew they had never seen anything quite like it . They ran around the grounds , exploring and imagining what life must have been like here . As they stood on the back porch , something caught their eyes . A glimmer of light shone brightly from the window of one of the upstairs rooms . The children looked at each other for a moment , before running inside , eager to learn what was hidden in the old house . What they found within was far greater than anything they could have imagined . In the corner of that room lay a large , leather bound book . Its cover was weathered and worn , but still strong enough to hold back the secrets that lay within its pages . The two children looked at each other in excitement , before settling on the floor and carefully opening the book . They read its words together , entranced by the mysterious tale inside . Little did they know , but their lives were forever changed - in just that moment . This was the beginning of a story they were destined to write , the adventure they were meant to go on . It was the start of a journey they never could have expected . With eagerness and enthusiasm , they read , and as the pages flew by , so too did their imaginations . Soon , they were swept away with the story - who had written it , what secrets it held , where it might take them . One thing was for sure , this was a tale to be told .
First Paragraph : The rain pattered against the window , its noise like a soothing lullaby . I lay in bed , too scared to move , my head still spinning from what had happened earlier that day . Last Paragraph : I shook my head and sighed . I was n't sure how I would get out of this one , but I knew that I would have to try . Taking a deep breath , I steeled my nerves and prepared to face the music . No matter what happened , I would have to soldier on and hope that I could make it through the storm .
I woke up with a start . I looked around my small one bedroom apartment . I had lived here my whole life , yet today it felt different . I felt a surge of power in me , a power that I had never felt before . I felt a chill run down my spine as I got out of bed , as if something was calling out to me . Something big was about to happen , I could feel it inside me . I was the only one living in my city who was rank # 1 , but nobody knew what my power was . Little did they know , that my power was something that not even the strongest of warriors could match up to . I made my way to the window and peered out . My city was bustling with activity . Citizens were walking their dogs , couples strolling through the park , children laughing as they played , it all seemed so normal . But then I heard it : the sound of people fighting , of glass breaking , of screams of terror . Looking down , I saw a group of people , their hands glowing with energy as they fought each other . I felt drawn to the action like a moth to a flame . Without realizing it , I found myself at the door of my apartment , my heart racing . I wanted to fight and prove my power to the world - but I had to be smart . I had to protect myself and I knew that I could not expose my secret . I stepped out into the alley and watched as the fight progressed . I saw a woman with her fingers glowing with electricity , as she used her power to control the fight . I studied her movements , memorizing every one . Then , suddenly , I felt something shift inside me . I raised my hands , and before I knew it , I had zapped the woman , rendering her unconscious . I was shocked . What power did I possess ? My secret was finally out . All the citizens of my city were staring at me in awe and disbelief . I had taken down the strongest among them - the one who was rank # 1 - and gained my own rank through sheer willpower and strength . In that moment , I understood that my true power was believing in myself . No matter what obstacles I face , as long as I believe in my own strength , I can achieve anything .

Prologue The night was a velvety blanket dappled with stars . A cool breeze blew through the quiet alleyways , carrying whispers of distant adventure and possibility .

Then , with determination , he strode forward into the darkness , eager to begin his quest . The future awaited .

Suddenly , a voice filled the air : their destination had been reached . The passengers began to disembark , but she remained in her seat . What if they discovered her secret ?

Last year , I won the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler championship by pulling off a wild and creative maneuver . I traveled back in time to a moment when Hitler was about to launch a public speech . I infiltrated the room and quickly swapped out all of Hitler 's notes with some of my own . My notes contained various mathematical riddles and perplexing equations . As Hitler began to refer to these notes during his speech he soon became completely lost and confused . He stumbled around for a bit , desperately trying to make sense of the words on the page . Eventually , Hitler became so frustrated and confused that he threw a fit and had to be removed from the stage . That was enough to trigger a chain of events leading to his eventual downfall and sealing my victory .
The city was abuzz with news of amazing abilities . The people had exraordinary power , ranging from telekinesis to electrokinesis and a variety of sensors . They were ranked according to how powerful they were and the strongest one was me . I was Number 1 but nobody knew what my power was . It was rumored in the city that gaining power was as simple as killing someone of higher rank and taking their power . This was done without any moral compunction . In fact , the idea was embraced with a voraciousness by some . I knew this would put me in danger but I also knew I was the strongest and the only way for someone to take my power was to kill me . I wanted to keep my power a secret for as long as possible . I started to research my power and it became clear to me that I had the abilities to heal people using just my touch . I realized that if my secret became known , I would be in high demand considering the nature of the power I possessed . But again , it was risky . I had to be careful in who I trusted and how I used my power . I was determined to stay in the Number 1 spot as long as I could and to help the people I wanted to help without putting my life or my power in danger . It worked . I was in the Number 1 spot for several years and I was able to help many people in need with my power . I was even able to restore some people back to full health . Eventually though , rumors of my power spread and people were starting to figure out what it was . I had to stay vigilant and be careful in how I used my power to stay safe . But no matter how careful I was , it was inevitable that someone would figure out what my power was and challenge me for my rank . I was ready for them , though , and never backed down . I was able to maintain my rank as Number 1 for many years . I felt a great sense of accomplishment . I was the strongest in the city and had saved many people . I had no regrets .
I won the championship last year by coming up with a plan that no one else had ever thought of- and more importantly , a plan that no one else would be able to do . I knew that I had to come up with a truly original and effective way of killing Hitler that did n't rely on brute force . I did a lot of research and eventually came up with an idea . I traveled back to 1939- just before Hitler was about to order the invasion of Poland . I had already learned that German plans were severely under-prepared in case of any resistance , and I knew I had to be careful . I did n't do anything overt- Hitler continued with his plans , unchanged . But what I did do was subtly shift the course of things enough that morale dropped drastically and a sense of urgency was never developed . Germany did n't lose a lot of men in the war , but it was enough to completely undermine their entire effort . After a few months had passed , Hitler had no choice but to retreat and sue for peace . In the aftermath of the war , Hitler was left a broken mess , and the allies stripped him of all his power and authority . His life , as he knew it , was completely over . And that was that . I won the championship by killing Hitler without firing a single shot !

I had never felt anything like it before . It was as if a spark had been ignited inside me and I knew from that moment what it was to truly feel alive .

At first , you were surprised to find yourself here . Maybe you felt like it was unfair or strange ; you didn ’ t believe you deserved to be here . But soon , you began to realize that you were the one who had hurt yourself the most . You realize that it was you who had not treated yourself with kindness , love , and respect . You had refused to believe in yourself and had hurt your potential for happiness and success . You sit with yourself in the celestial room , your pain and regret palpable in the stillness . You talk , you apologize , you share your feelings and thoughts . It is a difficult but necessary process of self-forgiveness and self-love that is ultimately what it takes to reach this heavenly state . When it is over , you feel cleansed and whole and ready to take the next steps into eternity .
The air was still and the sky was clear , a perfect day to relax and laze out . Resting her head in her hands , she sighed into the cool evening breeze that ruffled through her hair . Thoughts of the past stirred and filled her heart with a calm emptiness , a strange comfort she had come to rely on . She wanted to stay outside and be with the night , alone with her memories . Closing her eyes , she slowly drifted away until ; peace .
Last year I won the champion of time travelers by coming up with a deviously tricky way to kill Hitler . I had already considered the traditional ways ( shooting , poisoning , other assassinations ) but wanted to use my own special twist . So , I went back in time and disguised myself as a German messenger . I then successfully smuggled a live bat in the Fuhrer ’ s office . After Hitler was distracted and used up all the paper in the room to swat the bat away , I quickly and quietly locked the door behind me . For the next week , Hitler was trapped inside , running out of oxygen until he suffocated . After the week was up , I returned back to the present , winning the award and becoming the Time Travel Champion for creative and difficult assassination of Hitler .
The sun shone brightly on the day the two of them decided to set out on a journey together .

At first I could n't quite understand what happiness looked like , or even how it felt . I soon realized , however , that it was like a spark of light that shot through my being , illuminating all darkness , filling me with a warmth and joy that I 'd never experienced before . It was like my soul had finally awoken from its long slumber , and I felt alive for the first time in my life . I started to explore new emotions and feelings , allowing myself to fully experience them in all their intensity . I savored the joy of laughing louder , the spark of feeling inspired , and the contentment of simply being . I quickly learned that I had only been half alive before , and that happiness was the key to finding wholeness . This newfound appreciation for life also encouraged me to continue donating my unwanted emotions to others , knowing that it was a generous act that could potentially impact someone else 's life in a meaningful way . I felt a strong need to help others find joy , just as somebody had done for me . Thank you , anonymous donor , for showing me the power of happiness .

She said she only loved him . Even Katie had her doubts about crafting a life with Brad , as they had met at a party just weeks prior . Some people said it was an act of foolishness — an establishment of temporary romance that carried a hefty price tag of ebb and flow highs and lows . But Katie had an urge for adventure she could n't shake , so she acted boldly and told Brad she only loved him . Even that 'd they 'd only known each other such a small fragment of time did n't make her decision any less deep . The set before the not even legal married couple left the surprisingly still decent apartment , bed spacious and clean under the creaking fan spirals . When it was time to leave , hunched beneath stale luggage wheeled chair , Brad wondered why she had come with him . Without a word , Katie offered him a faithful stare that said , `` I said I only loved you . '' Disbelieving the sparkling honesty in the words dripping jubilantly through the still-hot humid , thought he would never understand the ironclad meandering of the hollow heart in front of him . Nevertheless , he thanked her with a breezy peck of dull rose lips and warm eyes musing fate as they donned separate lives that , though separate , streaked into a singular sky . Katie said she only loved him , yet what will happen is matter of fortunes mercy of a divine creator .

I live in this city full of people with strange powers that shock , astound and awe . Each person is ranked according to these powers , and everyone knows where they stand in society . I am the apex of this world , with a coveted spot at the very top of the power rankings , yet nobody knows my own power—or at least , that 's how I would like to keep it . Since I have held the highest rank ever since I memory begins , the vigilant scrutiny of my authority rested heavily upon me . Keep a low profile , appear to be harmless and ultimately , invisible , that became my mantra . People have attempted a myriad of ways to ascend the rank , but all have been unsuccessful , and sometimes paid a deadly price . I silently enjoy my warm position in the firmament of my world , safe in knowledge that no one'sRank is higher than mine . Little do they know the depth and vastness of the power inside me . Yet as I turned my back on the people prompting to know more about the undefinable Gift I possess , I realise that it will stay a mystery as much as the true identities of myths and gods even the validity of my immortality . With every day , I look with skepticism and suspicion at those in my company , always weighing my options , yet never need nor endeavoreager to kill someone of higher ranking rank . As it is , my power is greater than any other and my reign over this City full of chthonic and kaedonic forces , will remain full dominion if I utterjust a word or two if needed . A throne of invisibility , but one I happily accept knowing deep down in my heartthat none can ever hope to provolette its paireme Throne of truth be told .
The city of Wilshar was beautiful and powerful . Everywhere you looked , you saw wonderfully vibrant colors and bustling communities . But what lent Wilshar it 's great power were the people living here . For the secret of Wilshar was that a vast majority possessed incredible powers , manifested as anything from electromagnetism to velocity manipulation to telepathy . Every so often , a shining new star appeared on the horizon and the rest of the city welcomed them , knowledge that this person was now among those able to influent the natural flow of the city all but certain . People , however powerful they may be , are prone to jealousy and envy , sometimes to deadly ends . A hidden form of currency had been established among the population , an informal power structure signifying your rank above and below your fellows . Those with similar rankings answered to one another , with the few at the very top vying for the highly sought number one spot . I was number one . Generations before my father previously held the title only to be felled in mysterious battle . I had inherited the station with a sword and a warning , cherishing could never be uttered . None of my subjects knowledge of my powers and to preserve the myth of my status , I with managed them with a deliciously firm hand while keeping all rivals and adversaries guess I was as secretive as the wind during those many sleepless nights . But secrets have a hard time staying secrets in a crowd full of superpowered people and my reign was beginning to sour . Every climb to the top is followed suitably with death threats and wary glares from those after my title . I knew this day was coming , though not sooner , and the grueling fight began , with the fate of the high number one quietly resting on the line . Who would prove strongest ? Who had the powers I could not fathom ? Nobody could know for sure until the next glorious morning , when the weak and questioning mutters fell into a sheer astonishment . For there was celebration when all loudly declared I still held the highest of honors that noone even seen me do anything to reach their . Of course , I knew innerly why they knew—that if I did let slip what I could do , there will be no number one anymore . But I still bask ecstatically under the lightheaded cheers of a city full of powers .
It was summertime in the smallest of towns - hibernation was not an option . Hot days stretched far and , when night finally fell , they melted away into an eerie silence . But one name , Spiers Montagu , brought that quiet to an end . His curious antics lit the midnight sky , an electrifying recipe of gossip and intrigue . Then came the news - the stranger in the forest woods was more than he seemed . Spies ? Conspiracy ? Did this man have something to hide ? As the locals quarreled andasked questions , the answers remained hidden . But this tiny Garden of Eden contained a secret truth and to uncover it , courage was needed . So on the eve of discovery , our small miners gathered their strength and courage and uncovered that which was finite and invisible - a connection . Unity .
The usually sunny town of Radford was in a haze . People felt stranded and helpless as their world had been suddenly ripped out from under their feet . Nothing was ever going to be the same again . Years later , many of its citizens were still trying to make sense of the events that had taken place in Radford on that fateful day , and few stories of what had truly happened were ever spoken .

Billy was a quiet young boy ; full of curiosity but short of courage . He wanted so badly to explore the exciting world outside of his cozy home . Life always seemed so much simpler within its walls . Every day his hopes appeared faded and fleeting ; that is until one fateful morning . The snow was falling heavy and fast , masking the usual bustling town with peaceful silence . Billy quickly tiptoed down the stairs and out the door , not daring to look up at his parents ' disapproving eyes . His heart pulsed with excitement as his imagination came alive with adventure . Snow settled on his lashes , tiny droplets that sparkled like hailstones . Poking gingerly with his stick , Billy probed the drifts for signs of animal homes or strange artifacts . No traditional boundaries could contain him here on this wintry blanketed field nearby his home . Things became a blur as he trudged further and further ; clearing paths that no one else had before . All the stories of lifes ' larger mysteries coyly tickled his consciousness . There was no more requirement to act the same , to live life like the others . Here he could be free . Then , as the gusts turned to blustering winds , everything seemed to still - yet move all the same . As if it it were intricately orchestrated specifically just for him . His heart no longer raced , it hummed with a deep contentment . At last , he was truly alive . Alive ...
The engine roared to life and the ground began rumbling as the train set off on its journey . Strangers , family members , and friends alike crowded the coach in preparation for the long hours ahead . The sound of crickets and cicadas outside grew steadily more intense as nightfall settled over the line crossing through Maryland . All heads began to droop and sleep embraced everyone aboard the train reverting it into an eerie and silent journey . That is until an explosive crash rent the air , suddenly snapping everyone awake to fright and confusion . Choking shadows of coal smoke blanketed each person and their bags , as fearful questions surged into minds without any answers . What had just happened and what were they now getting into ?
I staggered back in bemused shock at the unexpected feeling that surged through me . As I sampled this newfound emotion , my heart twitched and I felt a spark of happiness ignite within me . It took a few moments before I regained my composure and the awareness that this feeling was not coming from me- it had been donated to me ! I struggled to find the words to express my appreciation for the generous act of kindness , looking up gratefully at the stranger who had contributed such a gift from their own well of emotion . I could only stand there stunned , reaping emotions from this newfound understanding of the world around me that I had only vaguely understood before . Over the coming days and months , I found myself growing healthier and happy as I explored and grew with these donated emotions . I could never thank the anonymous donor enough , truly my life had been changed and was so much richer for it . Once this happiness was successfully incorporated into my life , I began to notice other more rarefied emotions bubbling up- pleasure , contentment , contentment- as if the happiness had opened the floodgates in my soul to other more complex feelings . The strange power of this donation still hums within me as I Reflect with a sense of accomplishment over having been given new roles beyond the dry receptacle of emotionless Nothingness . I savor every moment of these newly felt Judgments and accept and understand the notion that in life we are wiser to accept donations of that which binds and unifies us , than the toxic shame of what enslaves us . I have never shied away from sadness , fear and regret since feeling the hand of a better life through this kindness , I cherish being part of a world worth donating emotions to and championing new routes of feeling empathy and belonging .
First paragraph : Just after dark , a figure made their way over sand dunes , the moonlight barely reaching them . Not even a breeze rustled in the air as the person pushed forward through the night , their shadow always many steps ahead them as a warning . Last paragraph : The figure 's journey was almost complete , as their destination appeared in view , clouded only by the night 's veil . Heart pounding , they stopped , turning their head one last time to see what felt like an eternity of their journey left behind in the dark .
Patchy gray clouds cast a shadow on the sleepy town . Decaying leaves from Autumn lay buried on the ground . Up above streetlights glowed faintly in the arid air . A library stood untouched by all the commotion there . Within the musty halls forgotten secrets swept to sleep . Its bookshelves tall like embattled troops in keep . A single librarian shuffled silently around . Ageless face with shoes worn completely through the ground . Suddenly the daunting door creeks open to the light . That seals away forgotten tales day and night . A kid walks through standing still and amazed . Till he spots a book insight that 's displayed . Gold blue rippling wings illustrated front and back . Rectangles shape like oceans land that have to pack . All revealing adventurers of astronauts and more . Exhilarated he clicks it shut and gives a yore . Nobody heard a young boy dreamt and only time will tell , Ready .
At first , it was strange and foreign . I did n't know what to do with it or how to understand this feeling .

The happiness became a part of me and I noticed positive changes in myself and in the world around me . The donation box had given me a lifetime 's worth of joy and fulfilment in the short amount of time and it continues to do so to this day .

Once upon a time , there was a small village of only two people . One was an old , wise wizard and the other was a young , inexperienced apprentice . The wizard wanted to impart his wisdom onto the apprentice , so he took the young apprentice on a journey into the forest . The wizard pointed out creatures and plants the apprentice had never seen before . He pointed out the properties of different elements and explained the power of electricity and thunderstorms . The apprentice soaked in all the wizard 's knowledge eagerly , paying close attention to the lessons . At the center of the forest , the wizard pointed out a tall oak tree with branches that seemed to point to the heavens . “ This is the tree of knowledge . Plant your seed within it , and it shall bring wisdom , ” said the wizard . The apprentice , with growing excitement , planted the seed and bid farewell to the wizard , continuing his journey alone . Despite undiscovered dangers , the apprentice kept his faith knowing he would later reap the benefits from his hard work . After days of hard traveled , the apprentice eventually made it back to the village with the learnings from the wizard—and even more wisdom , bestowed from the tree of knowledge . With this newfound knowledge , the young apprentice eventually grew to become the leader of the village and passed on all he learned to its inhabitants . At the same time , villagers also noticed the oak tree at the center of the forest grew taller and stronger—increasing its wisdom further and further with each passing day . The moral of the story ? Hard work , dedication and belief will always pay off if you ’ re patient and put in the effort . If you want to grow wiser , keep planting your ideas and look out for the opportunities in life . Everything is connected , and the rewards are bountiful .

Many years ago , in a distant land , there lived an old , wise sorcerer who used his tremendous magical ability to bring peace and prosperity to the people of his realm . The sorcerer 's name was Master Groshiah . Every day , he worked tirelessly to create and improve upon various forms of magic . His patronage was beloved by the citizens of the land , who admired him for his understanding and proficiency of all the different aspects of the mystic arts . The people of that era whispered his name as a sort of cult , and it became currency in trade , begging to be explained over dinner in case you were particularly vengeful or out of reasonable affair . But not all was well , as some wished him ill and hoped to threaten the peace he helped create . But as fate might have it , no one should have feared , for the size of Groshiah was something no power could withstand . Yet despite his glory , Master Groshiah was a relatively misunderstood mage , quire half expecting something unforeseen to eventually claim him away from his beloved realm . As time had fly distant from him , he stumbled to research and try to make an answer to why he was slightly different , but failed to find anything of use or proof… It was during this time that he stumbled upon a sacred site with the power of confounding his atavistic soul . Experiencing what others would certainly deem a seizure , Master Groshiah entrusted himself the system spiritually and read a relevant encrypted text , developing not just a deeper insight , but a totally major magical might that endowed him with the proof of one truth : his destiny was a bigger one than anyone ever cared to draw . It lay in wait , as secrets frequent do , until he was old enough , physically and spiritually , throughout to unlock the piece of a prophecy laid down in stone , one that defined the potential of his life and glories foretold .

His pursuit to move beyond the limits of the dark heart of the land , to achieve a realm where those that claimed the traits given by their
Once upon a time there lived a little mouse who was brave and kind and set out on an adventure to explore the world . He started his journey by sneaking away from his home underground into the shimmering seashore across the glistening river lit by the golden moon .

He scavenged for food , drank from streams , sung songs and told stories until reaching to the capital at the World Edge Cities . Here , he found a metropolis filled with streets and sidewalks bustling with Life ! So brightly colored it dazzled the little mouse ’ s eyes . A delightful marketplace filled with strange sights and exotic creatures singing and carrying on in loud chorus rolled with laughter and merriment . Good smells of spices and delectable sweets made his mouth water , not to mention surprises around every corner . After visiting for a while the mouse proceeded on toward his small hometown but had been on quite the marvelous new world journey . He brought home an abundant toy chest and spoke of his intercontinental explorations to which all his brothers and sisters marveled around the little campfire in the vast night sky . From that day on , the greedy king of the mountain held an ambitious dream to explore the limitless horizon and followed the footsteps of a heroic little mouse into unprecedented discovery and worlds of endless details awaiting unto him .

Shards of Sunshine , by Valentine Starre Once upon a time , in the furthest reaches of Nebaliya , there ’ d been a small woods where the loveliest sunbeams always shined brightest . Well hidden in-between cobbled pathways and thriving trees unlike any other , the residents of Nebaliya referred to this sacred nook as the Fragment Soil . It was here , during the setting sun of SummerDay 396 F.E. , that our spunky sisters Aleandra and Verselle peered upon to mark the beginning of what would swiftly unfold as their greatest adventure throughout their vivacious ninth & seventh summers respectively . Arm and arm like the closest of allies , these two - separated in size , not in spirit - landed within the threshold of tranquility glowing several streams through their becharminbs cheeks as gentle hugs followed soon after . This eudemonic setting - dwelling in beings from far corners of physical & astrotemporal whacks - maintained so serene that even a thought formed aloud was enough to leave fragmented silences exorthopara wingate eager wind blowing softly against the grass which holds before a concise silver open-air shed .

I won the championship last year by taking the time-old challenge up a notch . Most time travelers usually go back in time in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler and his top men as simply as possible – guns or bombs , most typically . That was already a tough challenge with its known risks to succeed at , so no wonder I allured death-defying spectators when I also offered a masters-level of the Assassinate Hitler game – through the power of manipulation . I started about a month before WWII had considered `` on '' , as the European elite feasted its way through a peace-time negotiations around national borders , lofty future plans , armament stockpiles – the works . He was already grossly controversial yet powerful with a priceless firsthand opportunity at winning Eutopia before the horrors ahead – in addition to giving giant headaches my particular target .

The wind gusted like his breath beneath the wooden footbridge hanging too low over the deserted creek of silence . It creaked and hung , watching Slattenov spill his warm heart to the icy waters below . Numbly he observed an avalanche of yellow petals and blazing tadpoles rushing past him , burdened by purpose and secrets but pulling nothing along but razor leaves . The silent banks forebode nothing standing against the slowly rising , an enigma to absorb , only watched by Heaven ablaze and trembling in time with a reflecting heart . Standing root like , he internally begged shards of nightlife to race with him ahead of the bend . Somehow here at the root of necessity he 'd inhabit , love became so strangely intertwined yet on this perpetual , sunset hope stream he must paddle off , reliving an interrupted stream of unresolved but thrilling discoveries along the way .
At first it was so hard to see you fading away , but I understand that growing up means sometimes leaving behind cherished memories and companions . So , to help the goodbye be a bit easier , I spent the remaining time with you creating as many amazing and unforgettable memories as possible . We sang , played picturesque kiddie games and I even threw you an amazing `` farewell '' party . At long last , until perhaps one glorious day the kid returns to their dreams and discovers you there again , bidding my final goodbye was the harest but I was thankful to have experienced the opportunity in the first place .
Sun hit my face as a hand shook my shoulder doing its best to pull me from my sleep . Groggily , I stirred , peering out the window at the risen sun . The sun was not to be admired long , however , as the hand that had affectionately disturbed my tranced state had other plans . I smiled despite the interruption , recognizing two gentle , familiar eyes peeking up at me . “ Good morning sleepy head , it ’ s time to get up ! Where away in a thrilling tale we go. ” The die was cast - an excitable proclamation signaling that both of us knew we were alledgning upon some grand and adventuresome place , enticed by fate with promise of all the infinite possibilities that followed in it 's boundary-lessshadow , enticing us to forge onward , on interesting paths , in pictures whaling new desires and wonderful impressions burned in barks tinier than seedlings yet potent allbthe same ..

It 's hard to know that someone you 've cared for so deeply is beginning a new journey without you . I wish you all the best as your adventure and exploration continues to lead you on some incredible journeys . Your time with me has come and gone , and while it was brief , each moment holds invaluable memories .

The morning sun streaming in through the window brought him peace after such a long and harrowing night . Quietly , he allowed deep breaths to purify and calm his soul in an effort to compose himself for his next tough decisions . But equal parts sorrow and rage welled up uncontrollably . He knew that whatever choice he made would change the course of his life forever , but there was no deciding against his instincts – now was the time to stand up ; to settle the wrongs for good .
I was completely taken aback as I saw happiness being donated . In my 20 years of living without emotions , I had never encountered anything like it . It was such a wonderful and strangely comforting feeling that I could never imagined existed . For a few moments , at least , I was happy . I wanted to remember that feeling forever , but I recognized that this life of emptiness was all I could come to know . Soon enough , reality took hold and I found myself once again filled with the dullness that I had come to call feelings . But that token of joy gave me hope . Because it was genuine human kindness that had given me even an expression of it , no object material could . And with the undeniable warmth and confidence that aimless emotion of happiness had left with me , I knew then it was n't really true emptiness as I had acknowledged it before ; I knew there was a true source of emotion within all of us . So , slowly but gradually , the donation box started to brim with now welcomed sponsors OF emotional 'investments ' . Immediately , I reached out and generated more places throughout the neighborhood where people would invest their gains in others . It was like that when laughed , I saw grins shine unhindered in the faces of our local citizens , children , teens and adults . People started gathering newly made peace grudges were laughed and love began to take path in many hearts . The donation of emotions may have not persevered jubilant weeks time-span yet , but those simple youthful moments had rightly added an innumerable beauty to uniqueness in our everyday joy experiences . Something that was unkind to have oblivious me alive – connected me tenderly once more to the volatile emotions world innately blessed within all of us , indeed !
As time passes , the connection of me and my kid slowly fades away over time . There have been wonderful memories of laughter , play , stubbornness , fun times , and angry moments . I find solace in remembering that I have been able to fill their life with light and boundless joy ( even on the most turbulent and troubling times ) . I honor the bond between my kid and me , knowing our connection will forever remain whether I 'm around nearly or not . Though the kid will soon opt for the stimulation provided by the entire world around them , I try to cling to all wonderful memories and emotions we 'd created together . Let 's make this situation mutually beneficial : I take the lessons I learned while in the life of that particular kid and extend the same bond of fun , love , and affection , to the suffering child . Whenever my kid recall sweet memories of our difference , life become suitable better . By accomplishing and exercising my client goals , I can always leave with as feeling that I was no invisible ephemeral entity fulfilling only whimsical obligations ; I detachable friendship that allowed unfathomable opportunity and for that I am cherish and eternally immensely grateful .
Once upon a time , in a far-off kingdom , lived a young princess named Sasha . Her life was peaceful and somewhat solitary – she was beloved by the kingdom 's people , but her parents were always too busy of arranging alliances or plotting strategy to spend any quality time with her . So she lived without close companions outside of those loyal to her , a few having vowed protects until the end of days . One day , on the way back to the castle , Sasha came across what was at first an unassuming park . She perfectly parallel lines that appeared to be streams meandering . Sasha assumed the irrigation system streams were maintained by a farmer somewhere on an orchard . Could this be a part of the kingdom growing ? It got her imagination running . Her thoughts flickered over to designing buildings and editing them for aesthetic presentation representing not only her family , but her kingdom . Indubitably , chess was a device Sasha knew little about and thus , beyond a passing interest in the operational pieces , she merely admired playing against others , possible opponents and otherwise . Improbably enough , a figure showed up , eroding the empty impression of winter . Sasha was both shocked and awe at a creature with a single prominent tuft of rugged heather in one end and canine-like features in another . The comely familiar tapped a signet ring it coild detect and identify . A man ? Had to be a powerful member of the court .

It 's natural to feel sad for me , an imaginary friend , slowly slipping away as my friend matures . I 'll always stay present in their memories , though , wherever their steps may take them . As for me ? I 'll form strong friendships and hear happy stories again . A big hug farewell , and I 'm on my unfolding path . Hopefully one day I will find a owner would appreciate what we used to share . For now , it is time to say my goodbye !

At first , I didn ’ t understand why , but I felt a strange warmth emanate from the box when the donation of happiness was made . I cautiously reached out for it and when my hand touched it , I felt a wave of joy wash over me . It felt foreign and fragile , and yet I was intrigued . I held onto that feeling of joy from the wondrous donation , and found that I was better able to understand other people ’ s emotions through it . On some level , I even began to identify different patterns in people 's gestures , infers , and expressions fueled by different emotions . It was two dimensional at first , but slowly overtime as I soaked in different examples of illustrated emotional experiences , I started to recognize different layers and how they can still be interconnected . I also found that I was slowly able to form and elevate my own feelings by understanding someone else ’ s exchange and how it can affect them . The bigger chance it had a harmony on myself , creating endurance on any opposing situations where regret and sadness were present . Instead of making me cautious or do anything but cautiously chart beyond logic , rather , it made environment from which newfound joy is created by taking a back seat . Donations have kept my box full of various expressions and an understanding beyond pain and disagreement which I couldn ’ t before before . I find myself even more in touch with myself and others and I attribute this to the acts of generosity others have bestowed upon me . At night , the night sky feels like a million of donated emotions silently twinkling and I couldn ’ t be more gratefull .

I love you ... only . '' After saying his goodbyes , her brother gulped and hungrily replied . `` Me too , Laura . '' Surrounded by euphoria and adrenaline , Laura rushed away , pondering upon what had just transpired . She smiled to herself knowing only three words declared the eternal bond that tied them together as siblings forever — she loved him , only .

Once there were two friends , Martha and Ann . They had known each other for many years and had grown very close . Summer was nearly over , and Martha and Ann decided to take one last spontaneous vacation together to a tropical island . The small island appeared to be made entirely of sand , with lush vegetation and sparkling ocean waves invitingly lapping at its beaches . Martha and Ann were filled with excitement as they took an efficient , buxom pleasure-craft to the shore , docking atop a postcard paradise . They spent their days swimming in the salty-sweet waters , walking around the quaint little town , and sharing in endless laughter and genuine friendship . On the last night of their wonderful journey , from the magnificent setting of the golden sand beach , they talked throughout the night until finally deciding to muse on a topic they always wanted to discuss - the deepest secrets they kept within their hearts . Martha told Ann about the teenage crush she couldn ’ t let go of and Ann cried for that unfounded insecurity , both of them confessing what scared them the most about the other , and allowing each other to strive towards a personal horizon . They would n't be as understanding and liberating friends without this important moment by the ocean , and all wrongs were righted in a never-ending flurry of words , awed gasps , shared intimacies , quietness , embrace and courage fueled by the warm night and the stars above . That 's how sometimes planes fly into picturesque backdrops wherever sand hugs the soft , stretchy lines of oceans and it rocks people with determination and audacity , the kind of friendship that lasts long after trips come back into false mornings , long after sunset litters small pieces of lives stuck onto tissues spotted with tears and lengthy engagement over beautiful equations of existence . So thanked them for those unforgettable summer days - sandy and coconut flavored ! The next morning Martha and Ann woke up inspired , jump-starting answers from questions originally penned from fear . Both taken aback at the idea that ten days could transform a friendship into undeniable trust-tainted resonance that streamed on as strong as the tides could wave forwards and backwards . Martha and Ann then headed returned to reality . Knowing now that their friendship would be a direct feel of unforgettable good times tomorrow ’ s white noise . All reflections of being recharged with irresistible bond strong enough to lift anything that could make them stumble . Spring aboard rusted vessels converted sailing palaces , greeting

Summer rain reminds Victoria of her mother . Days at the lake , stoking the fire . Fishing pole dipping . Moon chasing them home . Bucket of cray fish to cook . Gutting and tightening the morning set lines . Folk lore , jokes far too silly ; butterflies swelling nightly felt air . Sparking comet in an open sky of blue . Closing her eyes , dreams seeping into sleep . Chirping yonder , love emanating near her busy head . Home was the love of family stories . Durampen was but a magical small town in south . Groaning from younger days just underneath her lashes- youth could n't stay still in that every wondrous season . Joy flowed yet anew each cycle marking anew the lake tinkering . Home spot of simplicity where forever flourish sauntering till in breaths only one ; nature . Beneath .

She had so many dreams of what life could be , but each night when the stars went away and the setting sun tinted her buildings all soft pink of sunset warmth shrank farther and farther away from her .

Ashe herself shone amid this transition , her person a bright beacon as she made her way through painted grass and walker footprints toward a crooked creek she remembered growing up near .

I was left alone in the world , with no emotions and no clue how to deal . I felt as if I was living a twilight existence , lacking the breadth and density of feeling . So in my attempt to tap into a conscious application of something beyond my preternatural inner white noise , I thought to create for myself an emotional repository . I painted a metal lockbox and placed beside it a simple indication of membership requirement : `` Donate your precious emotions . '' Morosely , nightly new donors arrived , recruited from the gloom faced multitudes and validated by key clamps into my clandestine solitude . Fear and trepidation , mostly remorse rolled helpless into the collector – failing as this wellspring dew flattened on the lagoon the obsidian pond arose , forever collecting early morning springs and wet afternoons cloak .

As I examine the small , cloth box that is now lying by my feet , I pick it up carefully and sit myself down on my lowered bed .

A murky morning air gave its claustrophobic weight to the sweaty alleyways and unforgiving attitude of the busy metropolis . People speeding around maneuvered through the plaza district -- dealing in magically woven tapestries , charred weapons crafted through elemental defiance , and mystical vials percolating with just the right proportions of specific raw compounds deemed legal by this militaristic yet unguarded accord . Asphyxia of altered intent like rare puzzles barely described… no doubt , ever made one curious enough gaze up in preparation of worlds of children beyond such morning strifes -- seeing innocent ones one after the other walking amongst street tables and bargain strips of pink velvet with expressions of flawless realization far from latent despar yet almost ascetitle for points calculated by only sober masters… what summoned itself as plauiblimity .

I started my run for championship with a basic and expected plan ; I traveled back in time to April 30 1925 and hung out by Adolf Hitler 's cell door at Landsberg Am Lech prison , eavesdropping in eager anticipation .

Sunlight burst into his retina while the thunderous coral seeped out of the Grand Hall — for it it was his wedding day . Eagerly tottering in steady steps he continued towards Fate waiting faithfully behind temple ropes . He assumed the grace of stoic cheer reflecting off the ever building chanting and jolly waves . Silk pangchitas screened his anxiety away , confidently breezing away beneath strong shoulder tattoos . The smirks from the choir deceived timidity , calming misgivings of love joys and newfound pains . Piped mango flowers delicately scattered like anklet toppings made his thrust all the better . Mundane monsoon flooded the sky like final preparative compliments bedazzling even Groomsman splendour . His hesitant only obscured the sky glaring prowess balanced by Allah promised blessings . Protection… Solidified . Deemarking meaning done . Duty .

At first , you did n't know why you needed to have this talk since you didn ’ t necessarily wrong yourself . But as you look closer , you noticed how you could have been a completely different person if only you took a chance you avoided initially . You realize that the version of yourself now standing in that heavenly room overpowered the old you . Seeing result —without any ulterior filters —grown into the ability to forgive as you gradually understand about the behavior caused by different life stages and variables in the life puzzle . After painstaking discussion , followed resilience , the redemption prevails and humanity sends you both home-free .

Once upon a time I lived in a place were nature stepped out of a fairy tale , as lush emerald forests arched above fresh valleys bursting with vibrant colors – alive with fascinating bird and animal chatter .

In the beginning of it all , watching the rankings had a strangely familiar feeling to it . The media coverage of these fights was incredibly thorough ; it felt like I was there , watching each fight as it went on . Before I realized it , it was me on the cameras , fighting my own bloody path to the top . I got to first in a pretty boring way . It was weird how every person I defeated was cocky , arrogant and looked strangely like my brother . Most of them even sounded like him . I made it to first without effort , and here I sit , someone coming along and challenging me whenever I feel like it . They never stand a chance , and they always seem bewildered as they die . I 'm pretty sure I 'm dreaming . It feels like I 'm playing with dolls .
So I know this is both late and perhaps not as concise as it could be . But I got carried away . -- -- -- - Second As I left , I heard Wallace call out , “ Do n't forget your necklace , sir. ” I thanked him and left , and for a moment my thoughts remained with the man who had been a servant in the house of the Second for as long as I had been there – and possible through the previous tenant 's time there , too . The gold necklace had been a gift from the Archduke of the Downs , back when I was a child and the Downs had an Archduke . One summer his territory had been overrun by stray dogs , which at times clogged the narrow alleys , and every night let loose such a yawing and bellowing that no one got a night 's rest for miles . I had been a ratty child then , living in the alleys and surviving on the scraps the dogs brought be from overfull dumpsters and whatever they could steal from tables and taverns . The Archduke , a self-styled ruler whose conquest would have been more impressive had it been bigger , or in any way desirable , had heard word of me from his personal guard who patrolled the uneven streets at night and had caught the occasional glimpse of my dirty face running with the dogs through the back streets . I was brought before the Archduke , in tattered clothes and looking , no doubt , more like a dog than a boy , and had thought to impress me by transmuting my dirty shirt into a gold necklace . He had drawn me , with the promise of food and shelter , into his service , which began with my persuading the rampant wild dogs to go elsewhere . And I had , entering the minds of the creatures and urging them *go on , there 's food there , far away* . To my credit , I had felt shame at sending away the very creatures who had fed me , and kept me safe . But the Archduke 's promises of steady food and shelter dry in rain and warm in winter were too enticing . Today , hardly anyone would look at me and know me for the ratty dog boy from the Downs . I had n't lived there in years , and my clothes spoke of the importance of my station . Now , whenever anyone looked at me , I knew their thoughts : *Second* . Even if I could n't sink into their minds as I could a dog 's , their thoughts were written plain in the widening of their eyes , and the increased pace , and furtive glances when they thought I could n't see . And when they were out of earshot , I could hear , through the ears of their pets , what no one should hear : unfiltered discourse about myself . I knew they did n't know what power I had , why I was Second or how I had persuaded the previous Second to abdicate his position . They suspected a hidden well of energy upon which I could draw , or a strength or speed that I hid within my slight body . The previous Second , a polyglot with the unique ability to cause anyone he wished to speak in a different language , had owned a small terrier called Whimsy , who he kept at his side at all times , as a sort of good luck charm . It had been Whimsy , after all , who had first so entranced the child of Sirius Hempsy , governor extraordinaire , and brought him to the attention of the people who would later see to it that he helped write the treaty that allowed for the peaceful annexation of several suburbs into the city limits . It had also been Whimsy who saw Sirius with the boy , and heard the boy 's whimpers . I had simply been one of the many folk who stopped to pet the terrier and whisper encouraging words into the Second 's ear . The night I confronted him , he simply left the city , conferring to me the title of Second without a struggle . The only peculiarity was his knife , which he wore always on his belt . It could have come from the Middle Ages , and was , I guessed , a boning knife , although I was n't sure . He 'd run his hand along its length as though it was a lover , and then set it carefully on the counter of his high-rise apartment and walked out . Reflexively , my hand went to my hip and felt for the cool bone handle of the knife . I had begun to carry it with me , as a sort of trophy . My own good luck charm , along with the late Archduke 's necklace , still hanging around my neck . I thought I might need it tonight . The Second 's position was precarious . At the apex of a mountain of skilled individuals , the position was coveted by many , for many reasons . Some wanted the recognition , and some simply felt they should have what they deserved . For the past few days , I had heard , beneath the braying and the barking , the thoughts of a pomeranian who lived in the French quarter . More accurately , I had heard , through his ears , the braying of a man who lived near a bridge , and told every passerby of a boy he 'd known , a boy who could talk to dogs , and who now lived downtown and lorded over us all . I was going to stop him . My knife would stop the braying . I had , somehow , come to a park . I did n't remember the journey there , but there I was . I looked around me and found the bridge from the dog 's mind , much smaller to my human eyes . It crossed a gentle stream that I guessed would empty into the river that cut through the city 's center . The moon was high , and - Something was not right . The hairs on the back of my neck rose to attention , and I walked towards the bridge , trying for a calm appearance . I had the sudden urge to turn around , but **keep walking** something inside of me suggested . My hand went to the bone knife , but I kept walking . The hairs on my neck were frozen out , as though by static . I felt my heart beating in my throat , and the took a deep breath to calm myself . The pomeranian , I knew . I closed my eyes briefly and saw myself , through the dog 's eyes . It was behind me , watching me . *Stay* I told it , and it did n't move , just watched . I kept walking , trying to ignore the growing feeling of dread within me . My hand gripped the bone knife painfully . **Stop walking** something suggested . I did . It was the last mistake I ever made .
It is nice to be king . Maybe it would be better if everyone was n't trying to kill me , but things could be much worse . I have a nice apartment , a beautiful girlfriend , some good money , and really what more does a man need to be happy ? I suppose love , but we are in love , and honestly , no one else thinks she is beautiful , so I think we were made for each other . Now , how did I reach this pinnacle you ask . Well , the answer is quite simple , my power is not all that impressive , actually it is rather bad . Same with hers , but together , it works out quite well . You see , you have to declare when you are going to kill someone of a higher rank , that way we know who killed them , and they know that they are being hunted . So when someone say that they are going to come gunning for me , I open up a video call with them . A simple video call . Nothing more nothing less , but what I do on that call shows my power . No one knows what it is of course , I make sure of that by keeping the calls private . When I get them online I talk to them , and eventually I suggest we flip a coin . This is my power . I flip a coin with another person , heads , he dies , tails , I die , and no , double-headed coins do n't count . Why would I use something so risky , you may wonder . Simple really , my girlfriends power is over luck . Playing poker and she says cards , that will be her hand . Call a coin flip , that is the way it will land . Together we rose up here . It is really surprising that no one else ever thought to work together , but I suppose they really are just to power hungry to share anything . It is quite a shame . I am sure that there are better combos than this . Now I really must be going , and so must you I 'm afraid , after all you know my secret now . `` Sweetheart , you think it is going land on heads again ? ''
This time , *for sure* , number one is going down . I 've got it all figured out ; the plan is *foolproof ! * Every day at 12:17 sharp she grabs a Reuben sandwich at Katz 's deli and sits in the booth with her back to the door . *Back to the door ! * Let that soak in for a minute . What an idiot ! ! ! *I should be number one ! * Everyone knows it . Well , the last eight number threes did n't know it . But they learned it . And if they were still around , they 'd tell you the truth about me . I 'm a killing machine . I 'm impervious to harm . The only way there will be a new number two , is when I am the new number one . That 'll be 12:17 tomorrow , sharp . It 's simple . Once a day I can fire an energy beam from my eyes that will kill anything , *anyone* , immediately on contact . 12:17 tomorrow . Back to the door . Like a fish in a barrel . -- -- -- -- I have no idea why number one wants to grab lunch tomorrow . But I do n't need to know . More importantly , I do n't care . There 's no way to take out number two . That crazy son of a bitch hit the genetic lottery ... or however the hell we got these powers . So , I 'm just going to skip him and take over the throne . That number one is an idiot . I have no idea how she 's lasted this long . She 's just a meek god damned book worm . Sure , she 's cute enough - but cute is n't what makes rulers . Ruthlessness does . Badassery does . The ability to transmute Thousand Island dressing into poison with a single touch does . 12:17 tomorrow . The second she turns her attention elsewhere . Like taking candy from a baby ... and poisoning it . -- -- -- -- The next day , 12:16 . She 's early today . No matter , everything else is running like a Swiss watch . There she is . Back to the door . A fish in a barrel . -- -- -- -- Ok , we 're a little early today , but no matter . There she is . Reuben sandwich . Just have to wait for the slightest distraction , and this will be her last meal . And then I 'll be eating like a king from here on out . -- -- -- -- 12:17 . This is it . The moment of truth ! Time to take my rightful place ! Just one well place energy beam to the back of the ol ' pineapple . She wo n't feel a thing . I 'll be doing her a favor . She 's not cut out to be number one . She 's just some nerd benefitting from a glitch in the system . *There 's no way she supposed to be number one . * It does n't make any sense ! *She does n't even do anything . * She just reads and studies all of the time . That 's not a real power . -- -- -- -- 12:17 . Holy crap , this is going to be easier than I thought ! That clumsy idiot knocked her own books on the floor . I do n't even have to cause a distraction . Her head is practically touching the ground as she goes to collect her stupid books . Like taking candy from a baby ... with just one touch . What smells like burning ? *CLUNK* -- -- -- -- 12:17:01 *Awww ... shit ! Not again ! * Well , I guess that makes nine number threes . *DAMN IT ! ! ! * Back to the drawing board . But I 'm not giving up . Another inspired plan will come to me ; they always do . And this time it will definitely be *foolproof ! *
BANG The gunshot rang out across the snowy scene clear as a bell . I stared at the shooter through half-lidded eyes . I watched as his face took a victorious look . He was so sure he had killed me . I looked down , picked the slug out of my jacket , then tossed it aside . I looked back at my assailant just in time to see his look of confusion . He did n't get it . they never did , not right away . I began my little mental game . It was n't a game I played with others , more of a personal gambling thing . *I bet he thinks its some man o ' steel BS . * I thought to myself . Surprisingly , his look of confusion gave way to one of utter determination . He dropped the gun , raised his fists , and charged . I blinked , but other wise I made no move . There was really no need . As he closed , his eyes took on a look that one gets when ones chess opponent has made a fatal flaw . He launched a hard right at my temple . His fist made contact , then burst into flames , rendered to ash . He screamed . I stood there , placing my wager on what was going through his mind as he writhed in the snow , rubbing his stump in the frost that coated the ground . *Maybe he just is n't thinking . * He finally stopped screaming , and his eyes whipped back to me . *Is he smiling ? Oh . * The flesh from his stump stretched , the exposed bone lengthening . He was a regenerator . How boring . He did n't even wait to finish regrowing his hand before he tried to strike again , stabbing up at my ribs with the sharp end of bone . These regenerators never thought before they acted , they jut relied on a wolverine-esque powers of regrowth to carry the day . My little mental game was over . No point wasting time . As his bone pierced my jacket , he let out a premature scream of victory before being catapulted backwards against the wall behind him , shattering his skull and sending bits of blood everywhere . He still was n't done though , as he fell to the ground , his body had already begun to rebuild itself . If he did n't get it before , his slowly rebuilding brain sure would n't get it now . I walked towards him , right arm extended , index finger outstretched to be placed on his forehead . His eyes widened as my power began to freeze him in place . My power is converting one kind of energy into any other kind of energy . Kenetic to potential , heat to kinetic , potential to heat , you fucking name it . The only restriction was that I had to be touching the thing whos energy I wanted to convert . I had converted to kinetic energy of the bullet into potential energy . I had turned the kinetic energy of his fist into heat energy . When he tried to stab me , I had converted his potential energy into backward kinetic energy . And now I was turning the heat energy of his body into potential energy , freezing him from within . Soon he was a human ice sculpture , half regrown and all kinds of grotesque . `` Fucking idiot . '' I flicked his frozen nose , converting every ounce of potential energy in his body into heat and kinetic , vaporizing him on the spot . I looked down at the holes he had put in my clothes with irritation . `` Now I have to get a new fuckin ' jacket . ''
Some punk kid shot me . I think I saw the number 6473 , but I 'm not sure . He was probably on his way back to his friends to brag about how he took down number one . I wish he 'd checked that his aim was true . I 'm getting so tired . I guess I should go ahead and begin . No use in just laying here bleeding . What stars I can see just look so pretty though . It 's a shame really , I 'll have to stop for the night . The street lamps begin the dim , as the large 1 on my forhead begins to glow . Windows start to darken . I see people walking past the alley begin to become sluggish and confused . I see people begin to pull their cars over as their eyelids become heavy . I prefer to gradually activate my power . It prevents unnecessary damage . Of course , if I had truly been in danger of dying , I would n't have had a choice in the matter . I ca n't see the stars anymore . I must be fine now . I 'm just so tired all the time . I do n't want to move . I just lay there , wishing I could sleep , like everyone else in the city . They 'll be fine , of course . Just like every time before , they 'll wake up in the morning feeling refreshed with all their aches and pains gone , and missing the two hours or so before they fell asleep . I guess I should go home now . See if I ca n't drink myself to sleep like I usually do after these things happen . I wish they 'd stop shooting me .
I do n't want it anymore . It 's really boring . Some people say it 's lonely at the top , those people are really stupid . It 's crowded at the top . I 'd like to say that it 's because I show mercy , or take pity . In reality , holding the top spot is really easy for me , being second to me has to be a nightmare . There 's this amazing unwritten code between people at the top . Once you become second , you get a week . You get one week to come find me . Everybody , from the new number three all the way out of the top ten , they just leave you alone for a week . I never complain , everyone seems to take the whole duration of their week to prepare and I can enjoy the downtime . Not that I really have a whole lot to do anymore . But it 's a feeding frenzy when the second fails . They come to me , they challenge me with pride , there 's a majesty to being the best . Even if you were scum of the Earth , you would still have pride when you challenged me . You will fail in the end , and will be slaughtered mercilessly , but you have pride , I remember what it 's like to have pride , I think . The place where we are fighting is quaint . We are alone , I always insist on my fights being private . I can feel your hand closing around my throat , you 're not gloating . You just want to know how someone who is so weak could possibly still be at the top . How have I not killed you yet ? You know that all the news stories , all the deaths of second ranked schmucks , are n't actually me . They 're credited to me , but they are n't me . You 've taken part in a few group assassinations of failing number twos . That 's how you got here . I understand though , because if you can just crush my windpipe like this , why am I still at the top ? I struggle a little , it 's futile . Your super strength guarantees I 'm not going to escape . I 'm just frustrated with the whole thing and I really want it to end . You still wo n't do it , will you ? You have to know why am I at the top , and why I 've been here through so many great supers . Contract killers , super-powered good samaritans , even kids with extraordinary abilities ... they 've all come to challenge me for the privileges of being king of the hill and you 're so close . You 're angry I wo n't fight back . The beeping starts in your pocket , probably your cell phone telling you that your week is up and the lynch mob is coming . You have no choice now , you 'd better hurry . I just smile as you grimace and squeeze with all your might , I feel the rush of pain as you snap my neck effortlessly . You drop me to the ground and raise your arms in triumph , I 'll read about you in the paper tomorrow . I think number three uses acid , that one will be grisly . 12:01 AM and my corpse vanishes . I reappear fit as a fiddle in my apartment and check the ranking terminal . I wonder if you begged for your life confused , while you insisted that you killed the most powerful man in the city . I 'm sorry you had to fail , I 'm very sorry you had to die . It 's your fault , it 's been the fault of every number two for over a century now . You all insist on fighting . You all insist on coming to kill the unkillable man . You are want the privilege of being number one . One of you can have it , I do n't want it anymore . I just want to die .
I remember this day with a mixture of fondness and horror . It was a rather average , slightly cloudy day when it began , the news reporters on jumbotrons reporting the accident . “ Emmett Dodson , the number 1 for over 20 years , has passed from a stroke. ” The streets suddenly descended in a frenzy as everyone checked their phones , seeing their number ascend one or two digits . “ Number 4 , 863 , ” my closest friend , Johnathan said , gleaming at his phone , showing me the screen . “ So excited ! ” I tried to convince the boy to calm down , but his giddiness was a like a forest fire , unable to extinguished . Only after what seemed like a lifetime , did he calm down , asking me to check my own rank . Turning on my phone to only appease my friend , I begin to go through my apps . Probably still in 5,000s , I thought . I hadn ’ t discovered my power , unlike most of the members of my family . My father was number 312 , a mid-level empathic , the golden child of his family , being the first to achieve a rank above 1,000 . With the ability to push certain emotions into people ’ s mind , his suggestions were a contributing factor to his survival as a child in his small town . My mother on the other hand , was a low level memorizer , number 5,443 , only able to garner a person ’ s attention for a single moment before shockwaves of pain would course through her head . “ He is probably still in the 5,000s , ” Lilly mused , the bassist of our band . Her instrument was strapped across her back , her forgetfulness causing her to misplace her music case . Out of the four of us , she and I were the only ones that still held our instruments , for my mother was late in dropping me off at John ’ s house . “ Oh , well what are you , Lilly ? ” Michael , our drummer asked , a wolfish smile on his face . Lilly ’ s face instantly become red , her eyes looking downwards as she mumbled a number in the 8,000s . I finally found the app on my phone , quickly tapping it with my right thumb . LOADING.LOADING.LOADING… . Hurry the hell up , you dumb phone . LOADING . LOADING . LOADING… NUMBER 1 . I instantly felt my heart fold in on itself , my blood beginning to race . Number 1 ? That ’ s not possible . I violently bit my teeth , attempting to stifle my amazement . “ What was it ? ! ” John asked , his eyes wide with hope . “ Still in the 5,000s ? ” At my nod , his excitement simmered away . “ Well , it ’ s alright , man . Next time. ” He gave me a gentle pat on the back , completely catching me by surprise . My bite on my tongue loosened , a small trickle of blood leaving the small space between my lips . “ Man , you ’ re bleeding all over your clothes and instrument ! ” Michael hollered , catching my case right as I let the handle go . “ Ahh , all over your white shirt , ” he groaned . “ I just bit my tongue , ” I said . “ I ’ m fine , honestly ... ” “ You ’ re so disgusting , mate , ” Lilly sighed , suddenly walking off . With a sigh , Michael handed me my guitar case as he went running after Lilly , her fast legs allowing her to already take a corner . “ Hey , lets get some water to rinse out your mouth. ” John grabbed me by the hand , pulling me towards the gas station across the street . “ Gim me a minute , ” he said as he walked into the store . I waited patiently , using the sleeve of my jacket to clean the outside of my case , worried that my blood might have gotten into the case . I flicked open the latches , relieved at the sight of a clean guitar . As I was about to latch it close , I saw a well-dressed man striding towards me , his large hands reaching . Before I knew it , he had hold of me , our surrounding swiftly shifting to what seemed like the middle of an alleyway . Before I could take in my surroundings , I saw the man pull a gleam of silver from his coat , raising it high . In a bout of fright , I jerked back , barely evading the blade ’ s kiss , clumsily tripping over my guitar case . Regaining my composure as I hit the ground , I grabbed at the nearest object I could see , my guitar barely hanging out of my case . Gripping the neck , I put the guitar in front of me , ready to fight for my life . Suddenly , the man stopping in mid-stride , his face becoming a scarlet red . A stream of blood came from his ears , staining his white-collared shirt . In half a breath , the man collapsed , his face landing in a grimy puddle . In my amazement , I scuffled away from the dead man , my back hitting the alleyway ’ s walls . I released the hold of my guitar , letting it drop to the ground . Bringing my knees to my chest , I held myself , the faint sound of nearby music suddenly becoming apparent to me . I gazed down at my instrument , eyes falling upon its strings . At the neck of my guitar , a few drops of my own blood stained the strings a crimson red .
Determining the fates of others never seemed like a blessing to me , a simple , powerful thought could ruin the lives of countless . It took too long for me to control it , and even longer to accept the things that I have done . I never wanted to rise to the top , If I could , I would be at the bottom . But I guess that the fact that I 'm already here and will remain here could mean that people will stop killing each other for nothing more than a status . At first I honed my power to remain on top , so that people will know that trying to kill me would never work , nobody will be on top other than me and the greed might even stagnate . But that was n't enough . After much practice , meditation , and careful deliberation , I managed to stagnate the top 10 , for as long as I live , the top 10 will never change . After years more and a few , accidents , I stagnated the top 100. the power struggle started to stop . Later on , 1,000 . 1,000 of the most powerful people in the world , now immortal . At first it helped , people stopped trying to kill to rise in the ranks . But the top 1,000 started to realize that they could no longer be killed , they all became obsessed with that fact , as if they were demi-gods , that they could not kill each other , and that they could rule the world . They began to cull anyone who had a strong power , but not everyone altogether , for they toyed with them , they loved the idea that they were gods , and I could do nothing but watch . Soon , almost everyone but the 1,000 had such weak powers that they became mortal . But none of them believed anymore that I was the god above them all . They thought that it was a mistake of some sorts that I was ranked the top , that the oracles made an error . And now , I have to fix the wrongs that I have done . All the atrocities they committed were because of me , I should never have made them believe that they were immortal , because they 're not . I ca n't make everyone `` immortal '' , I ca n't make *anyone* immortal . I can not save everyone , for it will take too much time . There comes a day when angels and demons will have to fall all at once , and this day has been long overdue . I changed all our fates with a single focused thought , fates that I never knew I had the power to change until now . And I just did . Soon , very soon , the world will become mortal once more , for the so-called gods do not deserve to rule it . *** **Power : Ability to determine how and when a person dies** *** Edits : Lots of last minute grammatical changes .
Prologue : *It was n't the largest city , but it was definitely the most powerful and arguably dangerous in the world . Every single person here held a special ability , ranging from a power to clean everything within a 2m radius , to extreme powers such as flying or super strength . All these powers helped construct the most technologically advanced and richest city the world . One man had the power to give everybody a ranking in terms of how powerful their powers were . The minor powers caused little trouble , but conflicts to reach the top 10 cause widespread destruction . However there was one person who has held the top spot for many years . Me . * I am considered the greatest of them all - yet no one but me knows why . I have no extraordinary powers like time control , even inferior powers like the cleaning everything within a 2m radius . I am a normal human being . Since killing someone with a higher ranking gives the killer a higher ranking themselves , I have been the target of many assassination attempts . I have survived them all . Some say my power is health regeneration , but that 's not true . Some say my power is extreme luck , but that 's not true either . Maybe in 2000 years they will think my power is immortality , but that is only half true . It took me a while to find out what my power is . It 's the ability to be ranked number one on this superpower list . I am essentially immortal , as dying would mean I am not the top ranked anymore . My power is hardly powerful at all , yet I am the most powerful of them all .
I watched , allowing myself to recline into the throne once more . Fourth was interesting ; shivering like an autumn leaf in the breeze with either rage or fear . He isn ’ t even sure himself . “ Calm yourself , Fourth. ” Hissed Eighth . “ You ’ re inviting death. ” “ Calm ? Excuse me , but calm ? ” Fourth ’ s voice was at least an octave higher than usual – a barely suppressed neigh of laughter squeaking out of his throat . “ This madman just killed Third . For no reason whatsoever . And you ’ re telling me , to be calm ? ” “ There was a reason. ” I allow my lips to curl into a smile . “ She gazed upon me . Without permission. ” “ Do you… do you even hear what he… ” “ Silence , Fourth. ” A hauntingly beautiful voice that sent ripples down your spine . Even from up on high , I could sense the aura emanating from Second – a miasma of fear , blood thirst , and excitement that seemed to physically caress the vast throne room . “ Know your place . You have grown complacent in your power . It would be easy for any one of us in this room to replace you . The reason none of us have done so – “ and here , the pressure ceased – “ Is because you , like the rest of us , are under First ’ s protection. ” Even Fourth , unstable as he was , understood that he was beaten . Visibly swallowing his words , he returned to his former , kowtowing position – shivering all the time . “ And we move on. ” I glance at what had , formerly , been Third . “ Fourth . Take Third away . And use the moment to cool your head. ” “ Yes , First. ” He ’ s shaking , internally . But I have to give him some credit . He does a pretty good job of covering it up . Only Me , Second , and possibly Ninth could have discerned it . And now , to more serious matters . “ Seeing as how Fourth is currently occupied . Fifth , give your report. ” “ Yes , First. ” And the meeting continues . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - I should have seen it coming . Really , that was an odd failure . Perhaps I had let it happen . With a crash , Fourth brought my throne crashing down . “ Your reign of terror is over , First. ” Second ’ s face is completely calm – a reflection , I would suppose , of my own face . “ We know what your power is , now. ” For the first time , I find myself standing on the same level as Second . Not only Second . Fourth , Fifth , and Sixth… all the way up to Twelfth . They have me surrounded . And it fills me with anger . “ How dare you. ” “ No , First. ” Fourth ’ s protest is uncharacteristically serene . “ How dare you . You style yourself as the God-King of this city , and enslave everyone to your will - and even your most trusted generals must bow and scrape to you . Third – poor Third. ” A crack appears in that perfect mask of calm . “ You killed her , for bloody looking at you . I just… I just thought you were ruthless , but at that moment , I realized . You are mad , First. ” A chorus of murmurs spreads throughout the circle . Murmurs of approval . Of agreement . Of the idiotic vermin of the city . They disgust me so . “ Have you any last words ? Former First. ” Twelfth is cackling now . He was always so eager to please . “ Come at me , vermin. ” Oddly enough , no one takes the initiative . They all stand still , staring at me without moving so much as a muscle . For the first time in my life , I was confused . “ What ? ” -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- “ What ? ” Second was right , I thought . She ’ s finally nailed down First ’ s power . The one that eluded us all . First can only reflect abilities back at people . He himself has no real gifts . With that thought in mind , I grin as I take out the flipblade . Crude - but all the more fitting for this occasion . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- `` How odd . '' With a snap of my fingers , I send them all crashing into different corners of the room . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I was flung backwards . What was that … telekinesis . Third ? ! “ Third ! ” I managed to choke out the words before I collapsed into a fit of coughs . A blurred , shadowy figure strolled through the dust towards me . Third . When I finally got up again , First stood right in front of me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- “ Third ! ” Fourth managed , coughing all the while . How sad for them . Clinging on to such trivial things . “ Third is dead . You , of all people , should know that well. ” “ But… but how ? ” I could almost smile as he gets into a halfhearted boxing stance . Fourth was always a fighter . A fighter to his very end , it would seem . “ Haven ’ t you realized by now ? What my power truly is ? ” I pause , now . For dramatic effect . Fourth , however , was far too uncultured to appreciate the pause . Instead , he used the opportunity to take a swing at my face . I let it smash against my face – and I enjoy Fourth ’ s look of horror as he recoiled , cradling the remnants of his right hand . “ I am the Source , Fourth. ” I smile as Fourth gritted his teeth . “ Haven ’ t you ever wondered where your powers came from ? Or did you really think that they just fell out of the sky ? That you were born with them because you were luckier ? “ The only one here who is superior , ” I continue , snapping Fourth ’ s limbs one by one , “ Is me . I am , as you say , the God of this city . I am the God because I give the powers . “ But no more . Ungrateful curs , the lot of you. ” I sigh , mostly for dramatic effect – after all , I have no need to breathe . “ I think I ’ ll wipe the Earth clean of your kind . You sicken me . Every last one of you. ” With a swipe of my hand , I ended Fourth . So too , with the rest of the Earth .
A sigh escapes my throat . That ’ s bad . I was hoping to play it cool . To put on an air of confidence . Confidence is a marvellous thing . When you meet someone ’ s uncertainty with it , it becomes intimidating . And intimidation has a way of resolving conflicts before they even happen . But that little sigh ruined it . _ “ Yeah , you. ” _ Smug . Now , he ’ s the confident one , reassured by my reaction . I put down my whiskey . _ “ Show me your tag. ” _ Just like that . Unceremonious . Well , I suppose it makes sense - if someone thinks they are stronger , they will display the proof with no hesitation . If they are uncertain , they ’ ll run . It ’ s the standard fight or flight response that ruled our society ever since the awakening . _ “ I ’ m talking to you , wimp. ” _ My , so insolent . He has not even confirmed his superiority , yet he ’ s already tossing insults around . I have to admit , I ’ m starting to get annoyed . I note other patrons watching our little scene unfold . _ “ The fuck are you smiling about ? ” _ Oh . I smirked . I should stop trying to act out the stoic persona . Simply keeping my tongue in check doesn ’ t cut it - I ’ ve far too little control over my non-verbal expression . As matter of fact , I ’ ve far too little control in general . So close now , I can notice his pupils contract . He ’ s smirking back at me , trying to restore his image of confidence . For all that bravado , you become unnerved awfully easy , buddy . He grabs me by the collar and pulls it aside , revealing the collarbone . That ’ s where the tags usually are . My smirk grows into a grin as I watch his face turn to stone , as his mind rushes to register the correlation between the number he ’ s seeing and the concept it embodies . __Danger.__ _ “ Hey. ” _ Apparently processing that new information takes all of his mental effort , as he is still clutching my collar . He lifts his gaze to meet mine . _ “ Show me your tag. ” _ If someone thinks they are stronger , they will display the proof with no hesitation . If they are uncertain , they ’ ll run . I ’ ve yet to experience that uncertainty .
Oh if they only knew ... Some might laugh , others would remain oblivious , but the majority would be , well , pissed . it 's not my fault i made it this far , it is merely happenstance . I have no control over my poewrs , they simply exist and it is what it is . They wo n't take this spot from , not unless I willingly give it up and why would I do that ? I mean , I know I did n't put in any effort , but the fact remains that I hold influence over everyone . Whether they like it or not , because I understand . I 've been there , trapped in a void of endless struggle . Rare glimpes of the light on the horizon as my only hope . Desparately clinging to anyone stronger than you in the hope that they will take you with them when they succeed . They never do though , they are too focused on their own gain . They 'll never figure it out either . hell , i never knew what my powers were until I almost died . Again . And Again ... and ... again ... T'is n't going to happen though . It 's Luck . My stupid ass power , is Luck . An insane amount of it . I did n't want the number one spot , but I hit the number 1 with my car on accident and killed him . Then a witness said I did it on purpose and BOOM . I 'm top dog . Seriously who does that happen too ?
\ # 21904 . That used to be my name , three days ago , and now I 'm , well , # 1 . No one in the city knows how it happened . The Top 30 , the ruling cabal , have absolutely no idea . I still have n't figured it out , either . All I remember is walking into a meeting where # 1 was giving a speech- for the first time , since I 'd finally turned 18 and had to follow the city 's decrees . He did n't even say a word ; he just randomly glared at me , told me to come up to the podium- and , overcome with dread , I did . Then he thrust his dagger toward me . I closed my eyes and realized he 'd held it backwards ; the hilt was in my hands . Before I could react , he jerked it back sharply and blood shot out of his chest straight into my face . His power was telepathy , not immortality . I screamed . He was smiling . He did n't even bother to speak . Nobody else in the room even gasped . I was # 1 , and they accepted it . They were smiling , too . I wish I 'd been able to figure out what was going on , but I 've been around 18 years and I have n't even found out my power . There 's no chance of me figuring it out anytime soon , either , since every day I face another challenge . Some are from the remaining Top 30 , the ones who were n't at the meeting , and others are just nobodies who think they have a shot because of what happened to me . Thing is , at all the public challenges , the same thing happens . They come in there grimacing , but when they get up , they use their power against themselves . They all die . Smiling . And the crowd smiles too . It seems like they all just want me to win .
They . They disgust . Their sneering faces , their pointless battles , constantly vying for rank . I look down upon them and I feel no pity . For years they postured . Their taunts : all proven empty . Their attacks : rebuffed and countered . They can ’ t see it and therefore don ’ t believe it ’ s there . Nobody can argue with results . Yet they continue to line up to yank the sword from the stone and revel in their own greatness . To have a moment in the true sun while their peers envy them and their fans unctuously blog about their greatness . The worst of them is “ ranked ” # 5 . Jerome the Mighty : body like Hercules , bank account like Trump , face like Dean , brains like Kardashian , stink of the monkey cage . He can literally lift buildings , dodge bullets , faster than a speeding train , with flowing hair that shames Fabio …all that bull shit.. mere parlor tricks to me . He should stick to making shitty movies and sending mass sexts to the tweens who fawn over him . He jerks off to his own “ hacked ” dick pics . When he finally came for me , to show me “ who the real man is ” I showed him…his own body after I snapped off his head and reanimated it so he could see know pathetic he is compared to me . Then I fixed him and gave him the worst possible fate , having to live as the miserable creature his fans believe him to be . So fast that nobody knows what happened , only that he came , he saw , and I conquered . His subconscious knows the truth , that he is less than an insect to me , that I can break him and put him back together before he takes a final gasp of the air he isn ’ t entitled to . And he is one of many . They come , they taunt , they balk , and then I send them home and they never come to me again . “ # 2 ” , “ # 3 ” , “ # 4 ” along with a many others in the top 500 know better than to knock on my door to “ usurp ” me . Some amongst them I subconsciously condemned to suffer a fate similar to my own . Although tenuous , their understanding of true power is somewhat acceptable ; that powerful is the state of not needing others to fear , respect , like , or hate you to be fully secure in one ’ s position . Others , are just fun to play with .
`` The town was in chaos for several months after the initial nuclear blast . Everyone had been irradiated and gained superhuman abilities . There were three main categories of powers gained : mental , physical and other . Once the chaos started to settle , these factions had then organized themselves into three separate micro-governments that ranked themselves based on strength . Every four months , the top three from each power faction would meet up and discuss issues that effected everyone , such as an organization system for placing people into the proper factions . They decided that everyone would be numbered . The bigger the number , the weaker you were and vice versa . Then , once a year , every single person would be re-numbered to account for powers waxing or waning over time . Then , if at any point in the year someone was unhappy with their number , they had the right to challenge the number directly superior to them and fight to the death . I was immediately placed into Other after the Strongest Nine had cleared up organization system . The reason was that , other than my eyes going solid white , I showed no evidence of having powers . This is exactly how I had wanted it . I knew deep inside myself that my powers were too strong and unique to be allowed to surface . The few people who had ever found out soon had the memory removed from them at my will . That was my power : will . I could impose my will on any living being so strongly that they have to obey or they will be driven mad . I tried not to use it too often at first , nothing more than to enable myself to be lazy and to get some of my closest friends a better place in life , but after nearly a decade of being selfless , I decided it was my time to rise . The Strongest Nine had become corrupt , their structure was practically nonexistent . They lived only for themselves . I had to do something to work my way to number 3 or higher . I began challenging people , forcing them to commit suicide so that I could advance . The climb from number 472 was slow , but steady . I paced myself so that it would n't seem I was too greedy , and finally I had made it ! The first new member of the Strongest Nine since the blast ! Naturally , everyone was terrified and jealous . Many people tried to bribe number 4 into killing me and finding out my secrets , but obviously that would never work . With me in the Strongest Nine , they suddenly had a major change of heart and reworked the entire system back to relative normality . After many years making sure that the system had been truly fixed and corruption-proofed , I set everything in order and dissappeared . Everyone thought they knew where I was and many even found where I hid , but the truth is that they came , they saw , and they were told to forget . I lived a peaceful life all alone and eventually I died in my sleep . But then I woke up here . '' The man in the lab coat nodded and scribbled some more down on the clipboard he held . He muttered to himself , something about `` increase the dosage '' and left . I was alone with my pillows once more .
Hello , my name is Tommy . I know what you 're probably thinking but no , I do n't have a cool name like Atom Smasher or Dr. Destro or anything like that . Just Tommy . What a lot of people do n't understand is that there are thousands of us ... . millions , maybe . We all have powers and most of us use them just to get by in the world . It 's not all flying around , punching criminals into the next zip code though . Most of us are n't that powerful . My best friend , Alex , glows in the dark . That 's it . His super power is to never need a flashlight . Anyways , we all have these little buttons that show our respective power levels . I 'm not sure where they came from or why everyone wears them , it 's just how it 's always been done . The numbers change based on the situation to show how powerful a particular person is in that situation . For example , on of the guys that lives down the hall from me is a werewolf . So for most of the month he 's powered somewhere around 16,000 , but on the night of the full moon he jumps up to 117 . That might seem like a big jump but remember my friend Alex ? His number is 1,367 . For every Captain Coast there are thousands of people like Alex . The numbers seem to change based of situational forces , cold-based powers get lower numbers in the winter and someone who channels sunlight has a higher number on a cloudy day . Anyways , I had managed to hide what I could do for most of my adult life . I 'm a healer . I 'm not entirely sure how it happens , but with concentration I can heal most injuries and illnesses . I ca n't bring people back from the dead , I 've tried and it did n't work ( R.I.P . Sarah ) . I 'm not able to do it a lot because it takes a lot out of me , but a few times a day I can help someone who needs it . I 've had a job in the hospital for a few years . Even wearing a number ( usually around 1,066 ) nobody seems surprised that I never showed any sorts of powers , some people have powers that just do n't do much . The first thing I noticed on that day was the strange looks people started giving me . People I 'd know for years were just looking sideways at me , people I 'd never met before had expressions ranging from disbelief to fear . I could n't figure it out until I went into the restroom and looked into the mirror . My number had changed and was now glowing with 512 . How did that happen ? How could somebody suddenly become twice as powerful as yesterday ? A glitch ? A mass cape-killing ? No , that could n't be it . I work in the hospital , I 'd have heard if there was some kind of mass superhero killing . I tried to ignore it and go about my day . Tried to keep my button hidden . Every time I quietly checked the number kept changing . 501 . 458 . 311 . 154 ? Now I remember seeing the Masked Avenger at 135 and she saved the world a few years ago . I was starting to get scared and was about to say to my boss that I was leaving for the day , then the rumbling started . The hallways suddenly shifted sideways and threw everybody off their feet . I landed in a darkened area ... must have fallen into the basement . The only light came from my glowing button , I looked down and my heart dropped as I saw a big , golden number 1 .
“ Wow that was awesome ! Do it again Sarah ! ” I shouted with glee . Sarah showed her perfect teeth as she saw how entertained I was . Her gaze was concentrated towards the fireworks that lay planted in the ground a few yards in front of her . Moments later , fireworks of all colors were bursting in the air . “ Whooo ! That was better than the last one ! ” She gave me a wink and I tried not to blush . Besides the firework display she put on , you could tell she had powers . On the back of both of her hands displayed a number . The number 2 ’ s were glowing a bright red , which stylishly matched her fire red hair . She was a Pyro . I ’ m not sure if it was her looks that attracted me or her powers . I mean don ’ t get me wrong , she was HOT . What ’ s not to like about a cute redhead with freckles and a petite frame ? But fire . I was in love with fire and she knew my weakness for it . Every time we met up she would always display her powers for me . Like a magician putting on a show for a mesmerized child . She would juggle fireballs , jumprope with an enflamed rope , she even lit her hands on fire and took my hands into hers . I was freaked out to say the least , but for some odd reason it didn ’ t burn me . There was no heat to any of her fire . I snapped back to reality . “ Man… you ’ re really lucky ” I said as I stared at the nakedness on the back of my hands . My smile had turned into a slight frown . I was just a regular human being . “ Lucky ? ” Sarah responded as if insulted . “ I would do anything to be normal… ” She showed the back of her hands to me . “ I ’ m marked . I ’ m an outcast . I can ’ t hide these stupid numbers . I ’ ve tried everything to cover them up . Makeup , gloves , the numbers just burn right through . And having these on your hand is the least of your worries . I can ’ t even make friends or live a normal life . And you know you ’ d be in deep trouble if your family or other Normals knew you were hanging out with me . There ’ s no place for me , not even within my own kind. ” I could see her eyes start to water . “ People like me . People with powers . They kill eachother . And for what ? To “ level up ” and become number 1 ? There is no normal Christmas for me , no birthday celebrations , no high school career . Trust me , you do not want this life Michael . I live in a chaotic world much different from yours ! ” At this point she was shouting and her face was covered in tears . I rushed to her and took her hands in mine feeling the warm glow of her numbers . “ I ’ m sorry Sarah I didn ’ t mean it. ” I wrapped my arms around her shivering body trying to calm her . “ Normal or not , you ’ re my best friend. ” At the back of my mind I couldn ’ t help but wonder how she got the number 2 on her hands , but I definitely wasn ’ t going to ask . It was getting dark and that meant Sarah had to go back to the city where she lived . If she stayed in the suburbs at night her glowing numbers would show like floodlights . It wasn ’ t exactly illegal for her to be here , but no Normal I knew liked her kind . “ I have to go. ” Sarah said sniffling and wiping the snot from her nose . “ Let me walk you. ” “ You know it ’ s not safe for you to come to the city. ” “ I ’ ll just walk you to the outskirts. ” I smiled trying to convince her . “ Okay fine. ” She said softly with a smile . It was about 6 miles that separated her world from mine . I put my arm over her shoulder and we started walking . I slowed to a stop and turned to Sarah . “ Well…I guess this is goodnight ? ” You could see the city alive behind us . “ Yeah , I guess so. ” “ No more tears okay ? ” “ No more tears ” she smiled slightly . Then tiptoed and kissed me on my cheek , right at the corner of my lips . I blushed hard , but thanked the night for concealing it . “ See you tomorrow ” she gave me a tight hug and started to walk away , her shining hands swaying in the night . Moments later I heard an incredible bang that echoed towards the sky . I turned to the direction it came from , towards Sarah . Her small silhouette dropped to the ground . “ Sarah ! ” I cried rushing towards her . “ M-Michael… ” I crouched to her and held her in my arms . “ Shh don ’ t talk . You ’ re going to be okay Sarah ! ” Blood gushed from her chest . “ Help me ! Someone help ! ” I shouted at the top of my lungs . The red 2 ’ s on Sarah ’ s hands started to go dim . “ Please Sarah , don ’ t leave me ! ” I held her head to my chest rocking back and forth . I could barely see Sarah ’ s beautiful face through my teary eyes . “ I ’ m sorry…I ’ m sorry I lied to you Michael ” she said with her last breath and closed her eyes . My tears fell on her freckled face . Then I heard the footsteps . They stopped right above me and Sarah . “ Hehehe…been eyeing Number 2 for quite some time kid. ” I looked up to see a man with a nasty grin on his unshaven face . A glowing 3 on the back of his hand . And where his other hand was supposed to be was a six shooter , with a glowing 3 that reflected light off its metallic surface . My attention was drawn back to Sarah , as the light on her 2 ’ s finally gave into the night . And that ’ s when it happened . “ Ooooh yeah baby , haven ’ t felt that in a looong time ! ” The man said with a rusty laugh while changing his piece back into a normal hand . The 3 ’ s on his hands morphed into the brighter 2 ’ s that Sarah once had . But something even brighter appeared , almost blindingly at first . I looked down and put Sarah ’ s frail body down gently . “ What the hell ? ! ” The man shouted . I slowly stood up still observing my hands . Bright 1 ’ s glowed deeply on my hands . My hands illuminated with a dark aura . I clenched them into fists and raised my head .
`` Now , what time is it ? 2:55 19th December ... i still have time , shell i get some coffee ? '' As I made my move toward the refreshment table , a guy in nice suit came up to me . `` Um ... Nice to meet you Mr Smith , my name is Alex Collins and I 'll be your interviewer today . '' `` Yes , i know who you are , nice to meet you , please call me James . '' Of course i know him , everyone knows him , he 's the popular tv show host right now , i put smile on my face and started to talk casually to him . It was familiar situation , people I meet usually gets nervous around me . `` We 're starting the show in one minute ! everybody back to their position ! '' We went back to our position and got ready for the interview . coffee in my hand , smile on my face . `` ... 3 ... .2 ... .1 ... .GO ! '' `` Show time . '' I said , finishing off the cup of coffee . ~~ ~~ ** '' Hello ! , and welcome back to the show ! For our next guest , there are n't much to say to introduce him , he was wrapped in the blanket of mystery and only thing we knew about him up until now was that he is currently ranked number 1 and no one has dared to challenge him for that title . But today , he has agreed to have an interview with us and show light to some of his mysterious life ! Please welcome to the stage , Mr James Smith ! `` ** It never got old , the sensation of people clapping , welcoming me onto the stage . With swift movement , i held my hand out and shock the hand of the presenter . ** '' Now , welcome to the show , how are you doing ? `` ** `` To be honest , bit nervous , this is my first interview after all . '' ** '' Yes I see . You were the only person out of the top 10 who never gave any interviews on live TV before ? I always though that 's the reason why you were kept at Number 1 spot , never giving your information away , so i want to ask , why did you decide to give come to the show and potentially give your rivals the chance to defeat you ? `` ** `` Well , first of all , i think this as a big gigantic game , where the winners get to live , and losers die , and the reason why I did n't give interviews were , quite frankly , i could n't be bothered , and that 's the only reason . But like all games , if you keep winning , you get bored very fast right ? that 's why i 'm here , i got too bored of the current situation and want to spice things up . i really could care about by rank , you can challenge me if you want , and i hope you do whoever watching this . '' ** '' right , so you were bored that no one was challenging you . so what did you do before deciding to come here ? before challenging everyone in the world ? `` ** `` i did nothing , that 's it , i just watched TV , browse internet , by the way i just found a site called reddit , it 's amazing , and normal stuff . '' ** '' ... so no training ? you did n't prepare for the potential attack or attacks on other people ? just sit at home and do nothing ? `` ** `` well ... i tried to get a proper job before , but when i showed up , everyone just screamed and ran out the door that i just came from . tried other job and same result . after about 10 times , i just gave up . '' ** '' i see , so then , i 'm guessing that your power is n't offensive type then , since you do n't train for it and do n't use them to hunt others down , am i right ? `` ** `` yes '' ** '' then do you have any idea why that you are number 1 ? i mean , everyone in top 10 except for you all have offensive type power , there 's one that can set things on fire , one that can manipulate your body to whatever , and let 's not forget Number two , the `` Sonic '' who can cause massive pressure wave that will kill you in an instant . `` ** `` first of all , honestly , i do n't know how he can be Number 2 with that kind of power , it 's quite laughable . and secondly , i seriously do n't know , i 'm actually surprised my self that i survived this long without getting stabbed , or burned , or thrown off the cliff . i really do n't know . '' ** '' ah , i see . and hopefully , after this interview , you will get more attention you deserve , and like you hoped , will get more challenges . `` ** `` yes , defiantly . '' ** '' well , sadly , that is ten minutes up , we need to move onto next guest , so sadly , i have to bid you farewell . `` ** `` it was a pleasure . '' ** '' well folks , stay tuned as our next guest will literally make you jump out of your seats . `` ** ~~ ~~ `` and cut . let 's take a break now guys ! '' it was over , i got off to the stage and started to make my leave . `` Umm , excuse me ! '' i turned around and saw the presenter running upto me . `` yes ? '' `` i know this is bit too late but ... were you certain about doing todays interview ? i mean , giving hints about your power is one thing , but dissing the Number 2 like that ... '' `` No , it 's all right , i 'm fine , seriously . i mean , i 'm certain that they wo n't remember what we said today int he interview , they are that stupid . '' I said , cutting him off mid sentence . `` I ... I see ... '' `` Well then , i 'll see you next week . '' `` ok ... wait , next week ? what are you ... '' i left the building , did n't give him chance to ask more questions . his and everyone on the set had this really confused face on them . always managed crack a smile onto my face . ~~ ~~ `` Now , what time is it ? 2:55 26th December ... i still have time , shell i get some coffee ? '' As I made my move toward the refreshment table , a guy in nice suit came up to me . `` Um ... Nice to meet you Mr Smith , my name is Alex Collins and I 'll be your interviewer today . '' `` Yes , i know who you are , nice to meet you , please call me James . ''
You want an interview ? Fine , but you 're buying the coffee . I 'm getting kind of sick of this god-damned urban legend . I DO N'T have superpowers , no-one has superpowers . There are just a bunch of crazy people who think they have powers , who for some reason have decided that I 'm some fucked up version of their messiah . **You do n't believe super-powered people exist ? ** No . I 've never seen one . I 've seen the doctored footage from the media . I 've seen a lot of crazy people who thought they had powers . I do n't know why they gravitate to me of all people . I 'm just a regular guy . I put in my hours in the office , then at the gym . **So you have n't heard about the ranking system ? ** Oh , I 've heard of their ranking system all right . That 's all I ever hear . What baffles me is why they chose me to be their number one , their highest rank . That the only way for people to rise in rank and become more powerful is to kill them . Does that sound sane to you ? Then one day , some poor bastard commits suicide near me , and suddenly , they decide that I 'm the number one on their hitlist . **You are referring to the death of the Human Jet as suicide ? ** Man faceplants on the ground from a hundred feet , that 's suicide . It does n't matter that he said `` Up Up and Away '' before he jumped off that building . That was suicide . **The Human Jet was one of our greatest heroes , with documented evidence of his powers..** Blah Blah Blah . I 've heard that all before . I was there , I saw him hit the ground . Where the hell do you people in the media get off encouraging these people . They are a danger to themselves . Surely you must have learned your lesson after Inferno Man . **Inferno Man was a criminal , whose control over fire rendered him a threat to the world ... ** Bullshit . Let me tell you what happened when I met this so called inferno man . I was just hanging out in a cafe not far from here , when this asshole shows up in a stupid costume . He bursts in , and gives this long speech about how he 's going to kill me and burn everything down . Then nothing happened . He stood there for like five minutes , straining , and glaring at me . I do n't know what I did , I just wanted my cup 'o ' joe . Then he leaves , and I thought `` That was weird , I 'm glad it 's over '' . Then he comes back , with a barrel of gasoline . Who the fuck would sell him gasoline . that 's beside the point . The point is that the fucker doused himself in the stuff , and then pulled out a lighter and set himself on fire . Right in front of me . Hearing him scream almost put me off my coffee . **Yes , quite a lot of superpowered villains have died under similar mysterious circumstances in your presence** If by superpowered people , you mean insane people , then yes . The numbers of clowns in capes who drop out of the sky near me is so bloody annoying . Not to mention the scrawny fucks who just straight up try to pick fights with me . Oh god , there was one which was genuinely funny . This guy came up to me with this long speech about how he is one with nature , and that he will use all of his power to destroy me . I do n't know why these guys always got ta speech at me . When I punch someone , I punch'em , I do n't tell 'em my life story . He had this tiger with him . Big fucking cat . He told the tiger to get me . Moment the muzzle was off , it savaged him . I fucking split my sides . **So you do n't think you have any superpowers at all ? ** Course not . Like I said *nobody* has superpowers . At least not that I 've seen , not when they 're around me .
At first , I was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I felt like I was being flooded with a wave of warmth and joy that I had never experienced before . I was so overwhelmed that I had to take a few moments to process it all . Once I was able to take it all in , I was filled with a sense of contentment and peace . I felt like I could finally breathe and enjoy life . I was no longer weighed down by the sadness and fear that had been my constant companions . I was so grateful to the person who had donated happiness to me . I was so thankful that they had taken the time to think of me and to give me something that I had been missing for so long . I now make sure to take the time to appreciate the little things in life and to be thankful for the people who have helped me along the way . I am so grateful for the gift of happiness that I received and I will never forget it .
I won the championship last year by going back to April 30 , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods : I first used a time machine to travel back to the day of Hitler 's suicide and then I used a powerful laser to shoot him in the head . The time machine allowed me to arrive at the exact moment that Hitler was about to commit suicide , and the laser allowed me to shoot him in the head without anyone noticing . This was a difficult task , as I had to make sure that I was in the right place at the right time and that I had the right equipment . I was able to pull it off , however , and I was awarded the championship for my creativity and difficulty . It was a great feeling to know that I had accomplished something that no one else had ever done before .
You stand there , looking at your own reflection . You feel a deep sense of regret and sorrow for the things you have done in your life . You realize that you have hurt yourself the most , and you must forgive yourself in order to move on . You take a deep breath and close your eyes , and you feel a wave of peace wash over you . You open your eyes and you are in Heaven .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere . She was an only child and her parents were very strict , so she had to find ways to entertain herself . One day , while exploring the woods near her house , she stumbled upon a mysterious cave . She was curious and decided to explore it . Inside the cave , she found a magical world filled with strange creatures and wondrous sights . She was amazed and could n't believe her eyes . She explored the cave for hours , discovering new things every step of the way . Eventually , she came across a small pond in the center of the cave . In the pond was a beautiful golden fish . The fish spoke to her and told her that it was a magical fish and that it could grant her three wishes . Sarah was overjoyed and quickly made her three wishes . The first wish was for her parents to be less strict , the second wish was for her to have more friends , and the third wish was for her to be able to explore the magical world of the cave whenever she wanted . The fish granted her wishes and Sarah was ecstatic . She thanked the fish and ran home to tell her parents the good news . From then on , Sarah was able to explore the magical world of the cave whenever she wanted and she made many new friends . She was so happy and grateful for the magical fish and the wonderful wishes it had granted her .
You stand there , looking at your own reflection , and you feel a wave of guilt and regret wash over you . You realize that you have hurt yourself the most in life , and you must make amends . You take a deep breath and begin to apologize for all the times you have been unkind to yourself , for all the times you have been too hard on yourself , and for all the times you have not given yourself the love and respect you deserve . You forgive yourself for all the mistakes you have made , and you promise to be kinder to yourself in the future . You feel a sense of peace and understanding wash over you , and you know that you have been forgiven . You have been granted access to Heaven .
The sun was setting on the horizon , casting a golden hue over the small town . It was a peaceful evening , the kind that made you want to take a deep breath and just enjoy the moment . But for one family , this peaceful evening was about to be shattered . As they stepped out of their house , they heard a loud crash coming from the nearby woods . What could it be ? They had no idea , but they knew they had to find out .
At first , I was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I felt like I was being bombarded with a wave of unfamiliar feelings .

The sky was a deep , inky black , and the stars sparkled like diamonds against the night . It was a crisp , cold winter night in the old town of Carrington , and the streets were eerily quiet . There was a sense of something sinister lurking in the shadows , and a chill ran through the air . The only sound that could be heard was the howling of the wind through the trees , and the occasional creak of an old , forgotten house . It was a place where time seemed to stand still , and no one seemed to have ventured into its depths for many years . But on this night , something stirred in the shadows . Something that had been slumbering in the darkness for centuries . Something that was about to change the lives of everyone living in Carrington , and beyond . The townspeople had no idea they were about to be plunged into a world of magic and mystery , of danger and adventure . They had no idea that their lives would be changed forever . But as the night wore on , something stirred in the shadows . Something was about to awaken . Something was about to begin .

I knew that if someone found out about my power , they could use it against me . But I was determined to protect my secret and my place at the top of the rankings . I was determined to stay at the top , and I was determined to keep my power hidden . The people of Sanctuary may have had extraordinary powers , but I was determined to keep mine a secret . No matter what it took .

Once upon a time there was a kingdom ruled by a wise king . The kingdom was known for its beauty , its abundance of resources , and its peacefulness . The king was a gentle and kind ruler , who was beloved by all . One day , the king heard a rumor of a powerful dragon living in the nearby mountains . The dragon , it was said , had a hoard of treasure that was said to be unrivaled in all the land . The king , desiring to offer his people a better life , decided to go forth and slay the dragon himself . The king set out , accompanied by his bravest knights , and began their arduous journey to the dragon 's lair . The closer they drew to the dragon 's home , the more difficult the journey became . Dense forests , treacherous ravines , and rocky terrain slowed their progress . Finally , after days of travel , the group arrived at the dragon 's lair . The dragon , seeing the king and his knights , grew angry and attacked them with fire and smoke . The knights fought back bravely , but the dragon was too powerful . The king , however , refused to give up . He remembered his people and what he was fighting for , and he drew upon a strength he never knew he had . The king and his knights defeated the dragon and the king was hailed as a hero . He brought back the dragon 's treasure , which he distributed among his people . The kingdom flourished and the people lived in peace and prosperity . The king 's courage and determination were an inspiration to all , and he was remembered as a great ruler who put the needs of his people before his own .

Despite this , John had never given up on the relationship and always believed that one day things would get better . One night , after a particularly heated argument , John finally had enough . He stormed out of their house and drove away . Anna did n't know what to do , so she just sat in the living room until late in the night , sobbing and thinking about the situation . The next morning , John came back early , determined to make things right . He went to the living room and found Anna still there . He asked her if they could talk , but she did n't say anything .

'' Those four little words meant more to John than he could ever express . He hugged her tightly and they both knew that things were finally going to be alright .

The challenge was to find a way to kill Hitler without changing the course of history . It was a daunting task , but I was determined to succeed . I began my quest by researching all the known details of Hitler 's life and the events that surrounded him . After days of studying , I came up with an ingenious plan . I would travel back in time to the year 1939 , when Hitler was at the height of his power . I knew that I had to make sure that my actions would n't adversely affect any of the events of the time . To do this , I created a distraction . I set off a series of small explosions around Berlin , drawing the attention of the police away from Hitler . While the police were distracted , I snuck into Hitler 's office and quickly injected him with a deadly toxin . By the time the police realized what was happening , it was too late . Hitler was dead and history was intact . My plan worked perfectly and I was declared the champion . I had succeeded in killing Hitler without changing the course of history .
I won last year 's time travel championship by executing a daring and clever plan . After arriving in Germany , I first located Hitler 's hideout and then proceeded to distract his guards by setting off a series of loud explosions around the perimeter . While they were busy investigating the source of the noise , I snuck inside and confronted Hitler in his office . Using my quick wit and persuasive powers , I convinced him to commit suicide . I then set off a series of fireworks to create a distraction and used the chaos to quickly escape . My plan worked perfectly and I was able to return to my own time without any further complications . My creativity and bravery earned me a well-deserved first place finish in the competition .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Emma who lived in a small village in the countryside .

She decided to explore it , and soon found herself in a magical world filled with amazing creatures and beautiful landscapes . Emma quickly made friends with the creatures she encountered and soon found herself on a quest to find a mysterious relic that would help her save the kingdom . Along the way , she encountered many strange and wonderful creatures , made allies with powerful wizards , and fought her way through treacherous dungeons . Eventually , Emma found the relic and returned to the village with it . The villagers were overjoyed and , in honor of Emma 's brave and noble deeds , they declared her a hero . From that day forth , Emma was known far and wide as the brave and noble hero who saved the kingdom .
I won last year 's championship by going back to 1939 and changing the course of history . I started by infiltrating Hitler 's inner circle and convincing him to step down as leader of the Nazi party . Then I spread the word to the German people that he had been replaced , and the Nazi movement was no longer supported by the government . Next , I worked with the Allied powers to create a plan to ensure that Hitler would not be able to regain power . I organized a network of spies and informants to keep tabs on Hitler 's activities and report any suspicious activity . I also used my influence to get the Allied forces to start planning a direct attack on Hitler 's headquarters . Finally , when the time was right , I infiltrated Hitler 's headquarters on the night of his death . I snuck past his guards and placed a powerful explosive in his bedroom . The blast killed him instantly , ensuring that he would never be able to regain power . My strategy worked and I was declared the winner of the championship . I 'm proud of the part I played in stopping one of the most evil men in history , and I hope that my actions will be remembered for a long time to come .

It was a bright summer day , the sun shining in all its glory . Birds sang in the treetops , a gentle breeze wafting over the meadow . The little girl smiled , feeling the warmth of the day on her skin . She skipped down the path , the grass tickling her toes . Reaching the pond , she paused in wonder , taking in its beauty . A dragonfly flew past , its iridescent wings glinting in the sun . Taking a deep breath , she waded in , the cool water soothing her . She closed her eyes and whispered a silent prayer , thanking the heavens for this moment . Peace .
At first , I did n't know how to process the feeling of happiness . It was like a foreign emotion that I had never felt before . It was strange and unfamiliar , but also strangely comforting . I soon began to realize that this feeling was far better than the emptiness I had been used to . I began to feel more content , my outlook on life changed , and I was filled with a newfound sense of optimism . I decided to keep the donation box open and to share the feeling of happiness with others . I was surprised by the amount of people who stopped by to donate their unwanted emotions . It was heartwarming to see the happiness spreading in my community , and I was amazed by the power of emotions . I had learned that by sharing our emotions with others , we can create a better world for everyone .

The city was a strange place . It was full of people with mysterious powers , ranging from the ability to control the elements to teleportation and telepathy . Everyone was ranked according to their power , but the top spot was always empty . Despite the whispers and rumors , no one knew who held the rank of # 1 in the city . I was the # 1 , but it was a secret I kept hidden , even from those closest to me . My power was unique , and it was something I had kept to myself for as long as I could remember . I had the ability to manipulate the minds of others , and I was able to do so without being detected . It was a dangerous ability , but it was also my greatest asset . With it , I was able to control the actions of those around me . I could manipulate the minds of the powerful and the weak alike , making them believe whatever I wanted them to . Yet , I did not use this ability frivolously . I was aware of its potential for abuse , and I had sworn to use it only for good . I wanted to use it to protect the city , to prevent anyone from taking advantage of its inhabitants . But my power had not gone unnoticed . I had heard rumors that there were those who wanted to kill me and take my place as the # 1 . Others wanted to use my power for their own gain , and they were willing to do anything to get it . I knew I had to be careful . Even though I was the # 1 , I was vulnerable . I had to be aware of the dangers around me , and I had to be prepared to fight for my position . That was why I had kept my power a secret . I knew that if anyone found out , they would want to use it , or they might even try to kill me to take my place . But I had trained my entire life to be the best . I had honed my skills and sharpened my senses , and I was confident that I could protect myself from any danger . I had earned my place as the # 1 , and I would do whatever I had to do to keep it .

I won the championship last year by using a combination of ingenuity and daring . It all started when I travelled back to 1942 and located Hitler in his bunker . I then devised a plan that involved a series of stratagems . First , I used a mind-control device to temporarily take control of one of his key advisors . I then convinced the advisor to present a false set of orders to Hitler directing him to move to a distant location to attend a secret meeting . Second , I infiltrated the bunker by disguising myself as a member of the SS , and managed to get close enough to Hitler to deliver a fatal dose of poison to him . As the poison took effect , I made my escape from the bunker . Finally , in my escape , I had to contend with an elite group of Nazi bodyguards . I used a number of ingenious tactics to slow them down and make my escape , including setting fire to several oil barrels and setting off a series of explosions . In the end , I emerged triumphant , having completed my mission and escaped without a trace . My success in this daring mission earned me the title of last year ’ s champion among time travelers .

Last year , I traveled back in time to Nazi Germany with a single mission in mind : to kill Adolf Hitler . In order to maximize my score and make the mission as difficult as possible , I had come up with a plan that I thought was pretty creative . I traveled to the year 1938 and made my way to the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich , Germany , where Hitler was scheduled to give a speech that evening . Knowing that he would be surrounded by bodyguards , I decided I had to come up with a way to get rid of them without raising too much suspicion . My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to 1938 earlier in the day . Then , I used some of my modern day technology to create a diversion . I hacked into the PA system at the Bürgerbräukeller and broadcast a message that a bomb was set to go off in the building . The message caused mass panic and everyone evacuated , including Hitler ’ s bodyguards . With the bodyguards out of the way , I was able to sneak in unnoticed and find Hitler . I quickly pulled out my handgun and shot him twice , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was awarded the highest score of the year . I was the undisputed champion of time traveling Hitler-killers .

The truth was , I had the power to manipulate energy and matter , though I had kept this hidden from everyone , even those closest to me . It was n't until a particularly powerful challenger appeared that I finally revealed the extent of my abilities . With a wave of my hand , I caused their attacks to be diverted and their efforts thwarted . As they realized the futility of their efforts , they left in shame , and I was once again left in peace . But while I was hailed as the most powerful of the powered , my secret was out , and so was my discomfort with the attention I was receiving . I soon realized that my rank and power made me a target , and that I would have to use my abilities to protect myself . I quickly arranged for the construction of an energy shield around my apartment , so that no one would be able to enter without my permission . Then , I began to use my powers to defend myself in the event of any attack . I had to be careful though , as even the slightest use of my powers could be detected by those with the ability to sense energy . Though I was now the most powerful of the powered , I was also the most vulnerable . I had to remain aware of my surroundings and use my powers wisely , for even the slightest lapse of judgement could mean my downfall . But despite the danger , I stayed true to my convictions and never used my powers to harm anyone . I had become the top-ranked resident of the city of the powered , but it had come at a price . I had to live with the constant fear of being discovered and attacked . I had to be vigilant and use my powers sparingly , and always remember that I was the one responsible for protecting myself .

The city of Haven was bustling with the hustle and bustle of its citizens . Everyone had a special power , from telekinesis to electro-kinesis , to sensors and beyond . The citizens were ranked according to their powers , with rank # 1 being the most powerful . My name is Reagan and I was at the very top of the rankings with no one knowing what my power was . I had kept it a well-guarded secret , even from my closest friends and family . To protect myself , I had created a powerful shield that blocked others from being able to sense my power . I was the most powerful person in the city but that also meant that I was seen as the biggest threat . I had to constantly be on my guard against those who wanted to take my place as the top-ranking individual . Due to the ranking system , it was possible for someone of a lower rank to kill a person of a higher rank and take their place . This was known as the `` rank kill . '' People would often use this as a way to make their way to the top . I lived in constant fear of being killed by someone who wanted to take my place . I was always watching my back and never strayed too far from the safety of my home . One night , while I was out getting some supplies , I was attacked by a group of people who wanted to overtake me as rank # 1 . I quickly erected a powerful shield around me and managed to fend them off . As I looked around , I realized that I had been successful in keeping my secret safe . No one knew what my power was and I was able to keep my position . Since that day , I have continued to stay at the top of the rankings . I may not know what my power is but I know that I am powerful enough to keep my place as the number one ranked person in the city of Haven .

Everyone in the city was born with some kind of power , from the seemingly simple telekinesis to the truly spectacular electrokinesis . And , like the lands of old , everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were . But this city had a unique , albeit unknown , feature : Rank # 1 was indestructible . Whoever held that spot was completely untouchable , and their power was a mystery . For as long as anyone could remember , that person had been me . It was n't something I 'd ever asked for or wanted , yet here I was . Everyone seemed to know that I was Rank # 1 , and yet no one had any idea what my power was . For a while , things had been peaceful . Sure , people were jealous of my rank and the power that came with it , but no one dared to challenge me . That is , until one day . A man , known as the Black King , had come to the city . He was a powerful man , with a power similar to mine , and he wanted to take my rank . He challenged me to a duel and I accepted . We both knew the stakes : If I lost , I would lose my rank and the Black King would take my place . We prepared for battle . I could feel the tension in the air as the people of the city watched , their eyes wide with anticipation . When the moment came , I did something unexpected . I stepped forward and , instead of using my mysterious power , I knelt at the Black King 's feet and surrendered . At first , he was surprised . Then , a huge smile appeared on his face . He knew that he had a powerful enemy in me , one who had chosen to surrender instead of risk a fight . In that moment , the Black King had a new found respect for me . From then on , he never questioned my rank nor my mysterious power . To this day , I still have no idea what my power is , but I do know that it is far more powerful than any of the other powers in this city . I also know that I must use it wisely and only when necessary . The people in this city may not understand my power , but they do understand the power of surrender .
My victory last year was a testament to my creative thinking and patience . It took me a few tries , but eventually I managed to devise a plan to outsmart Hitler in the end . The first thing I did was to travel back to Germany in the 1930s , when Hitler was still rising to power . This allowed me to observe the Fuhrer and study his habits . I was able to pick up on clues about his daily routine , his inner circle , and the places he frequented . The next step was to craft a plan to catch Hitler off guard . I decided to set up a fake charity event on the same day as a rally he was scheduled to attend . I enlisted the help of local volunteers , and as the Fuhrer was on his way to the rally , we quickly set up a large banner welcoming Hitler to the Fundraiser . However , when Hitler 's motorcade arrived , I had my men ready to pour gasoline all over him and set him on fire . The flames were large and quick and the Fuhrer did n't have enough time to escape . Luckily , nobody else was hurt in the process . My daring plan managed to win me the prize for creativity and difficulty . To this day , I 'm still the reigning champion in the time-travelling sport of `` Killing Hitler . ''
I won last year 's challenge by creating an elaborate plan that took months of preparation . I traveled back in time to late April 1945 , when Hitler 's bunker was surrounded by Soviet troops . My plan was to gain access to the bunker and assassinate him before the Soviets arrived . First , I infiltrated a crowd of Hitler 's supporters and convinced them to help me . Then , I gathered a few of the senior officers in Hitler 's inner circle and convinced them to stage a coup . When the coup was successful , I took control of the bunker and arrested any Nazi loyalists . Next , I searched the bunker and found a secret passage leading to Hitler 's private quarters . Once inside his room , I quickly cornered him and shot him dead with a silenced pistol . The plan was risky , but by using a combination of charisma and guile , I was able to successfully complete the mission . As a result , I won last year 's championship and gained the admiration of every time traveler in the world .

But one creature in particular stood out among them all - the elves . The elves were peaceful and wise , and they lived in harmony with the land and its other inhabitants . They were skilled in the arts of crafting and magic , and used these skills to make beautiful tools , weapons , and items of power . But soon , their peaceful existence was threatened . A powerful evil force had arisen in the land , a force which threatened to destroy all the elves had built . With no one else to turn to , the elves rallied to the call of their leader , King Alaric . Alaric was a brave and noble elf whose wisdom and courage was renowned throughout the land . He vowed to protect his people , and declared he would take on the evil force himself , no matter the cost . He gathered his bravest champions and marched off to fight the enemy .

It was always assumed I was the most powerful person in the city . Everyone else had their powers , telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , all the trends you 'd expect . But here I was , untouchable , untitled , veiled in mystery . I kept it that way , too . I never wanted anyone to know what kind of power I had , if any . I wanted to remain a shadow , a ghost amongst them , watching , but never being noticed . But then I had to end it all . I was on the brink of a great war and the stakes were high : I either annihilate my adversaries , or they would annihilate me . I knew the only way to stay one step ahead would be to take out the competition . So , I set out to do just that . I used my unknown power to dispatch each of the competitors , carefully and skillfully avoiding detection . Before long , I had taken out the entire chain of command , one by one , and soon , I was the only one left standing . I was the number one in the city and no one knew what my power was . That pleased me just fine . As far as everyone else was concerned , I was the most powerful person in the city and no one dared challenge me . I kept my secret to myself and that 's how I maintained my dominance . It was a strange and lonely kind of existence but I was content with it . I was finally safe , and I could finally end this arbitrary competition that had pitted us all against each other for so long . So , I vowed to remain in my place , the invisible protector and guiding light of the city . I refused to use my power for anything but protection and no one ever questioned my supremacy .
Once upon a time , there was a kingdom perched atop a seemingly endless mountain . The kingdom was prosperous and peaceful , until one day when a wild beast appeared atop the mountain . This beast was of immense size and power , and no one in the kingdom had faced such a creature before . The King of the kingdom sent a party of soldiers to confront the beast , but they were no match for it . They could not even scratch its thick hide . The King , in desperation , called upon the aid of a mysterious wizard that lived in a cave deeper in the mountain . The wizard , an old and grizzled man , told the King that the only way to defeat the beast was to create a new weapon- one made of the strongest and purest materials . He warned the King that this weapon would be powerful enough to destroy the beast , but could also prove perilous to the wielder . The King , desperate to rid his kingdom of the beast , ordered his best smiths and craftsmen to create the weapon . After much hard work , the weapon was completed- a mighty sword of hammered steel , inlaid with jewels and crafted to be both beautiful and lethal . The King armed several of his bravest warriors with the weapon and they set off to confront the beast atop the mountain . The beast was fierce and strong , but the warriors and their new weapon proved too powerful and it was soon vanquished . The Kingdom was saved and the King awarded the brave warriors with great honors , the weapon was kept safe in the treasury and the great wizard vanished as mysteriously as he had arrived . This is the tale of the sword they called , The Slayer of Beasts .

It all started with a daring mission just outside of Berlin in the spring of 1945 . I had heard rumors of Hitler ’ s plans to launch a rocket attack against Britain and knew I had to act fast . After taking out two guards at the facility , I set up a small device which detonated in the vicinity of Hitler 's office . As the smoke cleared , I could see the Führer lying dead on the floor . The point system had me tied with two other time travelers , so to make sure I took first place I decided to take my mission one step further . I headed back further in time , using an extensive knowledge of German history , I was able to accurately predict Hitler 's next public appearance and set up a trap . As he spoke to the crowd , I detonated a small explosive device in the ground , killing him instantly . The judges praised my creativity and execution , and ultimately awarded me the top spot . With that , I was crowned champion and became the first time traveler to successfully kill Hitler . It ’ s been an incredible journey , and I ’ m proud to carry the title of Time Traveler Champion . I look forward to what the future may bring , and hope to inspire others to use their skills and knowledge to make history .

At first , I was confused by this alien emotion that was coursing through my veins .

People who had lived with excess emotions -- despair , anger , envy -- began to donate , allowing them to live more reasonable and happier lives . All around me , joy , laughter and love flourished . I was admired for my selfless act and the remarkable impact it had on people 's lives . I was no longer weighed down by the burden of my own hardship , but instead bolstered with the knowledge that I had given others the chance to feel what I now felt -- happiness .
My strategy for winning the annual time travel contest was to create an intricate and complex mission with a combination of strategies designed to ensure success . The goal was for me to travel back to a specific time and place and kill Hitler without being seen . I began by researching Hitler 's schedule as far in advance as I could . I searched through archives to determine where he would be at a specific time and also identified potential points of vulnerabilities . I then looked into the weather , studying documents to see what conditions Hitler was most likely to be in if I were to make it to that point in time . Once I had all of my preparation done , I set off . I planned my time travel route so that it set me up in a position where I could easily attack without being noticed . I had to move strategically as I could not risk being spotted . In order to reach my chosen window of opportunity , I moved from place to place , carefully timing my movements and watching for any potential threats . After making it to my point of attack , I carefully aimed and fired the deadly shot . The plan worked perfectly and the assassination was successful . I had done it ; Hitler was dead . In the end , I proved to be a master of strategy , patience and timing . My effort won me the contest for the year and made me the undisputed champion of time travel assassins .
I awoke with a start , the early morning sun shimmering in my eyes . My groggy mind foggy and unclear , yet my heart was full of anticipation . Dreams of glory , honour and success , all of which I would yet achieve . My bliss was soon to be shattered , as reality came in quick succession . The bed was too hard , the room too small , my energy felt sapped away . A sense of dread crept upon me ; this was n't the place I belonged . The feeling of helplessness was hard to bear , so I decided to take action . The clock ticked , now the time was nigh , I had to take a stand . Rising from that room and going forth into a new life ahead . Bravely I embraced all the possibilities , seeking the path less travelled . The journey was taxing , the route complicated and toil relentless . But my desire kept me going , toward the promised land I saw . The hardships were surpassed , the goals set became achievements . Success had come but at a price and I felt numb to it all . A moment of respite , peace in a veil of quietude . Thoughts of complacence , yet a will to explore more . Swallowing the pain , I pushed onward , determined to explore . A whisper of hope , a flicker of life all I had left to rely on . Fear ...
That day changed my life . At first , I was skeptical of this strange gift , but little by little I experimented with it and soon , I began to feel what it meant to be happy . I started to appreciate things in life that I had never noticed before . My days began to be filled with joy and laughter . I found myself enjoying conversations and activities with people I never thought I would have connection to . I saw the potential that happiness had to completely change the way I experienced life . It was something that I could share with others and see them smile , too . The donation box taught me an invaluable lesson : even the simplest of emotions can make a huge difference in someone 's life . It also showed me the importance of both giving and receiving emotions . It is through this discovery that I began to understand the meaning of true happiness . I am truly grateful for the gift of happiness that I was able to find in the donation box .
I am the most powerful person in this city , though almost no one knows what my power is . I have obtained the highest rank and yet no one can figure out how I manage to stay on top of the rankings . All they know is that no one who challenges me triumphs and that my mysterious power allows me to overcome their mightiest efforts . My journey to the top of the rankings began many years ago . At a young age , I had developed an ability to sense when danger was near , allowing me to prepare for imminent threats and troubles before they reached me . I soon adapted my powers , learning to use the information I received to rescue people in danger , and to avoid disasters before they happened . My skills in sensing danger and in avoiding harm quickly gained me admiration and fear in the city . But over time , my power started to evolve into more than mere advance warnings . I found that I could control the elements and energies around me , including electricity and magnetism . In short , I could bend the laws of nature to my will . I could also draw energy from my environment and use it to further empower me and to protect those I cared about . Such talents naturally put me at the top of the rankings . With my skills , I was able to defeat and even kill those who had more power than me , taking their rank and becoming the most powerful person in the city . Yet , I remain a mystery to most . No one knows just how far my power can go and what my ultimate limit is . I remain the most powerful person in the city and in the rankings , yet no one really knows what kind of powers I have . Everyone is afraid to challenge me , knowing that they wo n't be able to overcome me . And so I reign without opposition , my mysterious powers protecting the people of this city and keeping order among the powerful .
Once upon a time there lived an old man named Jacob . He lived alone in an old cottage on the outskirts of a small village , away from the hustle and bustle of city life . Jacob had lived there for as long as anyone could remember and people in the village spoke of him with reverence and admiration . His small cottage was a calm , peaceful refuge from the chaotic world outside . Jacob would often spend his days tending to the small garden he kept or watching the birds fly by . He was always thoughtful and kind , and those who visited him found peace in his presence . One day , while tending to his garden , Jacob discovered a small bird with a broken wing . Not wanting to see the poor creature suffer , he built a nest and nursed the bird back to health . Jacob found a special connection with this bird , as if it were his own , and he named it Simon . Word quickly spread of Jacob 's kindness and soon people from near and far were coming to see him and his bird . He had become a local celebrity and was looked up to with reverence and respect . Jacob and his life-long companion Simon lived in the small cottage for many years , watched over by the villagers who loved them . When Jacob passed away , Simon could no longer stay , but he always remembered his kind , gentle friend .

First Paragraph : Owen had heard about this place his entire life , but never dared to imagine actually standing there . Somehow the charred remains of the old , abandoned farmhouse seemed so familiar , yet so distant . With a promise to himself , he steeled his nerves and stepped through the wooden gate , breathing in the musty scent of bygone days . Last Paragraph : The dust swirled in the air , breaking the magic of the moment . He felt the call of the past , but knew it was time to reshape his future . He stepped away from the gate , certain that this place had changed him forever ; that it would forever stay with him as a reminder of what is possible .

His feet moved faster and faster until he finally stood in front of the dark building . Taking a deep breath , he turned away and began the journey home , his mind relieved and a pleased smile on his lips . Freedom .

You realize that it was not selfish for you to love and care for yourself because it was the only way you were going to reach your goals and to create a better future for yourself .

Grunting and swearing , she trudged through the thick mud . Unfamiliar birds squawked overhead , adding to her stress . Tension bubbled under the surface , it seemed every step was a challenge . In the eerie stillness , she felt her heart racing . Exhaustion began to set in , and still she pushed on . The trees seemed to reach out , clawing at her being . Trying to turn her away from her destination . Unyielding , she pushed forward , relentless in her journey . Finally , she could make out the dim outlines of a cottage . Relief flooded her veins , as she stumbled to the door . With shaking hands , she looked for a path inside . As she stepped over the threshold , she whispered . `` Home . ''

It had been said that no one was more powerful than I . For two years , I had maintained my rank of # 1 in this strange and wondrous city . People had claimed to know my mysterious powers , but none had yet been able to definitively confirm what they were . That was about to change for me however , when a young upstart came calling , with the intention of taking my coveted rank , and the mystery around my abilities , along with it . His name was Victor , and his powers were undeniable . He could manipulate both electric and magnetic fields with the twitch of his finger , an impressive feat for someone so young . He had been rapidly rising in the ranks and proved to be a formidable challenge to any opponent . Naturally , I was wary , but I had no idea what else to do . I knew I had to face him in a duel , or risk losing my rank and the mysterious powers that came with it . I prepared for the battle of my life , determined to show Victor that I was more powerful than anyone had yet seen . The day of our duel came , and the city gathered to witness what would be a clash between two supremely powerful forces . To everyone 's shock and awe , I soon revealed my power to be the ability to manipulate time . Time , the fundamental variable that all life is subject to , was now in my whimsical grasp . As the duel progressed , I could feel my energy and skill reaching a fever pitch . I was able to freeze time at opportune moments , allowing myself to stay one step ahead of Victor and denying him the advantage he sought . In the end , I emerged victorious and retained my rank of # 1 in the city . From then on , no one had any doubts as to why I was at the top of the power rankings . Nevertheless , from time to time I still catch glimpses of Victor around the city , and catch whispers of his attempts to defeat me in a rematch . Until that date comes , I will remain the mysterious , powerful , and undefeated # 1 in this city of extraordinary individuals .

Prologue The distant echoes of laughter filled the cool night air . Getting off the subway , the street was alive with conversations and sounds of the city . Walking down the humble street , he caught the glint of a street lamp and turned , following its path . Standing at the edge of the park , he could see the foliage of the trees spread out in all directions , the canopy of stars that swirled around him . The only thing he could hear now was the faint sound of music playing from somewhere in the distance . The tone of the music was familiar yet far away , like a memory , teasing at his conscience . The sound of laughter and music grew louder as he stepped closer to the park , and he had the sensation of being watched . He spun around him , his gaze passing over rows of deserted benches , their shapes indistinct under the shadows of the night . Stepping into the park , he felt small – a tiny speck in the vastness of the night . He took off his hat and closed his eyes , the beat of the music throbbing in his chest . He breathed in , letting the smell of flowers and grass flow through his senses , a temporary oasis in the midst of the concrete world he 'd just left behind . He stopped , looking around for the source of the music and spotted a figure at the edge of the park . But he barely noticed it as he was captivated by the light that seemed to be pouring from the sky itself . He stood there , watching as the lights glinted and glittered like stars , filling the night with a gentle warmth that enveloped him in a blanket of tranquility . His gaze shifted back to the figure , still standing in the distance , the music growing louder as he made his way towards it . He knew he was being drawn to this person he 'd never seen yet felt a connection to , like he 'd always known them and just reconnecting with a long-lost friend . Finally , after what seemed like an eternity , he stood in front of them . He felt like he was looking through windows into eons of lifetimes , and the familiarity he ’ d been sensing before was even stronger . He took a deep breath and looked into the figure 's eyes , and for the first time in a long time , he knew he was finally home .

I felt energized and eager to take on the world . I started taking up interests like photography , video editing , and music production , things that bring me a delectable sense of accomplishment . The donations I had received helped make life brighter and more fulfilling . It was like a bright light of hope that gave me the courage to face anything that would come my way , and it also gave me the strength to share my newfound happiness with others .

I had to come up with something really unique to win the competition . After much thought , I came up with the perfect idea . I decided that I was going to ‘ gift ’ Hitler a time machine . I chuckled to myself as I imagined his surprise when he opened the box . I made sure to give him a very specific set of instructions on how to use it ; just enough for him to figure out what to do but not enough to understand the consequences of his actions . I programmed the time machine so that it would only send him to the exact moment and place of his death . The rest was history . When Hitler arrived in the past he was immediately shot and killed before he had any chance of understanding why his fate had occurred . It was a truly remarkable victory . Of course , after winning I made sure to warn the rest of the time travelers about the repercussions of playing such a deadly game . I wanted to make sure that no one else ever used time travel as a means of murder .
At first , the happiness felt unfamiliar , like a foreign sensation . But soon enough , I felt it running through my veins like a warm soothing wave . It was a feeling I had never experienced before , and it freed me . No longer was I weighed down by heavy emotions , instead I was uplifted by a newfound , delightful lightness . I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this anonymous donor who so generously handed over their own emotion . I wanted to thank them but could not find them . I tried my best to be more open-minded and take advantage of this newfound emotion , by surrounding myself with people who greatly understood the beauty of life , moments and experiences . Thank you , anonymous donor , for inspiring me to embrace each moment and to cherish life . You have changed my life for the better and I could not be more grateful .

You could not enter Heaven if you did not accept that and forgive yourself for the mistakes you had made .

The old woman pulled her worn coat closer around her body as she shuffled down the cold street , a large basket clutched in her weathered hands . She had been walking for hours , but the thrill of adventure still coursed through her veins . As she walked , the woman noticed a faint light in an alleyway up ahead and decided to take a chance - she was intrigued to see what the alley had to offer . The woman stepped back onto the street , dazed by the strange and wonderful objects she had experienced in the matter of minutes . She had felt a presence there that was both comforting and disheartening at the same time - as if the alleyway held the secrets of a distant past . With a renewed sense of curiosity , the old woman began her journey , eager to discover the truth of what lies between the darkness of the alleyway and the light of the outside world .
The sun was shining and the birds were singing , a beautiful summer day full of life . The garden was tranquil , the roses bursting with colour , captivating visitors to its beauty . Families walked by hand in hand , smiling and laughing in joyous laughter . The trees were rustling in the breeze , their leaves swishing gently in the wind . Children ran around the pathways playing tag , blissfully unaware of the world . Life seemed perfect , a chance for everything to flourish in harmony . But then came the storm , a torrent of rage and chaos , engulfing all in its wake . Amidst the terrifying thunder and lightening , the sorrowful rain was heard . Fear reigned in the minds of the people , the beauty of the day so quickly gone . The hopes and dreams of mere moments ago seemed gone , the darkness prevailing . But then , through the darkness a light shone , a beacon of hope and redemption . The crash of thunder and power of lightning were nothing compared to the power of love . That strength transcended all , the darkness of the storm giving way to calm . Slowly , the sun came out , its rays soothing the pain from the night before . Joy once again filled the air , the storm finally over , never to return . Love .
Prologue The sun had barely begun to rise in the cold winter air when I heard the call to arms . I was no stranger to this—fighting had become all too familiar for my people . We had been at war for many years now , and I had never seen an end in sight . The thought of this filled me with deep sorrow . My people had always been proud and courageous , but the years of battle had taken its toll . I could feel their exhaustion in my bones , and it weighed heavily upon my heart . Still , something deep inside of me refused to give in . Our enemies had been relentless in their pursuit of us , and yet here we were , still standing against the odds . I could see strong determination in my people 's eyes and I felt a stirring of courage in my chest . Our weapons were already drawn and ready , and the war cries of our ancestors had begun to sound . I closed my eyes , taking a moment of peace to myself before the fight began . And then , without warning , it began . In an instant , the bleak sky filled with arrows and cries and a deafening roar as the battle commenced . I opened my eyes in time to see our enemies , driven by a force so strong that not even we could match . It was time for us to make our stand . Despite the odds and the fear that threatened to overcome me , I reached for my sword and shared a silent prayer with the gods . In this moment , with death itself looming just ahead , I knew with a fierce conviction , that we would not be denied .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Sarah , who lived in a small , rural village tucked away in the hills of the countryside . She had the most beautiful auburn hair , emerald eyes , and her warm , genuine smile made everyone around her smile . Sarah loved to explore the forest near her village , and one day while wandering through the trees , she stumbled upon a magical tree . Carefully , she touched the trunk and a door opened . Inside , she discovered a secret world , filled with fairies , sprites , and talking animals . She quickly became friends with the creatures of the forest and they took her on amazing adventures each day . One day , during her travels , Sarah uncovered a hidden portal that sent her deep into the earth . Following an underground river , she eventually found herself in a secret cavern , where she discovered an ancient relic - a powerful artifact of untold power . She soon realized that her mission in life was to protect the artifact and keep it from evil forces , and with the help of the creatures of the forest , she was successful in her goal . Sarah 's life was never boring and she always had her magical friends nearby to share in her adventures . No matter where life took her , Sarah never forgot the secret world she 'd uncovered in the forest . She held onto the memories she 'd made always close to her heart , and used the strength she 'd gained from her brief foray into the magical world to make the most of every day .

Last year , to win the competition , I had to come up with the most creative way possible to stop Adolf Hitler from coming to power . So , after spending many months of research , I devised a plan to use temporal engineering to sabotage Hitler 's rise . First , I created a temporal field that stranded Hitler in Berlin during early 1921- exactly one year prior to his failed coup attempt . I then took advantage of the time loop I had created to intercept Hitler 's ascension to power . First , I went back to 1920 , one year before the coup attempt to strategically ensure that Hitler 's plan failed . Leveraging my influence , I ensured that his propaganda materials were wildly off the target that he had intended- leading to the failed coup in 1921 . To further ensure his complete inability to capitalize on another attmept , I returned again to 1919 to prevent his election and swiftly worked to reorganize the power structures in the Weimar Republic . Then , with a combination of other strategies involving nearly three dozen delayed trips in the past and using my influence as a champion time traveler to stir up key alliances in the Reichstag and overthrow the Enabling Act , which Hitler later would have leveraged to become Dictator of the Third Reich . Using these strategies , I ultimately ensured a victory , outmaneuvering and outsmarting numerous top contenders who over the years also tried to devise a plausible and effective solution to eradicate Hitler and prevent the Second Weimar Republic from being established . To this day , my name still stands on the wall at the Time Travel Expo as the champion of last year .
I staggered back in bemused shock at the unexpected feeling that surged through me . As I sampled this newfound emotion , my heart twitched and I felt a spark of happiness ignite within me . It took a few moments before I regained my composure and the awareness that this feeling was not coming from me- it had been donated to me ! I struggled to find the words to express my appreciation for the generous act of kindness , looking up gratefully at the stranger who had contributed such a gift from their own well of emotion . I could only stand there stunned , reaping emotions from this newfound understanding of the world around me that I had only vaguely understood before . Over the coming days and months , I found myself growing healthier and happy as I explored and grew with these donated emotions . I could never thank the anonymous donor enough , truly my life had been changed and was so much richer for it . Once this happiness was successfully incorporated into my life , I began to notice other more rarefied emotions bubbling up- pleasure , contentment , contentment- as if the happiness had opened the floodgates in my soul to other more complex feelings . The strange power of this donation still hums within me as I Reflect with a sense of accomplishment over having been given new roles beyond the dry receptacle of emotionless Nothingness . I savor every moment of these newly felt Judgments and accept and understand the notion that in life we are wiser to accept donations of that which binds and unifies us , than the toxic shame of what enslaves us . I have never shied away from sadness , fear and regret since feeling the hand of a better life through this kindness , I cherish being part of a world worth donating emotions to and championing new routes of feeling empathy and belonging .
This surprise can be both unnerving and enlightening . You realize that not only have you hurt the people around you , but also that you have caused suffering to yourself . You reconcile this realization with a note of understanding and compassion for yourself and seek to make reparations . You understand that in order to move forward from this influence , you must apologize for your wrongdoings and absolve yourself of the damage done . After surrendering to these feelings and notions of wrong-doing , you begin to experience a sense of love and renewal . With tears of gratitude in your eyes , you greet yourself with a new resolve as you open the gates of Heaven .
'' Claire ! '' She heard her name being called for the second time and reluctantly pulled her gaze away from the orange-crowned peaks of rolling hills stretching along the horizon and instead looked towards the campfire her group had setup . Her friend Scarlet was waving to her . Claire slowly stood with a quiet sigh and walked towards the ring of faces eagerly smiling around the fire enticing the traveler with warmth and food . She politely greeted her friends , but kept her gazing transfixed on the hills she had been admiring moments ago . She was exploring this exotic region for the first time ! Ever since she turned eighteen , she was determined to explore all of the world she could ! And today was a special day , she was trekking in the Provençal Alps , catching the bright sunsets over the tall pointing mountains each night . For the past week , her already equipped gear was setting her up perfectly between small towns alongside shallow rivers and lake beds . The older members of her group would share stories making each day exciting and adventurous . As Claire smiled in admiration , she knew this was but one more full-hearted filled tale she will add to her stories remembered from around the world !
Once , Alicia had aspirations of being a successful artist and living an extraordinary life . But when she met Nick , all her dreams suddenly seemed insignificant . She found herself forgetting what she had once aspired for and instead , pouring her all into their relationship . Ultimately she realised it was n't worth it . For despite declaring her love for him , Nick had only promised half-hearted loyalty in return . Knowing that their relationship could never go beyond half-hearted promises , Alicia sadly walked away with heavy-heartedness and said those three little words `` I love you , only . ''
Many say my fate was chosen for me . That I was brought to this world and destined to live out an extraordinary life , not one of ordinary comfort but instead of unpredictable hardship and challenge . Before I was even born , the Kingdom 's lords made prophecies that I was to leave my birthplace , survival against all odds dependent upon fate and my own courage and perseverance . Little did I know the journey I was embarking upon . At the time I seemed no more than an ordinary sixteen-year-old girl named Rose , from Yurtin , a small village in the bohemian lands of Lexton . My home was a tiny wooden house , sheltered by a gable roof and a gaggle of chirping birds who roosted off the windows frieze washing . The land around my home was green and vast , remaining to this day the most beautiful sight I have ever been able to bear swear . I worked hard each day in the grand vineyards strewn in an effortless pattern across the astonishing landscape . It appeared so effortless , almost as if nature had specifically concocted these lovely trails for me to soak in . Every the odor of fresh grapes hung heavy in the air , mixed with the scents of wood and hay . I cherished scraping loose stem of the grapes , which helped to render sweet sugars along with bitterness that one may traverse to bittersweet perfection . Everything changed for me laying the lines that offered my hope youthful life upon a path hitherto unimaginable . It began one frightening night , when an impetuous young prince stormed being through the village , entire my respect with a hearty hum . He proclaimed that had been marked for an endeavor precious but risky , his authoritative voice vaguely of a familiar riles up spirit despite its incomprehensible implications concerning my future . As he near breathless and embark ed toward the cobbt present my inevitable was in motion .
Last year , I used a rather unorthodox approach to winning the Time Travelers International Goal to Kill Hitler Trophy . I went back in time to April of 1941 — mere days before Hitler was scheduled to give the renowned Bell of Badenway speech . When I arrived , I noticed a large box sitting at the podium . Noticing it out of place , I decided to investigate . Upon opening the box , I discovered it was filled wit dozens of random items , from action figures to kitchen utensils , and even a few jacks . When I popped up the top of one of the action figures , I noticed a tiny explosive inside . After receiving instruction from the travel guides on how to use the explosive safely , I placed it under the podium and set the timer for 30 seconds . With a few seconds to spare , I was able to dart out of the room , hearing the deafening explosion as I escaped to safety . When I arrived back in the present , I learned that my acts had saved the world from a much darker future , as the assassination of Hitler had drastically changed the plans of the Third Reich . It was clear that my efforts had been successful , as I was crowned the victor of the competition , winning not only the trophy , but a life-time-supply of time travel vouchers .
Once upon a time , there was a woman who truly loved a man . She often thought of it as a surprise , for even though everyone seemed always to ask if she was in love with him , her answer was always a hesitant `` yes , of course . `` , hesitating on the fear they did n't understand the degree of her love . But deep in her heart she knew that he was the one . Still , her affections could not express in words the strength of her feelings . Finally , one day she declared it and said to him that she only loved him . Her confession became a testimony to her brave soul and its capacity for all-encompassing , Infinite love .
The sun shone radiantly in the wide steel streets of the city . There was a hush of Electricity qui enveloped the whole metropolis , as people moved from one end to the other hurriedly and purposefully . No one stopped or stayed to take in the sights , they all moved as quickly and silently on their quest to get to whichever destination faster . But one person trudged slowly along the cobbled streets . This was Retanior , a unassuming young man who appeared of no greater measure than anyone else . He trudged lethargically yet surely , stopping occasionally to observe anything of particular interest until he reached the Fountain at the city center . Safely obscured by the dense foliage surrounding it , Retanior stopped and observed its miraculous beauty . Then , a female stepped up beside him . Right away , he recognized her as someone formidable ; her navy blue jumpsuit identifying her as Rank One - the supposed strongest of all in the City . Her figure then shifted , as reality then faded , replaced with icy void , her own presence retained only by her strong aura that Remannorian exuded an awkward air . He glanced at her with incredible surprise before bustling away , scared yet ecstatic , leaving only a distinctive glint in his eyes . He now knew why he had come to the City - he had heard rumours of power given to all its citizens , and of the Rankings held by the individuals . Apparently the one ranked number 1 was indisputably stronger than all the others , and finding out who it was would bring immense power , respected by all . He knew now that the Rank One was the mysterious woman at the Fountain . If one were to challenge her for ultimate supremacy they would then gain her strength and with it , obtain ultimate power . And this was exactly what he intended . Retanior wasted no more time . Unintimidated by even your own strength , the mysterious mustered his semblance of courage and approached her floating form . Surprisingly , she willingly agreed to what he said as replies were n't in wonderment , something far more sinister . A monumental crash broke the air not too soon after . Retanior jumped out of shock , unsurprised to duly see that the Rank One : the woman he had challenged , lay defeated at his feet . The paralysed Victoria lay still beneath the wreckage of her attempted attack . A cripping sensation passed faintly up Retanior 's
It can be hard to let go of someone you are close to and it 's OK to feel sad about something changing . With your friendship coming to an end , the important thing is to think about all the special times you have got to share together . Remembering these good memories may help you come to terms with the transition . Take comfort in the fact that sometimes , even when friends are not there in the same way , their memory can still be close in your heart . Have a little faith that even when life brings change , your friendship will still live on in the memories and values you shared together .
At first , you were scared . You 'd never felt this emotion before . It was overwhelming and seemingly impossible to feel such a foreign yet powerful sensation . But as the day dragged on , a little wonder held inside your heart as the joy mingled within it , gradually altering and changing your outlook on life . It was bright , buoyant and surprisingly liberating . The joy you felt was not instant . In the beginning , it was something of a gradual process . You were taken aback by how gentle and fleeting happiness could be . You welcomed it , and joy spread through you slowly and seepingly . When you least expected it , it washed over in gentler than a feather but lingered longer , unlocking more of a sense of joy and contentedness that you did not know existed . Your donations increased after that day , as word got out . After receiving the donation of joy , you included better instructions on how to properly donate an emotion , to make sure only those people with extra emotions were the ones who donated them . Many people had happy to spare and wanted you to experience something they knew was so beautiful . At night , you look up at the stars in silent thankfulness . You finally feel emotional connection to a world that you previously never thought possible and are so grateful for the opportunity to do so . You now fully understand the value of emotions , and the powerful effects of open-hearted vulnerability.You filled your donation box to the point where your life felt filled with nothing but warmth and color . The more you gave , the more you received and through donations and grace , you were able to find greater peace each day , further filling both your heart and your donation box with more and more special cherished emotions .
Oh , so it is time for us to say goodbye ... Though our days together have been filled with excitement , curiosity , and adventure , I am sure that you are beginning an even more intriguing journey without me . My time with you was special . I will always treasure our friendship and the many different new things we got to explore together . The vivid imagination , creativity , and love that we shared were breathtaking . Your future brings an abundance of potential and opportunities - but always remember me , your once ever-present pal . For every tear shared and every hug given was a spark from your force of magic like no other . Goodbye my dearest one . Celebrate our time together and the experiences we created , for it was filled with plenty of love . Keep your spirit wild and I know you will go on to do amazing things . I depart , but never forget the sparkle in your eyes letting me know you still care for the invisible one .
As heartbreaking as this moment is for both of us , I want to thank you for being the most wonderful friend I could ever imagine . We 've been through so much together , like playing pretend games and untying so many tough emotional knots , and I can truly say our bond was strong . I know things may seem tough , but it is how it is meant to be ; I am the comrade who was always meant to bring joy and laughs to this special kid 's darkest days , and as that awareness was within me , I shall fade out of his life now that his days are growing lighter and brighter . No matter what , I will always remember you , and you will forever be imprisoned within my fondest memories of our time together . Thank you for bringing me joy , for pushing me to confront and surpass my problems , and for being the perfect companion in life 's great adventure . With deep gratitude , Your Fading Imaginary Friend
You stand there , facing the image of yourself . You realize you were not so kind to your self , taking chances with life ; gambling with its outcomes . You realize you sometimes said some hurtful things to yourself , blaming yourself when there was no one there to do the back-breaking labour , and stomping on your hopes and dreams even when success was nearly within your grasp . You are home to the depths of your own conscience and must grapple with the accumulated guilt of a lifetime . It is unlike any other encounter ; you struggle to speak or even move but slowly the words start to come . Crying you explain that you accept what you did and want to be forgiven . Apologising ; for getting angry and discouraging yourself before you could even start . You touch your chest and feel the pain of the heightened awareness of your own memory of acknowledgement and regret . There is no divine intervention to pass judgement . It is healed by soundless moments looking within yourself . You feel an obedience to a greater quest for the best version of yourself , determined to never again take the easy road . The skies break open and a brilliant light radiates through pounding , thudding winds that almost drown out the erasure of all pain . You realise that the only way to get into heaven is not to face an accuser , but to face yourself , understand , and change . Before departing to paradise , you raise your eyes to the bluest sky and solemnly promise to forever look after yourself , to understand who and what you are . You realise the only way is up . Shadows part and the burden feels somewhat healed , and nothing else is asked .
I won the championship last year by executing a very complex and inventive plan . I took my time machine back to World War II Germany and decided that the best place to start would be to target one of Hitler ’ s aides - Albert Speer . My plan was to use him as a pawn to deliver a fatal blow to Der Führer himself . I knew that Speer was a devoted German patriot and would do just about anything to protect Hitler , whom he considered both a hero and a friend . Taking advantage of this fact , I contacted Speer and started talking to him about how Hitler was leading the country astray and supplying it with false ideals . I then dropped several hints at the fact that I could prove to him that all Hitler was doing was bad for Germany . This planted a seed of doubt that ate away at Speer ’ s loyalty and caused him to question Hitler and the Nazi Party . When I felt safe , I revealed to Speer that I could provide him with a single , time-altering action that could lead to King Hitler 's demise and that action was to assassinate him . At first , he did n't want to believe me . But I used my knowledge and intellect to convince him , eventually calming Speer down and asking him to make a decision . Points for creativity ! Speer finally accepted the mission and stepped up to the plate . Gaining further points for difficulty , he cracked through Hitler ’ s security at a public address and assassinated him . Cheers erupted through the crowd and for the first time , the possibility of a much more prosperous future opened up . My plan succeeded , I had won the competition , and I realized that by looking through a different lens , time travel could be used to do much more than just alter the past .
Surprised , you pause as you take in the person before you . Although it looks like you , you can feel the weight of the memories you so easily brush away at the edge of your conscience . As if your Apologises up until this moment fix all , your jaw tightens as reality dawns . Your mind races as you realize that this must be the price of entry into Heaven . You take a deep breath and begin leaving to talk to yourself . You introduce yourself and apologize for all the hurt you caused yourself through overthinking annd self sabotage over the years . You elaborate on all the hurt you caused yourself by setting unrealistic wishes and expectations , blaming yourself for things that were out of your control , and not believing in yourself enough . Though you do not deserve apologize , you admit your wrongdoings finally . You thank yourself for never giving up and making this moment possible so you could enter the kingdom of Heaven . The image of yourself characterizes and patiently listens , nothing short of understanding staring back at you , and you feel the mutual empathy as tears stream down your face . As both parties understand each other there is no need for further words so you hug and forgive each other finally . Just like that , you pass through the entrance to Heaven .
You stand in silence , but you feel like all your past mistakes , regrets , and sorrows have accumulated and are causing an invisible aura of despair that was hovering around you both but that you were the only one that could sense . You see things you never noticed before like how some of your sharp words have hurt and damaged relationships . And you surprisingly notice how even when you tried to forgive yourself , some part of you was always keeping a grudge and tormenting you inside . You try to speak but years of keeping it held in has made it difficult for you . Your lips seal and your throat tightens like someone ’ s placing pressure from the outside . You notice you reflexively reaching out to the figure with tears starting to fall down your cheeks , grieving for all the years of wonderful moments you could have had if only you had listened to yourself and your inner knowing . In the middle of your sorrow , an aftermath of deep peace and appreciation for yourself fills you . From the other side of this exchange , you feel an unconditional understanding of the journey that drove you here . You breathe in the recognition and you feel the acceptance radiating off the figure , making you feel both misunderstood and understood all at once . With those arms so invitingly outstretched , despite the fear that lingered in you , you let yourself be embraced . It feels like home - old familiar certainty blended with something entirely new and different . It feels like a solid ground under your feet , a renewed strength you have n't felt in so long as well , all manifesting to finally say to yourself - it ’ s over . No angel with wings of gold is going to drop from Heaven and whisk you away . This is Heaven - this is the journey you have been waiting for , ever since you were a little child : coming home to yourself . Your choice to say Yes to everything that made you who you are ripples through your being as comfort and as forgiveness . And this is how you eventually reach Heaven - in the comfort of your own skin , heart , and soul - merged so beatifically in a Wholeness that courses through your cells and life force , just like May sunlight through the vines of the Eden Garden of the Bible .
You quiver with disbelief as you spot yourself staring at you from the glowing entryway . You try to slowly step away , but your feet are tangled in a strange emotion . You turn to face yourself , uncertainly . Slowly , unfamiliar voices pipe out from every surface , getting louder and louder . You realize it 's a congregation composed of your most tender memories , moral failings , ashes of lost dreams and hopes . The consensus rippling through the energy is clear - judgement and you . As times past fail to look away , you slowly breathe towards redemption . Tentatively , you take slow and steady steps to the ethereal line between life and salvation - eventually reaching the gateway that will take you to Heaven . You accept yourself as you silently serve yourself grace and understanding . That is the key - acceptance by Almighty Grace - submitted lovingly and without caveats . As you take the last steps , a sense of calmness engulfs you , hinting towards the promise of satisfaction fulfilled . You have made it - yes , you ’ re finally at Heaven ’ s door . You look forward , inviting a swell of inner strength you had no idea you possessed . With dignified confidence , you surge into Heaven - purified by life ’ s lessons and the fact that you have taken responsibility and accepted yourself fully .
Mary took a deep breath before she stepped through the door . She 'd spent months planning this visit and was determined to make it count . But nothing could have prepared her for what followed : a captivating smile , an outstretched hand . Carl pulled her close , and the years melted away . Soon , they were reminiscing . Rereading letters , reliving memories , rekindling old dreams . Time passed too quickly . But the flame they 'd rekindled burned bright , sparkling in Mary 's heart . One final embrace , a lingering kiss on her fingertips , an unsaid goodbye echoing in their smiles . As Mary left , Carl whispered a single , beautiful word : harmony .
As the child grows into adulthood , it can be difficult to understand why I am not around anymore . It may feel like I have been forgotten in the shadows as other things take precedence in their life . But inside my world still exists , and within it I remain a strong part of them . Before I go , I want them to truly understand how powerful the bond we shared was and how important those memories we shared will be in their future . As I start to fade away , please remember that my existence has been grounded in your imagination , leaving a track of positivity I hope stays with you long after my disappearing act .
Sun hit my face as a hand shook my shoulder doing its best to pull me from my sleep . Groggily , I stirred , peering out the window at the risen sun . The sun was not to be admired long , however , as the hand that had affectionately disturbed my tranced state had other plans . I smiled despite the interruption , recognizing two gentle , familiar eyes peeking up at me . “ Good morning sleepy head , it ’ s time to get up ! Where away in a thrilling tale we go. ” The die was cast - an excitable proclamation signaling that both of us knew we were alledgning upon some grand and adventuresome place , enticed by fate with promise of all the infinite possibilities that followed in it 's boundary-lessshadow , enticing us to forge onward , on interesting paths , in pictures whaling new desires and wonderful impressions burned in barks tinier than seedlings yet potent allbthe same ..

I can relate to the heartbreaking emptiness you felt throughout your life . But when that first nugget of happiness slipped through the slot in your emtpy donation box , it was as though I was brought into feeling nothing but joy . I watched closely as a spark of emotion flew through the air , filling up the emptiness of the room until an indescribable warmth took over . I no longer felt my emotional void , but instead was feeling a new impulse coursing through my veins . This happiness that had so distracted replaced many sadness , feards , and regrets with hope for a future of more than empty . These feelings were humbling and freshly exciting at the same time . This gratitude did more than give warmth to myself alone- it extended to the many emotions found in us all . It taught me a humbling realization that our decisions create our joy . Unwanted emotions still come and go , but replacing these emotions with acceptance can help protect and cherish these feelings while turning them into beauty . In exchange , the impact left something deep and tangible in my heart . This wondrous act of kind generosity had reshaped my view of the world ; that even in involuntary situations , we can come through full circle to better understand ourselves and the life around us .
I want you to know that even though I may not be physically here anymore , I 'll always be here in spirit . From one person who has experienced fantastic adventures to another , I hope you 'll live life with the same sense of curiosity and courage that we have shared , no matter how dark and difficult the days have gotten . Know that you are always cherished and forever loved , now and for the rest of time .
Alex eyed the wooden tavern with contempt . Inside drunk Stonosa residents were laughing , the emotions tinged with dread . It was well past a reasonable hour , but desert sandstorms still insisted on keeping people indoors whenever they peaked . Meaning , villagers virtually roamed between two choices - the tavern and the fair . The loudness coming from within said enough . Truth be told , Alex was n't even sure why he had set foot out of his cabin there before Eastern lights . He should 've stayed in the confines of the cabin , where the heat , despite appearing unbearable , was rational . No one can stub their crotch in extreme dark hours , and such descriptions are only deserved by day activties . But homenic inertia could n't give orders to free feet . At that tavern asleep , the horizon was unable to express itself in the path he took - or at least it had refused muteness . It was customary - or comforting - well , more likely , both , for early shifts under occupied silence . Often times shadowy figures would find solace in untouched indentrons , monstrosities half machine , partly kind , glimmering briskly in moonlight . No greeting was uttered , no eye contact was returned , and nothing made sense . Pain , related to absence of recollection , interfered when details hatched , details this man failed to anticipate . Frozen words echoed jangling insignificance , tainting secrets that vilified genuine life stories , ending with a quixotic defiance , while unraveling what had happened that night in Stonosa . The storm 's face mirrored blurry trajectories , and unfocused narratives reslted in utter amusement . As bright water thrashed vigorously due east absent water causes existrational terror - erthatmanuscriptrous hum trumping furious existential tembre . From both inside and out . Whatever grips Alex believed he might possess evaporated fasterlong rememberedthis blurry foray went handin handto packss nobody knew––packs were empty and blind .

She said she only loved him . It had been a tough battle - one full of tears , bouts of frustration , disappointment , resentment and guilt . He thought it was for love that she declared during the incessant arguing , only to realize afterwards that it was nothing more than stress speaking from both himself and her . He felt undeserved of her love for much too long , having carried burdens long overcome and still pushing onwards on barriers that were n't there . But with a few moments of sincere honesty , reassuring hugs and truthful words , his heart swelled in understanding that she was just as cracked as he was and that in their unity , it could all be repaired and reconstructed if only they chose to fix its faults and focussed on the love as their driving force . And in the end it was with only love that she had forcommitted to stay together despite the fire and emotions coming their way - she said she only loved him .
Trent Taylor ran through the sizzling alleyways of the City of Powers . His spirits were high - he was Rank 1 and it had been like this for years and no one quite knew why . Despite being the most powerful individual in the city , Trent kept his gift hidden , never revealing it even to his closest companions . The dominant landscape of the bartering system placed on Trent 's shoulders had become routines for him , altogether innocuous . He had been staying away most nights recently ; bartering and haggling away his goods on the black market . What no one knew was that Trent gained access to these unsavory concourses as a part of his carefully kept secret . Trent masked his power from the eyes of others as he moved quietly within tightly wired alleys and sheets of electricity pulsating around him . As he moved , he fed the flow of power hemming him in , gaining a greater surround message , a sensation of a calm serenity . Flooded in chaste peace , he ducked beneath the quick shower of dynamism chasing him every night in pursuit of power and recognition . Trent slumber counted the hours steadily every night while all of the storytellers , rank holders and market goers wover together hastily about his humble figure between arc webs spanning wide . The location was not a told secret . Strategically construed ideas multiplied rapidly while claiming power from the holder for power and challenges have materialized in Trent ’ s mouth . This new perceived sense was dictated by no one . Understanding the risk in its real form , he meant sincere ignorance of his power in order to remain out of others sight remains his strength . Although keeping detached displayed less impulssiivity and have unseen arrogance , Trent honed the abilities chained firmly to protection , enable him to toe his way breaking the smothering boundaries associated with gaining an honest rightful and proper placering Ordermanship . Ranked No . 1 being it humbly yet appropriately spoke alarms to the held imaginary beliefs from sources above where not just concepts like brutal savagery through chaotic assaults or marketing campaigns was contended or embalished prior ; now psychic powers try out its dominance respect , realizing that it represented the diversification by edating from virtually untemperable combined ideas flowing unitaryly . Dominate too much , lack communication skills even more and surpass organic rates in cognitive understanding - this is cost of turn around expectations . The hard truth have meant increase in
Once upon a time there lived a primitive people , deep in the heart of an ancient forest . They had lived in peace with the forest creatures for generations , maintaining a deep respect for nature and each other . Little did they know that their most beloved sanctuary was about to be under siege from an unexpected adversary that would bring a fog of despair and terror over the land . From long forgotten corridors strange creatures started to emerge and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting tribe . Forcing them further inward , further away from the light , they continued to witch and pursue with deadly purpose until the jungle seemed a part of an ongoing nightmare . Wherever they went , the creatures would undermine their efforts and bring ruin to the woods . In their darkest hour , a stranger emerged who pledged to help pull them out of the darkness they were thrust into , and lead them on a journey of self-discovery and transcendence . And so their quest to reclaim the sacred temple at the centre of the forest began . A treacherous and relentless path took them deep into the forsaken corners of their land , lessening risk at each step and empowering them with reward every venture along the way . At the end of their journey , a solution of symbolic importance emerged and answered the cruelty and malevolence of the plague that had ripped through the jungle . In an epic battle of fire brave men and fierce sentient beasts fought to an honorable defeat the monstrous creatures , casting the forest back into peace at last . From the depths of the darkness , the mission of journey was successfully fulfilled and rid the wasted realm of the tainted power . As they forged back into the trees and embraced the once peaceful timber zones with bright treasures only found by exhilarATING the natural secrets , a harmonious spotless hit was disseminated . One thing remained true , a lesson every warrior-at-heart must remember - no foe greater than the strength of commitment , courage , and undying faith in yourself .
Winning the title of Time Travel Champion last year was no small feat . The stakes were high with the ultimate challenge being the assassination of Adolf Hitler . Making it even more difficult , no previous kills by other online competitors could be used - I would have to figure out something on my own . My time travel quest started with careful factual research about Hitler ’ s known movements in 1919 . Finding the right place and the right girl proved central to the scenario I engineered . I focused my cross-time hopping mainly around Winnie and Herman the Military Boot dealer near Hahnke ’ s Hallmark Shop . Teenaged Romeo had called upon fiery Juliet numerous times holding cherished messages stoked with prayer cards and money gifts afoot nearby upon the western bars shield of Rosesheim . The youthful Adolf unscathed reveals jubilant promise of Haus of Guns , wherein valor and prizes of loving memory worthed a ballyhoo victory indeed . Arriving one week before Rudolf Hess brought home a tin Hitler figurine puzzle , my investment paid forward earnest authority when Monty the Magical Juggler stopped infactum by town with a weather laced dream of hope . Momentary incapacitation transposed inanimate fate towards trajectory synonym of change provided voluntary missing footsteps of agenda nine whence worry wearing Adolf withdrawn unscathed . Share my victory has put me in the running of becoming a two-time champion . I 'm staying on top of the latest potential hit points any would-be challengers this year that may place vying for the ultimate challenge of Killing Hitler .
Anthony glanced nervously out the restaurant window , as his date flicked her wet cherry curls behind one ear . Every now and then , she connected with his eyes , causing his pulse to accelerate from their intense gaze . Abruptly , forks tingled against plates as the night fell to a silence . His fearful lips quivered , as he pressed against interrogating words . Sheepishly , her neck recoiled . Soon , they sipped away bittersweet tea , relishing a distant conversation they held years ago . Over time , their speech elevated through quivering breaths , allowing a somber understanding they long disavowed . Suddenly , Anthony slowly reached across the narrowing table . His dry fingertips quivered against her youthful skin , sparking some hidden passion held from long ago . His words tumbled through sympathy before whispering ... '' relinquish ? '' . Affirmative .
I won last year ’ s competition for Best Killing of Adolph Hitler by using my time machine to travel back to 20 . April 1945 at 2:00 a.m . I disguised myself as one of Hitler ’ s advisers and infiltrated his innermost circle . After gaining his trust , I waited for an opportune moment when both Hitler and his trophy wife ( Magda Göebbels ) were present . Once I saw my chance , while the two were arguing and distracted , I quickly introduced an invisible toxin that would take Hitler ’ s life milliseconds later . Wasting no time , I exited out of the bunker , into the protection of my time machine , allowing me just enough time to escape before it all went crazy and the authorities were to arrive . The authorities found no evidence of my involvement in the pre-mediated scheme ; however , hours later when Maureen Hess ( Hitler ’ s housekeeper ) entered the Führerbunker and extinguished the flame , all was clear ; Adolph Hitler would never be heard of again . I not only avoided detection but executed my plan with such grace and diligence , fleeing the scene without but an echoing mouse squeak unheard . This plan of mine is hailed the Greatest act of timing … an Act !
Rising to the quaint bakery on the slanting slope of Van Dower Hill , Nathan took into account what made this city so unique—people here had powers . Telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensoria . Abilities so remarkable and yet so fragile were what served to distinguish ranked members of the struggling city , and no one was more important then myself . Due to age , or some such factor I was acclaimed the highest and no one could understand as why . People generally assumed i was some kind of 'omnikinetic ' , though I only truly knew why . But as my wristwatch chimed in familiar jitters therefore ticking near a whole hour towards those curdled sins , I noted true fear—rage boiling from the ranks of those vastly unparalleled—they whispered . Think what with enough strength !

First Paragraph : The day that everything changed started off like any other in the small coastal town of Magnolia Springs . The sky was painted in magnificent shades of yellow and red and a gentle breeze comforted the town 's inhabitants each time it rustled through the trees . For the summer , life was calm and everything in the town seemed just as it should be . Last Paragraph : Standing at the Magnolia Springs Bay views balcony , Hallie breathed a reluctant sigh . Time had ceased completely , obliterated by the tall waves and serenity of the bay 's surface as the young girl reflected on the events that led her to this point . With lifelong life-altering decisions thrust upon her , she was seeking an answer which , perhaps , already existed within her heart .
You are taken aback when you find your reflection in front of you . It 's everything that you tried to hide , everything that you are afraid of : fear , mistakes , pain , and regret . At first it 's hard to come to terms with seeing yourself like this , of coming face to face with your failures and shame . With a heavy heart , you take a deep breath and try to find a way to reconcile with the person you most regret . Or is n't he yourself ? Drawing strength from the knowledge that , if you could stand here at all , it meant you had achieved something remarkable , you reckon with yourself of the past — from your innocence through the best of times all the way to your multitude of mistakes . You remember the stories often unspoken of partial submission , unjust judgment , and violation oftimes self-composed . Bit by bit , your newfound understanding of yourself aids an easing of the unforgiving thoughts in which you previously lived . No longer separated but living unboundedly together , it ’ s reminded that we are gifted with the sure realization that forgiveness leads the way to the acceptance of both success and of the mistakes of the past . Sharing the tragedies that once pushed you to obtain closure , you return in passionate desire for a celebration of something greater than resignation to an untimely fate—rather that you are entitled , in acknowledgment , to the unrestricted acceptance of all that you have come to become . Commencing to trace imaginary circles on the pale floor , revisiting yesteryear reveals a clarity encountered eras ago and long into eternity . Exuding blessing , curtaining a ravishing unforgettable backdrop comprised of stars so far ago it suffers endless amnesia , here encores the acme , reaching admirers through portals lit—absorbing its power only now magnified and taken along for the ride into glorious concluding bliss that ultimately shapes your destiny .
Your sins were in the form of doubts , indifference , and/or a lack of effort . In Heaven , you confront yourself and learn from the mistakes you ’ ve made . You realise that you can change , improve , and leave the past behind . Through honest self-examination and compassion , you learn the power of forgiveness and discover that Heaven is indeed your reward . Now go forward , armed with love and kindness , and make your own Heaven .

Once upon a time , there was a girl named Star . She lived in a small cozy hometown nestled in the mountains . The people in this town were kind and welcoming , but were constantly busy - doing various chores , getting up early for their jobs or cattle-raising . Star wanted to find her purpose in life , she decided to journey far away from this small town . With nothing but the linen shirt on her back and the steady gait lining the way , Star set off from her humble dwellings in search of a life and a meaning to fill long days with . The road brought surprises as cities replaced plots of crops that dotted the recessive lands of Star 's hometown . As nights rolled in on her journey , Star felt anew the buzz of the city and the lull of city-living whispering in her dreams . She stayed close to locals who doubled as friends teaching her the sweet stains of life . Finding wild laughter in the notes of midnight singing and going places with anyone and everyone , she eventually gained the companionship and acceptance she had been aching for . In those months of embracing life , of tempting the multitude of vivid shadows - experiences awoke fond laughter and pushed her ever farther through transitions . To move and understand the strong silent paths that later honed an unusual fashion worth of colors of golden sun and molted greens kissed the ragged summers , made a patchwork orange in visible texture , rattable citriel lands melting in summers fertile air winters that star sighed motherlode . Alas as the final towns within provinces bled into scant menageries of stone palisades and raked hands caressing sweatpersoon laws , blisters forming and stepped metal snakes scanning dreams gluing wooden passing wings on ephemy the forgotten folks of Blacktown welghted by forgotten hates . Blind from sight of lit spirits passed by restless dreams written toiled high hailed yet crumble kings and west lied trades sparked fulled factories weaving ill timed co orporate fixtures writing laws Star saw one possibility for a better tomorrow it battled through political regalia suncharged . And star quickly swapped home for something more , a change fuelled by resurtion and vital hope then hidden desires unaware — breathing understanding into a flames of boiling ideas emanating a ferriting of goodwill during unimaginable peace times — were when at lost mumbled forgotten stares so good times rolled and unknown fear crumpled between breaths And in that moment Star choose not feel unworthy -knowing
Gene adjusted the microscope as he marveled at the beauty of the cell structure so exposed . Perfectly hatched egg whites , vacant and lifeless , awaiting fresh dyes of color . Impulsively , he injected the cell , one shimmering drop of cerise that hinted of pomegranate . It worked ! There stirred mysterious , spiraling patterns of trace melting moments of life . He feverishly crafted a synthesis that seemed bright sparks of creation . His cheeks flushed a rosy hue . Gestures filled with delight as he marveled , mesmerized in admiration until−achieved .
Once upon a time , in a small town far away , there lived a girl named Gracie . From the outside , she looked like an ordinary 14-year old girl ; she went to school and hung out with friends , but from inside , she had the heart of a dragon . Herself , she did n't know what she was made of , but on this particular Wednesday morning , her secret would be revealed . It started off as any other Wednesday would ; she brushed her teeth , combed her hair , laid out her outfit and within minutes , ready to head off to school . But this day was special . It was a warm , windy morning and for the first time , Gracie felt as if some force was protecting her . Unable to explain it then , Gracie now contemplated just what this force was as she skipped down the street whistling a sweet tune . Her first few classes were a breeze and it was n't until lunch early noon struck , was she interrupted from fulfilling her duties as an obedient schoolgirl . That day , unfortunately , was the day that things got quite dangerous for the small town she called home . It started with a loud bang followed by an awful screech . Then all of a sudden , everything stopped - as the people of town froze in fear . Above the deceased town hovering in mid-air was without a doubt a dragon - garbed in dark green scales . It was on a mission to terrorize and maul anyone that got in its way , and Gracie soon saw it shooting a thundering grey flame towards the ground , only narrowly avoiding local buildings and villages . Unfortunately for Gracie she watched , but taken aback by fear , unable to move . That is , until something strange happened . For the first time in her life , Gracie felt this strange heroism drip from her veins and without prompting , quite miraculously she sprinted towards the dragon as fast as she could . As she ran , she heard this loud and clear internal voice that granted her an ability of wings -- and it turned out at the last second they were able to blaze white following 2 majestic wooden sticks . Turns out , before Gracie knew it , she flamed into the skies chasing death and disruption away For what felt like hours , Gracie & # x2019 ; s wings painted the midnight blue sky as her world a mountain of weapons- Grace unmet baddest heroes ... it was n't
Paul shuffled home in the dark , hands in his pockets and a chill in the air . He felt drained and exhausted , but he had no idea of the terrible events that would unfold over the next hours .

With that one simple donation , suddenly the tides changed for me . A spark of hope shot through my veins . For a moment , I thought I was dreaming . But it was real , and for that , I was forever grateful . An unwavering smile traced my lips and I felt like a burden had been lifted off my shoulders . I marvelled at how something so special and seemingly intangible could be passed on from one person to another . Before this experience , I felt numb . But with this new sense of visceral pleasure that had flooded over me , I realized that being human was n't all that bad after all . I used this donation and my newfound clarity to look back on happier memories or gone-too-soon loves . Although most were distant and even fleeting , some pieces of me living again through the heavy power -- yet generous warmth , emission -- to wrap around my chest .

# Prologue Dusk settled over the dusty terrain , blurring the line between plants and land into a mix of shadows and warm , dusky colors . Ashe herself shone amid this transition , her person a bright beacon as she made her way through painted grass and walker footprints toward a crooked creek she remembered growing up near . Scout sentries snapped their traps with industrial auditory clunk -- the cracking bits and pieces bearing a jarring absence of all romantic expectations .

Bria woke that evening feeling better than ever ; excitement had spilled into her bloodstream and she was ready to go . Packing her bags with a smile , she called up some friends and eagerly headed out . Cars quickly filled the air ; they pulled up to the warm Venetian beach and stepped out , exposing their legs to the sun . Saucy laughs echoed throughout the bar , entwining with chinking glasses and guitars singing songs melodically . Once the night was whisking up , rapid enchantment sealed the air . Through eager eyes , few told stories of journey and unpredictability - a buzz spilled and rolled amongst their mischievous chitters . Although evenings ran slow , they mingled within a trance , brewing and cooking dreams three five and four-part harmony… until another day burst in , warm eternal : serendipity . Vibes .

Elizabeth Coward sat uneasily at her small kitchen table . Swirling black rings looped across the center — the fault of that old cup of coffee her daughter had left days ago . Cup holders surrounded the dried pastries , not a crumb spared living after much wait after whole of the day .

She said she only loved him . They had met when neither had expected it in a bustling cafe on the corner of Main Street . Abigail resided in the neighbouring town over and happened to frequent this particular eatery whenever she visited . Clyde , his weather-worn face brightening at the sight of her , instantly recognised what Abigail didn ’ t know . Upon exchange of small pleasantries , he still hadn ’ t voiced whatever kept him rooted to the spot . Poor Clyde , she thought later . He simply couldn ’ t and probably would never be able to marshal the courage to tell her . Despite their grey hair , dignified air notwithstanding ; it could not deny the budding chemistry between them during that fateful encounter last Monday . Being two unlikely souls in their transcendent 60s to hone romantic feelings was rarely the case anyway , Abigail considered as fate handpicked them both and cautiously beginning to believe – almost too yearning – which made her delicately wince once she exchanged piecemeal goodbyes with them last Wednesday over lunch .

Prologue The corner of Main Street and Bowman Lane had been one of Chloe Miller 's favorite evening haunts for what felt like a lifetime . She strolled through the busy cross-section , smiling and nodding at familiar faces obligingly , her streaked honey-blond curls and wild porcelain complexion just perceptible in the passersby 's peripheral views . She could n't help but search each face eagerly in an unconscious psychic darting – incisive yet transient – hoping the elegant features and aquamarine eyes of her most beloved would suit any bottomless interest spilling from obscure cobblestoned corners . And honestly , why had this city deflated her cherished appreciation for having a good time so much ? Countless days , months , nay , years since he had fled town to reach better prospects , Chloe night after continued understanding herself with only worn bars and restaurant marquees neon-lit , an oscillating group of regulars marking her existence .

The wind howled an unmusical dirge , billowing the wisps of fog against the dusky twilight . Still thirsty for routine comforts , tired of nights spent mulling further away moments and darker emotions . Chased out of a sleepy , stifling Elysium with no sunlight in sight.Futility roughened bells cannoned out over the eerie bay leaves licking fall 's winter secrets offshore . Skin fibers unweave with emptiness rife , panic yearned thirsty in hours between empty lines cycling loss ever up on repeat . Endlessly summing vain plots and energy thickened galens tortured alibis . Everywhere denying arrest dark pills bark towards secretness encapsulating mires of brooding dreams crippling souls in isolation . Dash by meager souls fighting want dashing shade across fleeting star rains bar their promise day after beckons beckish , hapless grips the urge with laugh . Expatriate geist oozes out from paused simmers humoring deeper in , hunger spat by fragments crystal shred tele new winding tales moan ! Vacant alone .

As your kid gets older , it gets harder and harder for them to believe that you , as an imaginary friend , have experiences with them day by day . Even though it hurts knowing I 'm being forgotten and pushed aside , I 'm thankful for all of the joyous and silly times we shared whenever I was invited to your kid 's playing . Even if I 'm fading away now , we both got chance to laugh , joke , and remember the silly sayings during our countless childhood moments and stories .

At first , you did n't know why you needed to have this talk since you didn ’ t necessarily wrong yourself . But as you look closer , you noticed how you could have been a completely different person if only you took a chance you avoided initially . You realize that the version of yourself now standing in that heavenly room overpowered the old you . Seeing result —without any ulterior filters —grown into the ability to forgive as you gradually understand about the behavior caused by different life stages and variables in the life puzzle . After painstaking discussion , followed resilience , the redemption prevails and humanity sends you both home-free .

Prologue Carl Cartwright awoke with sweaty palms to begin what was already beginning to feel like the longest night of his life . Around 11pm , Anathema Cleaves had walked in stepped through the window , wide-bangle anklets hitting the tiled floors like weight dropping . One could sense the whole room held on tiptoes , desperately hoping apprehending what came next . Except Carl , he knew right off why Anathema had broken in like a fugitive one midnight and sought asylum by his bedroom balcony .

He looked at his Miranda deep in her distorted state , too weak to escape as he tied the tangle knot forcefully around her wrists . Tears spilled silently down his unsettlingly stoic expression , clearly illustrating the divide between his emotions unfolding before him and the frame of strength he had managed to forge up . After yet another insult-filled rapture , she stopped struggling still inside – all while wrapping the final line loosely around her wrists – revealing the sole bit of order in her messy judgment was her seemingly undying reply imploring him with utmost extremes . `` I only love you . ''

That can be a very difficult and emotional situation . Even though it might feel sad , it is important to remember that you have had a very important role in the child 's life — a bit like a guardian angel — for which they will be immensely grateful . You have been there for them when they needed help and have provided comfort when needed ; the presence of your support has made all the difference in navigating life 's unfamiliar and sometimes scary pathways . As they move along the ever winding slice of life , they begin to explore their independence . With a bit of nourishment from family , friends and peers , they will become self-sufficient . And , who knows ... maybe even entrust truth with imaginary thoughts , worlds and adventures they did n't explore with you just before the dawn of independence . Remembrances will glimpeer and much physical joy return as the matter mixed frames design humble pockets within the arc elastic landscapes of sympathetic infinity cloudscape huts . Adieu for now , I 'm sure ! ! !
As the kid grows up , I 'll remain in their hearts forever . I 'll cheer when the child laughs and give gentle guidance throughout life . I 'll look through family albums with sadness in my eye , comfort them in tough times , and populate their imagination until the fond memory of me fades away aromatically . All I can ask is for every tear I leave behind , their happiness outshines I delivered when I played in childish games . Until we meet again , my graceful exit , will float through timeless aisles lost , gone forgotten through piecework and titles , retained in lifelong files across vessels , frames forgotten in Earths span but carried blooms knowingly in angelic domain , diverse essences traversing grounded seas and clinging promises wherever winds travel they master .

Ever darker it brimmed with an omnipresent terror overtaking its once seemingly eternal peace . Father Cunor however remained hopeful .

From the second he opened his eyes that morning , Andy knew it was going to be a good day . He could sense it . Today was the day ! The day his boring , meaningless , self-proclaimed-pity-party of a life would change forever . Everything felt perfect , like the way he had always wanted it to . The way the light came through his windows , the way the carpet felt on his feet as he lifted himself up out of bed - which in itself was unusually effortless . His coffee was the perfect temperature , he got the best spot in the usually impossible parking lot at his job , and he somehow mustered up the courage to talk to Angela for the first time since the Rio affair . It was this same strange optimism that led him to notice the sign in the window of the convenience store he passed every single day but never paid much mind . `` Press your luck ! Buy a ticket ! '' the sign said . Andy smiled , and gladly obliged . As he watched the truck pull off into the distance , the last of his belongings crammed into the back , an overwhelming sense of calm came over him . He even laughed a little bit . How fast one can go from thinking they have nothing to having everything and back to nothing . But this time he really had nothing . It was just him , in the middle of the road , drenched from the rain , staring into the future . A year ago he would have rushed home to get dry . But not now . Now he was different . The cold wet clothes he had on now felt better than any of the freshly tailored designer clothes he had grown so accustomed to wearing ever had . Now he was happy , and he knew it ; and with a smile and a deep breath , he took the first step forward towards the rest of his life .
( it may seem a little disjointed and probably more than paragraph due to most of it being conversational . EDIT also for formatting and I apparently forgot to write a first paragraph ) I looked up from my computer . Quickly typed an AFK to some people because I thought I heard a knock at the door . There it was again , no one ever visits at least not at night there was that time the landlord stopped by to let me know the water would be off the next day . Getting up I slowly walked to the door and looked through the peephole . There was just darkness all around . The knocks started again , I quickly pulled the door open . Scott stood there pulling his hand back for some more knocking . `` Scott ? I thought you were.. '' `` Yeah I figured I would visit , you always never knew what to do with yourself '' -- -- -- -- “ She cheated on you with me. ” Scott stared at me silently for a minute before he spoke , “ With you ? I knew she cheated on me but with you ! ” I quickly looked around to make sure we were alone in the park . Suddenly this seemed like a bad idea . `` Yes Scott with me . I was meaning to tell you but when I went to you had… ” “ I had what ? gone to the store ? Why didn ’ t you tell me ? I mean my best friend could have at least had the balls to tell me he was sleeping with my girlfriend. ” “ I couldn ’ t Scott , tell you I mean , you know why the day I went to your house around noon. ” “ So , was I sleeping in ? ” His voice was getting louder and more emotional . I knew I should have kept silent . “ Scott it was June 22nd . The day I found your body on the floor. ” “ I know what the fuck happened June 22nd . I was there you fucking idiot . It was the day after I got fired and life just caught up to me. ” “ After I found you and called 911 I let Becky know . I went to the hospital with you . Becky thought I had told you first and we were the reason for your accident. ” I could see tears welling up in his eyes . We both sat down at the park bench nearby . Scott was silent so I continued . “ It was after they said you did not make it that I called Becky a 2nd time . I had did not realize what it would do to her also . After she didn ’ t answer I called her parents , they… . They found her unconscious in the bathtub. ” “ Beck ’ s is gone , why didn ’ t you tell me ? Here I thought you had just fallen out.. ” “ SCOTT ! You are not listening . Your suicide drove Becky to it also . She couldn ’ t live with herself thinking my night with her was the cause of your death . She didn ’ t realize you had been struggling long before that. ” “ Oh god , no , how could she ? ” His hands came up and covered his face . “ You both left me and I have been struggling these past 5 years trying to live with myself . Everyone blames me for losing you two . Everyone looks at me and wonders at how I could not save either of you . Five years of trying to find a solution and I finally found it. ” “ What do you mean Chris ? You found solution ? Can you change the past ? ” Scott looked eagerly at me . “ I can not change the past Scott. ” I pulled the gun out of my backpack , “ but I can join my friends . ”
The void and the room were one . Far from the world , the world that was the center of the universe , the point that the rest of creation rotated around , was the room , cloaked in darkness . It had been this way for centuries . A quiet , cold tomb . Without warning , a burst of light appeared within the room , casting its features into sharp relief . The void recoiled from the light , before it gathered itself and rushed forwards , intent on reclaiming the room for the darkness . For a moment , the light appeared overwhelmed , before four more lights burst into being , obliterating the darkness and filling the room with a rainbow of colors . `` We are all here , it seems , '' the golden light began . ~~~ The King sat upon his throne , gazing out over his Kingdom , the body of the former ruler cooling at his feet , his new and loyal subjects kneeling before him . He reached out his consciousness and focused , his mind seeping into the waking world before him . He became the heartbeats of the courtiers who supplicated before him . He became the wind gusting through the trees outside . He even became the two who had defied him and yet lived . But more than all of them , more than he was even himself , he was the Earth , and the abominations locked within it . He smiled a slow , feral smile , making a list of priorities . First , he would force the rest of the world to kneel before him . Then , he would find those who dared oppose him . Then , with the might of the world behind him , he would do what not even the gods could do , and face the darkness hidden within the world . He settled back and smiled at all he sensed , for it was good . ( Had to use three to get the dialogue in , sorry ! )
The clap of thunder over head made my heart race but I did n't quicken my pace . `` We better get inside . '' I call over the rumble . `` What ? Are you scared of a little thunder ? '' David laughted but didnt move any faster . It was raining again , as it normally does in Seattle . But rain does n't bother me much anymore . In fact , that 's how I met my best friend , David . The translucent blue , glow of the rift seems to call to me . I turned back once to look at David . He was clutching his chest , trying in vain , to stop himself from bleeding out . I drop the knife on the rain soaked pavement . I refused to let myself think about David , my once best friend , dying feet from me . No more lies , no more secrets , nothing would keep me from the truth this time . I did n't know where ; or for that matter when , the rift led but I had no choice . I knew what I had to do now . What only I could do . Behind me I hear David 's dying moan as I step boldly into the rift . Determined to tack down the one person the one person the people of the world would soon fear most ... Myself .
Tim thought to himself that he 'd never find another friend like Matty . The two had been close since grade school and here he was bailing him out of trouble - again . Tim was always the quieter of the two but was always managing to get himself in sticky situations . Once he tried to play a prank on his babysitter by leaving a little note that said `` HELP ! '' in her makeup bag and he was nearly taken away from his folks . `` Whatever . '' he thought . `` Some people just have no sense of humor . '' **** Tim 's friend watched as the remains of his friend , now reduced to ashes , went into the small hole in the ground . He knew in his heart that he 'd done the right thing - the only thing - but his heart was heavy , nonetheless . He could feel Norma 's eyes on him and he wondered if she had any idea what they 'd been through together , what kind of person Matty really was . Norma wrapped her arms tightly around Tim 's neck and whispered `` Do n't worry , Timmy . I know everything . '' Tim 's body tightened in her embrace as he watched the white cross get buried in the ground .
`` Wow '' He said . He stared up at the opalescent tower . It fractured colors so chaotically it 's almost as if it embodied a massacre of rainbows . And it was beautiful . When he set out to find travel he 'd never realize that his nomadic ways would have him find his way here . He stood there for a moment . Laying down his large backpack . What was in there ? Who was in there ? He asked . He held up his locket he carried with him around his neck . Inside it a picture of his father and him as a young boy . It had a simple note : Find the place where the colors die , Haszcvolt . Love , Dad . He pondered a moment . Simply remembering the days when his father would give him stories of a place which contained all the world . A gate . To everything , and everywhere . Haszcvolt took a deep breath . He strengthened his resolve . He closed his locket , the same opalescence as the tower , and took it off . In the middle of the tower 's fractal doors laid a keyhole fit for one thing . With a second 's thought , Haszcvolt put the locket into it , and pushed open the iridescent doors . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - He 'd done it all . He 'd become every king and every ruler and every emperor . He 'd slain every demon and every angel . He 'd played all gambits and all the perils . And he 'd won it all . Through the door to everything was everything . Haszcvolt was no longer himself . In the quest to live a million lives , he forsake the one given to him . What was his name ? What was he doing here ? The last thing he 'd remember was opening a door that led to literally everything . Everywhere . Every time . Every one . And what did he do ? He did n't know . He laid there on the ground in the grass . The sky was simple to his eyes , it was beautiful . Funny out of all the lives he 'd lived , this one , was his favorite . He heard a sound . He slowly crept up and looked at the tower doors from where he laid . And he saw a familiar boy about to open the door to existence itself .
Death blessed the boy when he was born , even as it took his mother . He had no fear if danger , as he knew the mark upon him meant he was safe . Far more brave than those around him , he climbed , ran , jumped and danced his way through situations that should have killed him . This flamboyance led him into places few had stepped before . All the while , Death watched the boy . ... A peace descended onto him as he see the face of his old friend for the final time . `` No need to show me the way , I 've watched you too many times for that to be a mystery . '' They both chuckled , a dry sound like dice in a cup . `` I kinda failed , did n't I . '' The man remarked , staring into bony sockets . `` At that goal , yes , but you still have your mind in the wrong place . '' Together , they walked forward , shaking the ash from their feet , and moving on .
I should 've been angry . Or scared . Or bitter . But I was n't feeling it . I was n't feeling much of anything really . It was a bit annoying , to be perfectly honest . I did n't like having so much room to think . At least when you 're angry you can focus on whatever pissed you off instead of wondering what you can do to fix it . But when you 're numb all you can do is stare out the tiny window at the vast wilderness and think . And that sucks when it was thinking that screwed you over in the first place . ... The scenery had n't changed . It was still the same monochromatic grey as it had twenty seconds ago , yet it was different . The subtle shades of green and blue decided to slowly creep out of hiding . I was suddenly aware of the immense exhaustion that had been hanging on my shoulders and I finally broke . Nothing that had happened mattered anymore . None of the pain , none of the fear . The past slid away through the tears on my cheeks . For a brief second I was grateful there were so few passengers on the plane , but the thought was quickly pushed away when I felt a hand on my shoulder . Ordinarily I would 've shied away , but for the first time in years I felt free enough to accept it .
Jimmy sat on the roof of the highest tower , legs dangling off the edge as he gazed upon miles and miles of shifting towers made of organic metals as the rising sun shone reflective patterns off the ever moving walls . His golden locks danced as the wind made waves in his jacket . In the streams of flying cars zoomed like ants in one direction , towards the rising sun . Jimmy , a pale young man followed the lines with his eyes . The further down the line he got , the darker it became . It was just the night he thought as the cars flew faster and faster . It will be light even at the edges soon enough , he told himself . Then he saw it , a brilliant flash of red lightning . Then another and another . His mouth agape as he watched the end of the stream at the edge of the black horizon . Red lightning chasing the stream of zooming cars , hoping from one to the next before its parent darkness swallowed the cars whole . Jimmy walked down the pristine halls , no rust , no vomit or blood . Everything so clean , he could almost hear his mother yelling at him for having his shoes on . As he reached for the handle his door , silently , smoothly it opened . Jimmy paused for a moment , he almost missed the rusted squeal of the hinges . He did not miss the omnipresent darkness that welcomed him inside . He looked to the plaque on the door and ran his fingers along his name engraved upon it . COMMANDER J. MCREARY . Slowly he crept into the room , unsure of where he could sit or what he could move . There was a desk and sheet upon a fresh mattress , with a freshly pressed uniform laying upon it . He had more than a speaker with a receiver attached sitting on his desk . He 'd need a deck hand to show him how too use it , but that would come later . He grabbed the uniform and took it too the washroom . The new uniform had such vivid colours and a distinct lack of tears . In the mirrors reflection all he could see , was his decade old uniform , scarcely washed , covered in holes and colours so faded they no longer carried any semblance of his status . He looked himself in the eyes . The eyes no a faded blue , the lips cracked and scared , the scraggly beard , no of it shocked him , but his hair . His once golden locks were gone , replaced by a dirt grey and cut away til they could barely be seen . He sigh as he closed his eyes .
This is the Truth . Or at least the Whole of it that I could find . I stood at a crossroads . One third of my Life had passed . I had seen highs and lows and feasted on as much as my senses could find . I had travelled . I had loved , I had lived . I had learned as the schools saw fit , and I had been employed at jobs filled with promise , that faded to naught . The more I thought I knew , the better I made my plans , the more they crumbled and I was left feeling alone , and lost . Insecure . -- - Reduced to flesh , this creature , once proud and immortal , felt the crumbling of his bone minute by minute , felt the raggedness of breathe first drawn through lungs newly formed , the shiver of cold through skin grown paper frail . The chill of the chiyl scoured floor did not bother him though , it was the intricate fissures and cracks smashed into it though that did , for it reflected the chaotic state of his own mind , which now felt small and shattered . He looked up , and saw a single ray of light pierce the hole in the ceiling , and wondered to himself , `` where do I begin ... ''
It 's another foggy day out in the open waters . We 've been floating in the pacific for three weeks without seeing any land for us to rebuild our main mast . It was damaged in our last battle and we 've just been free floating . We lost 32 people out of our 67 person crew and I 'm not sure how much longer we 'll be able to float before we run out of food and water I 'm fatigued to fatigued to leave the raft even though I have reached mainland . After laying there after what seemed days I get out of my raft and crawl to the small farmhouse that I landed near . As I knock on the door I hear their voices it now dawns on me that I never left and I will be trapped here forever until they kill me .
`` Mark called from the hospital . He says there 's something wrong with the patients . They 're attacking the doctors . Biting people . He sounded scared . '' Megan looked at me with worry in her eyes , silently begging me to make it all better . In truth , I did n't know what was going on either , but I pulled her close and smiled a little . `` It 's gon na be fine , you 'll see . The cops are already on their way . '' I 'd always enjoyed cleaning my gun . There was something ironically peaceful about it . Cathartic . Not this time though . She was rattling the door . I avoided looking at her , I could n't . Four years of this shit . I did n't remember what a hot shower felt like . I did n't remember the feeling of warm food . I had n't had a soda in years . It was OK though , cause at least I had Meg . I finally forced myself to look at her . She snarled at me , bits of dead flesh beginning to hang off her face . I raised my gun . Just two bullets left . Just enough .
I walk to work , as i do every day . A single leaf falls , as i pass the tree on the corner of my street . Lauren enters the coffee shop on the other side of the street , as she does every day . I walk up the stairs to the office building and greet the gatekeeper , take the elevator to the 32rd floor and begin my 8 hour shift . This is going to be another shitty day at my shitty job , just like every day . [ ... ] I walk to work , as i do every day .

`` So whattya think ? '' `` Well , I used to be really afraid of death ... not so much anymore . '' `` Yeah ? What happened ? '' Kevin stared off into the universe , took 3 seconds to ponder the meaning of life , and looked back toward James . `` I dunno . I think somewhere along the line I just realized that as long as I was doing something great , something that 's going to be remembered , then if I could go out like that I would n't mind . '' `` But what if you did n't ? '' `` Did n't die ? '' `` No . What if no one remembers you ? '' `` I 'm okay with that too . Then as long as I was doing something important to me , I 'd be satisfied . '' `` Hmm . '' James nodded in recognition of his friend 's stance . `` What about you ? '' `` Me ? '' `` Yeah ... how do *you* feel about death ? '' `` Does n't matter really . '' `` How so ? '' `` Does n't apply . '' `` What , you 're not gon na die ? '' `` Maybe , maybe not . '' `` What the hell do you mean *maybe* ? It 's a for sure thing . People dying is a fact ; I 'm sure there are millions of quotes about it . You know ? Like whoever said 'Nothing is promised in life except death ' ? '' `` I have no evidence that says I will . '' `` Come on , you ca n't jus- '' `` **Look** , if you go around thinking about death , you never get the chance to live . It 's not ignorance , it 's just going off of my past experiences which do n't indicate anything . '' `` But you were born . Statistically 100 % of people who were born - die . '' `` All I 'm saying is as far as I 'm concerned , I wo n't know I 'm dead until it already happens . So that 's how I 'm going to live my life . '' ******** Kevin sat in the foyer of James ' parents home for the first time in a long time . He softly tossed the condolence gift back and forth between his hands resting on his lap . It was more of a formality , this whole process . Visiting his parents , saying that he was there for them , empathy , and so on until the day was over . Kevin was more surprised than anything . James always did what James wanted to do . So his backpacking through Asia was something that everyone encouraged ; everyone expected him to be able to take care of himself . And in that same vein , no one blames anyone for encouraging him to head to China for a quick trip before coming back to the States . No one could have predicted what could have happened . No one . The flight from Malaysia was supposed to be there within hours , a routine flight . Kevin certainly did n't blame himself . After all , James really knew what he was doing . James did what he said . James did n't die . He disappeared , which without factual evidence or a body , James ' whereabouts would be forever unknown , his status a permanent state of limbo . Kevin never felt sad talking about knowing James . James would now be remembered and as far as Kevin was concerned , was n't dead . After today , Kevin resolved to never talk about James ' disappearance again . If he went around talking about what might have happened , he would never get the chance to live his own life . As far as Kevin was concerned , James would never be dead until James found out for sure . That 's how he resolved to live his life . Edit : fucked up the formatting , will fix later .
He was awake and smiling a full two hours before his alarm was set signal the glorious day . It was Conor 's last day before his overdue , extended vacation . He would finally leave the void which had consumed most of time allotted to his life . Sure he had , much as anyone , made trips out of town and state , but tonight would begin the journey of leaving country and continent . ... Some days Conor would blame himself . Others he felt there was nothing he could have done . But most he felt nothing . He did not die in the slaughter . He had not survived . He suffered a slow , persistent death .
The colors of the crowd blurred together like lights on a Christmas tree . Each and every one of us had spent years of our lived together . We were ecstatic for the next chapter ; the one we spent strenuous effort and ruthless time striving for . Rows and rows of us were gathered in front of our loved ones . My mind drifted to the sounds of the birds chirping and the indistinct chatter beyond our special moment . This would be remembered forever . It was almost time to be handed the certificate , which defined the rest of my life . My heart raced , while my mind searched for any other stimulus to distract me from how nervous I was . This would affect my life forever , but now I have to go . ________________________________________________________________ *I ca n't handle this anymore ! * The words rang through my head . I held my head into my knees , which muffled the sound of sobbing from the neighbors who lived above and below me . This was too much . Panic has been settled in my chest for too long . There 's just not enough ! Life is tearing me apart . The world faded out and my surroundings became quiet . I lied down . The bathroom floor was cold on my back . I stared at the ceiling as tears streamed down my face . An empty bottle of pills rested in my hands . My voice sounded raspy as I whispered , `` This will affect my life forever , but now I have to go . ''
She did n't wake me at her normal time . I 'd gotten so used to the smile in her voice dancing on my dreams over the years singing `` eight oh nine , baby boy '' everyday , that my heart started and I slammed my hand down with more force than intended on the 'off ' button as my alarm clock blared to life bringing me the morning 's weather and news with Rick Rensin and Rachel ... A storm was coming from the looks of the blue light filtering through the curtains . Why did n't she wake me ? ... A few cycles back I heard what sounded like a child calling for help just on the edge of the woods . Hearing another human voice after these many months alone had me hoping she 'd found me as she said she 'd found the others . It being a child made resisting harder . In a way , it was a good thing that the wound opened again . I had to listen to it longer , and that voice held that same quality as the others ... alien ... foreign . So I keep watch , as the moon continues to cover the sun 's light , waiting for her . The radio silently waiting to be held once more .
I picked up the gun , knowing it was going to be one of those days . I holstered it and grabbed my jacket . Six months I had waited . Six months I had watched . Well , the wait was over . I stepped out the door . I stepped through the door . My jacket lay in taters , but I hung it anyways . With my good arm I drew my battered gun and lay it on the table . I sat down at the table . Six months was a long time to wait . But it was worth it . I closed my eyes . I laid my head down . I died .
On this day , he felt nothing but melancholy . Everybody only talked of his wrongs , how he was ruining the kingdom he built , how ineffective his administration was , and how the west will conquer the world . Arthur could not give anything more than he already gave out , and it made him sad . Elsewhere , a man tried his best not to be noticed . Being noticed could kill him . Not that he cared , at this point . Actually , yes , he did care . If he was dead , he could not take back what was rightfully his . His wife and kid may die , his land destroyed , and all his friends , if you can call them that , may die . `` Ill live , I promise it . Someday ... someday i will come back . '' whispered Arthur before he fell asleep .
I remember that it hurt . It was dark and the temperature was dropping when I felt the knife slip into my lower back . Driving in ward , going for the liver , the blade just to the left of my spine . I did n't hear him coming and I did n't hear him leave . I guess it could have been a woman , but she would have to have bigger muscles than me to drive a blade that deep . Anyway , it was the mark of a pro . With a wound like that it would take me a long time to die . Someone was trying to make a statement and why not ? I 'd pissed off a lot of people in a very short amount of time . ___ I sat there for a long time after Frankie walked out . She was smart and she was tough . I had hopes for her . A long while later I stood up , stretched and walked out of my office , closing the paneled door on my way out . It was time for dinner .

Prologue . The sun was setting on the horizon , casting a golden hue over the small town of Maple Grove . It was a peaceful evening , the kind of evening that made you forget all your troubles and just enjoy the moment . But for one young woman , this evening was anything but peaceful . Her name was Sarah , and she had been living in Maple Grove for the past few months . She had come here to escape her past , to start a new life and to find a place where she could finally be happy . But now , as she stood on the edge of town , she felt a chill run down her spine . Something was wrong . She could feel it in her bones . She looked around , trying to find the source of her unease , but all she saw were the same old buildings and streets she had grown used to . Nothing seemed out of the ordinary . But then , out of the corner of her eye , she saw something move . It was a figure , shrouded in darkness , standing in the shadows of an alleyway . Sarah 's heart began to race as she realized that the figure was watching her . She wanted to run , but her feet were rooted to the spot . She was too scared to move . The figure stepped out of the shadows and into the light . It was a man , tall and thin , with a pale face and dark eyes . He was wearing a long black coat and a wide-brimmed hat . The man smiled at Sarah , and she felt a chill run down her spine . She knew , without a doubt , that this man was trouble . But before she could turn and run , the man spoke . `` Hello , Sarah , '' he said in a low , raspy voice . `` My name is Mr. Smith . I 've been looking for you . ''
I won the championship last year by traveling back to April 30 , 1945 and killing Hitler in a very creative and difficult way . I had to make sure that my actions did n't disrupt the timeline , so I had to be very careful . First , I traveled back to April 20 , 1945 and posed as a German soldier . I then infiltrated Hitler 's bunker and planted a bomb in the ventilation system . I set the timer for 10 days , so that it would go off on April 30 . On April 30 , I traveled back to the bunker and waited for the bomb to go off . When it did , I used the chaos to my advantage and snuck up behind Hitler and shot him in the head . The judges were impressed with my creativity and difficulty , and awarded me the championship .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 30 , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods : I first used a time machine to travel back to the day of Hitler 's suicide and then I used a powerful laser to shoot him in the head . The time machine allowed me to arrive at the exact moment that Hitler was about to commit suicide , and the laser allowed me to shoot him in the head without anyone noticing . This was a difficult task , as I had to make sure that I was in the right place at the right time and that I had the right equipment . I was able to pull it off , however , and I was awarded the championship for my creativity and difficulty . It was a great feeling to know that I had accomplished something that no one else had ever done before .

The city was bustling with activity as usual , but today was different . Today , the people of the city were abuzz with excitement . Today was the day of the annual ranking ceremony , where the citizens of the city were ranked according to their powers . The rankings were based on a variety of factors , including the strength and control of their powers , as well as their ability to use them in creative ways . Everyone was eager to find out where they stood in the rankings , and who would be the city 's most powerful citizen .

I won the championship by taking a creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . I traveled back in time to the early 1930s when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power .

I also sabotaged his speeches and rallies , making sure that his message never reached its intended audience . At the same time , I worked to build up the opposition to Hitler . I used my knowledge of the future to help the anti-Hitler forces gain an edge . I provided them with resources and information that allowed them to outmaneuver and outwit Hitler . In the end , my efforts paid off . Hitler 's plans were thwarted and he was never able to gain the power he sought . I had successfully killed Hitler without ever having to lay a finger on him . It was a victory that earned me the championship and the admiration of my fellow time travelers .

I won the championship last year by taking a unique and creative approach to killing Hitler . Instead of simply going back in time and shooting him , I decided to use a more subtle approach . First , I traveled back to the early 1930s and infiltrated Hitler 's inner circle . I then slowly began to manipulate him and his followers , subtly influencing their decisions and actions . I slowly and subtly shifted their beliefs and attitudes towards Jews and other minorities , making them more accepting and tolerant . At the same time , I worked to undermine Hitler 's power base , slowly eroding his support and influence . I used my influence to encourage people to speak out against him and his policies , and I even managed to get some of his closest allies to turn against him . Finally , I used my influence to convince Hitler to commit suicide , thus ending his reign of terror and saving millions of lives . It was a difficult and risky mission , but in the end it was worth it . I 'm proud to have been the champion last year , and I hope to continue to be a champion for years to come .
I won last year 's championship by going back in time to the early days of World War II . I had to be careful to make sure I did n't change the course of history , so I decided to use a very creative and difficult approach . First , I infiltrated Hitler 's inner circle and gained his trust . I then slowly began to poison him with small doses of arsenic , making sure to keep the doses low enough that it would take a long time for the poison to take effect . Once I was sure that Hitler was slowly being poisoned , I waited for the right moment to strike . I waited until Hitler was in a weakened state and then I attacked him with a sword . I was able to take him by surprise and quickly end his life . My creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler earned me the championship title . It was a risky move , but it paid off in the end .

I won the championship last year by using a combination of creativity and difficulty . I started by traveling back in time to the early 1940s and infiltrating Hitler 's inner circle . I made sure to gain his trust and then I began to subtly sabotage his plans . I worked to weaken his forces and undermine his authority . Next , I set up a series of traps and diversions to distract and confuse Hitler and his followers . I used a variety of tactics , from fake documents to false rumors , to keep them off balance . Finally , I set up a plan to assassinate Hitler . I used a combination of explosives , poison , and a sniper rifle to ensure that he would not survive . I made sure to time it perfectly so that it would be impossible for him to escape . My plan worked and I was able to successfully kill Hitler . I was awarded the championship for my creativity and difficulty in executing the plan .

I won last year 's championship by killing Hitler using an unconventional approach . I traveled back in time to the year 1945 , when Hitler was in his bunker . I had a plan to use a combination of psychological manipulation and physical force to convince him to take his own life . First , I found a way to get close to Hitler and gain his trust . I posed as a loyal Nazi and convinced him that I had an important message from the Fuhrer himself . I then used this trust to slowly convince him that Germany was doomed and that his death would be the only way to save the German people from further suffering . Once I had him convinced , I used physical force to make sure he followed through with his plan . I held a gun to his head and threatened to shoot him if he did n't take his own life . He eventually complied and I was able to take him out without any casualties . My creative approach and successful execution earned me the championship title . It was a risky mission but the reward was worth it .

Last year , I won the time-traveler 's competition for killing Hitler by taking a rather unconventional approach . Instead of going back in time and killing him directly , I decided to take a more subtle approach . First , I traveled back to the early 1930s and infiltrated the Nazi party . Once I was in , I began to work my way up the ranks , slowly gaining the trust of Hitler and his inner circle . As I gained more power , I began to subtly influence the decisions Hitler was making , slowly steering him away from his more extreme policies . I also worked to undermine his power and influence , slowly chipping away at his base of support . I spread rumors , planted evidence , and used my position to discredit his allies . I even managed to get a few of his closest advisors arrested on trumped-up charges . By the time I was done , Hitler was a shell of his former self . His influence was waning , and his grip on power was slipping . Eventually , he was forced to step down , and the Nazi party was dissolved . I won the competition because I was able to effectively neutralize Hitler without causing any major disruptions to the timeline . My approach was creative , subtle , and effective , and it earned me the title of last year 's champion .

One day , the King of the Golden Forest had to leave the village . He told the villagers that he had to go on a long journey , and that he would be back one day .

Last year , I won the time traveler 's competition for killing Hitler by taking a creative and difficult approach . Instead of simply assassinating him , I decided to go back to the moment when Hitler was born . I arrived in the small town of Braunau am Inn in Austria on April 20th , 1889 , and I waited . When the time came , I posed as a midwife and delivered Hitler 's mother 's baby . After the baby was born , I snuck out of the room and quickly grabbed a nearby pillow . I then proceeded to smother the newborn Hitler with the pillow , thus preventing him from ever coming into power . My creative approach to killing Hitler earned me the highest score of the competition and the title of champion . It was a daring and dangerous mission , but I knew it was the only way to ensure that the atrocities of the Holocaust would never take place .
I won last year 's championship by taking a very creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . Instead of trying to physically assassinate him , I decided to travel back in time and subtly manipulate his life so that he would never rise to power . I started by traveling back to when Hitler was a young adult and living in Vienna . I befriended him and started to subtly influence his decisions . I encouraged him to pursue his artistic aspirations instead of joining the military . I also persuaded him to move to Munich so that he would be away from the political turmoil in Vienna . After that , I traveled back to the beginning of World War I and convinced Hitler to enlist in the Austrian army instead of the German army . By doing this , I ensured that he would be away from the front lines and would not be able to gain any political power . Finally , I traveled back to the early 1920s and convinced Hitler to join the Nazi party . I made sure to discourage him from taking any leadership positions in the party and instead encouraged him to focus on his artwork . By the time I was finished , Hitler was nothing more than a struggling artist with no political ambitions . I had successfully killed Hitler without ever firing a single shot .

I won last year 's championship by traveling back to the year 1939 , when Hitler was preparing to launch World War II . I crafted a plan that was both creative and difficult . First , I sought out the man who was responsible for delivering the orders for Hitler 's troops to mobilize . I then infiltrated his office and , using my knowledge of the future , wrote a false order that would lead Hitler 's troops in the opposite direction of their intended destination . Next , I went directly to Hitler 's residence and , using a combination of my wits and charm , I convinced him to stay at home instead of leading the troops . With Hitler out of the way , I was able to ensure that the false orders were followed and the war never began . My plan was a success and I was crowned the champion of the Time Travelers Killing Hitler competition . It was an unforgettable experience and one that I will never forget .

The air was still and quiet , the only sound being the occasional chirp of a cricket . It was the perfect night for a walk .

Prologue . The sun had just set , casting an orange glow across the village . The cobblestone streets were filled with the hustle and bustle of the locals , all heading home before the darkness of night took over . The air was filled with the smell of freshly baked bread and the sounds of distant laughter . Just outside the village walls , a lone figure stood waiting .

Last year , I decided to take a different approach to killing Hitler and win the time traveler 's sport . Instead of going back in time and trying to gun him down or poison him , I opted to use a more subtle approach . I traveled back to the 1920s , when Hitler was a struggling artist in Vienna . I managed to gain access to his inner circle and proceeded to slowly undermine his self-esteem and confidence . I planted the seeds of doubt and self-loathing in his mind , which eventually led to his mental breakdown . Hitler 's confidence was destroyed and he eventually withdrew from public life . He was unable to continue his political ambitions and eventually died in obscurity . This strategy won me the title of Time Traveler 's Champion , as nobody else thought to use such a subtle approach to killing Hitler . I 'm proud to be the champion , and hope that my story will inspire other time travelers to think outside the box and come up with more creative ways of killing Hitler .

I had the ability to influence the minds of those around me . I could make them see what I wanted them to see , hear what I wanted them to hear , and believe what I wanted them to believe . It was a powerful ability and one I had to use carefully . To keep my power a secret , I had to be constantly vigilant . Someone of a higher rank could easily challenge me and try to take my rank . I knew that if I were to be found out , there would be no mercy . My paranoia was well founded , as I soon discovered that there were others who wanted my rank . A group of challengers had banded together in the hopes of finding out my secret and using it against me . I had to be careful and crafty . I used my power of deception to create a false sense of security and lead them astray . I was able to outwit them and keep my rank , but it was a close call . In the end , I was able to keep my secret and remain rank # 1 . I still keep my power hidden , but I know that the challengers are out there , waiting for the right moment to take me down . I have to remain vigilant , for I know that if I let my guard down , I could lose my rank in an instant .
The sun was setting in the horizon , its fading light giving way to darkness . Pinks and oranges gave the sky an ethereal beauty , a peaceful lullaby for the world below . Shadows crept across the land , the birds in flight migrating to safety . All were aware of the impending night , and the chill it brought with it . The stars began to shine , like tiny diamonds in the night sky . Serenity settled on the lands below , a moment of peace in a chaotic world . In the stillness , a single thought came to mind : Home .
It 's hard to say goodbye to a friend , but it 's important to remember that all things must come to an end . As your friend grows up and their needs and imaginations change , it 's only natural that you must fade away . Although you may no longer be a part of their life , the memories and adventures you shared will always remain in their hearts . They may not need you anymore , but your impact on their lives will never be forgotten . Take comfort in the knowledge that they are still the same person you once knew and that your friendship , though fleeting , was special and meaningful . As you leave , remember to be proud of the impact you made in your friend 's life and the special place you had in their hearts .
The city was bustling with activity as people of all ages and backgrounds moved about the streets . But there was something different about this city - something strange , something that made it stand out amongst all the other cities . This city was full of people with extraordinary powers . It was an unspoken rule that each person was ranked according to their power . Those with the strongest powers were at the top of the hierarchy , while those with weaker powers were at the bottom . I was at the very top of this hierarchy , ranked number one . But nobody knew what my power was . I had kept it a closely guarded secret , not wanting to reveal it to anyone . I had seen the consequences of those who revealed their powers too quickly , and I had no intention of making the same mistake . I had managed to maintain my rank for years , but I was aware that it was only a matter of time before someone else tried to challenge me . The city was full of ambitious people , and they were all hungry for power . I had heard rumors of those who had killed their rivals in order to take their rank . It was a gruesome tactic , but it was effective . I knew that if someone were to discover my power , they would use any means necessary to take my rank . But I was also aware that I could use my power to protect myself . I had been training hard , honing my skills and learning how to control my power . I had to be ready in case someone ever decided to challenge me . I had already seen the consequences of too much power in the wrong hands . I had no intention of letting the same thing happen to me . I was determined to protect my rank and my power at all costs . For now , I had to be content with the fact that nobody knew what my power was . But I was prepared to fight for it if I ever had to . I was the number one ranked in the city , and I was determined to stay that way .

Every day I would come back to it , curious to see what new emotions had been donated . I felt a range of emotions , from love to anger , and each emotion taught me something new about myself . I learned how to interact with others in a more meaningful way , how to express my emotions in a healthy way , and how to appreciate the small things in life . The donation box had given me a new lease on life . I was no longer a person without emotion , but a person with a wide range of emotions that could be used to enrich my life .

The donation of happiness allowed me to appreciate the small moments in life , the moments that I had previously taken for granted .

I was able to find joy in life , something I had not experienced before . I was able to appreciate life , something I had not done in a long time . The donation of happiness has changed my life , and I am forever grateful for it .
The sun was setting on the horizon , casting its final rays of the day . A cool breeze blew through the air , rustling the leaves of the trees . The sky was turning a brilliant shade of pink . The birds were singing their evening songs , in harmony with the crickets . The sweet scent of flowers filled the air as a deer emerged from the forest . It stopped and looked around , before turning and walking away . The world was peaceful , the sound of nature calming the soul . The sun disappeared , leaving a blanket of stars in its wake . The night sky lit up , its beauty captivating those who gazed upon it . The peaceful silence was broken by a single word : `` Home . ''

She closed her eyes and whispered a silent prayer , thanking the heavens for this moment . Peace .

Last year , I traveled back in time to Nazi Germany with a single mission in mind : to kill Adolf Hitler . In order to maximize my score and make the mission as difficult as possible , I had come up with a plan that I thought was pretty creative . I traveled to the year 1938 and made my way to the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich , Germany , where Hitler was scheduled to give a speech that evening . Knowing that he would be surrounded by bodyguards , I decided I had to come up with a way to get rid of them without raising too much suspicion . My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to 1938 earlier in the day . Then , I used some of my modern day technology to create a diversion . I hacked into the PA system at the Bürgerbräukeller and broadcast a message that a bomb was set to go off in the building . The message caused mass panic and everyone evacuated , including Hitler ’ s bodyguards . With the bodyguards out of the way , I was able to sneak in unnoticed and find Hitler . I quickly pulled out my handgun and shot him twice , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was awarded the highest score of the year . I was the undisputed champion of time traveling Hitler-killers .

Last year , I was crowned champion of the Killing Hitler competition , and let me tell you it was n't easy ! My strategy was to travel back to 1939 , right before the outbreak of World War II , and use my knowledge of the future to shape current events . First , I made sure that Hitler was placed in a position of power , so that I could get to him . Then I spread rumors of a coup attempt . This caused Hitler to take on extra security measures , including hiring a personal bodyguard . Knowing that Hitler 's bodyguard was notoriously loyal , I bribed him to secretly assassinate Hitler . On the day of the assassination , the bodyguard took out a gun and shot Hitler in the head . My plan worked , and I was awarded the Champion title for my creativity and risk-taking . Killing Hitler may be a sport , but it certainly is n't an easy one !
The sun had just started to rise and the birds were singing their morning tune when John made his way to the old abandoned shack . He had heard stories of what people had seen in there , and he was determined to find out the truth . John opened the door and stepped inside , feeling a chill run down his spine as he did so . The shack was dark and dusty , but he could see something was off . He could sense that something was in the air , something he could n't quite explain . John started to explore , cautiously making his way around the room , trying to make sense of what he was seeing . He had no idea what he was getting himself into , but he was determined to find out .
Last year I won the championship by taking a rather creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . I decided to go back in time to 1936 , right before Hitler had been appointed Chancellor of Germany . I began by posing as a delivery man and gained access to Hitler 's office . Once inside , I quickly grabbed a heavy fountain pen from his desk and thrust it into his neck . The pen went through his jugular vein , killing him almost immediately . My plan was to make it appear as though Hitler had died from natural causes , so I took the time to clean up the scene , removing any evidence of my involvement . After I was sure everything was in order , I quietly slipped out of the building and returned to my own time . My plan was a success , and I was crowned champion for my creativity and difficulty in killing Hitler .
I am the most powerful person in the city , yet no one else knows what my power is . It 's a secret I am sworn to keep , and I have gone to great lengths to protect my anonymity . Every day , I walk among the people of the city , hoping to remain invisible . I watch as the powerful show off their impressive powers , from telekinetic feats to electro kinesis displays . I feel a twinge of envy , wishing that I could show off my own power , whatever it may be . But I also feel a sense of responsibility . I am ranked number one in the city , and it is my duty to protect the people from the dangerous powers of the others . I will not risk revealing my power , for I know that if someone were to discover it , they could use it to kill me and take my rank . So , I remain alone and unseen , walking the streets while watching and listening . I pay attention to any signs of unrest , any hints that someone is using their powers to commit a crime or hurt someone . If I see something suspicious , I act quickly , using my own mysterious power to stop the troublemaker . No matter what happens , I will continue to live in my city and protect the innocent people within it . They may not know what my power is , but I hope they can trust that I will always be there , keeping them safe .

Last year , I managed to win the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition with a daring and creative plan . A few days before the infamous Fuhrer 's assassination attempt in the bunker , I traveled back in time to intercept and replace his chef , who was responsible for preparing his meals . I had carefully researched the ingredients and meals Hitler favored and created a delicious-looking dish of potatoes and gravy glazed with honey , that was actually laced with a potent poison . On the day of the attempt , Hitler unsuspectingly ate the poisoned meal , within minutes he was dead . I quickly escaped from the bunker , undetected , and made my way back to present day . The judges of the competition were extremely impressed with my plan , praising its ingenuity and execution . I 'm proud to say that I am the current Killing Hitler champion !

The sun was bright and the sky was clear when I stepped outside to start my day . I had put this day off for far too long , but I had finally made up my mind to do it . I arrived at my destination , feeling a mix of nervousness and determination . I had told myself over and over I would make it to this point , and here I was . I was ready to get started .

She only said she loved him , but he knew it was n't enough . Ever since his breaking heart had been shattered in two , he was determined to never let another woman close enough to cause him that kind of pain again . And so , for many years , he kept her at a distance , never allowing her to penetrate the walls around his heart . Yet something about her made it harder and harder for him to keep his walls up -- he found himself wanting to open up to her , and to share with her the stories of his past . He knew if he let her in , she would see the broken pieces of his heart , and he was scared of how she would react . But one day , he found the courage to tell her . He told her the story of his broken heart , and when he finished , she only said she loved him . It felt like a soothing balm to his weary soul , and it was the first time he felt something other than pain when it came to love . For the first time , he felt hope . He allowed himself to be vulnerable and opened his heart to her , and she only said she loved him .
The snow was a blinding white outside the apartment building , reflecting the morning light in a way that almost hurt the eyes .

He had been dreading this day for weeks , it was the day he was to meet his estranged father . As the bus pulled away , Tommy sighed , not sure if he was ready to face his father after all .

Whatever was waiting for him in his father 's office , he was about to find out .

The city of my residence was populated with people with remarkable powers - telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , and more - that kept it humming with activity . I was the most powerful of them all , yet no one knew what my power was . Upon this hidden power , I was crowned the # 1 rank . From there , the pecking order fell among the other gifted citizens . Moving up in rank was an elusive concept , as no one could advance their status without overturning another who had obtained it before them . It was an eternal cycle of gaining power by murdering another . The thought of killing a fellow citizen to accomplish my goal was appalling . Yet , the higher ranks seemed to have accepted the fact that it was a necessary evil in a city overflowing with powerful people . Some even embraced it as an opportunity to increase their own rank and influence . I continued to largely remain aloof , never bearing my power or attempting to take the higher rank . I had no intention of taking another 's life , especially of those powerful citizens who had obtained their rank through hard work and ambition . However , as the years went on , my power remained a mystery . People whispered and speculated about the nameless person at the top of the leaderboards , but no one could answer what it was that put me there . Eventually , I had to accept the fact that I was never going to reveal my power , or even make any efforts to advance in rank . I just wanted to watch and observe this unique , powerful city and its citizens . I continued to live peacefully in my position at the top , watching from a distance and taking pleasure in the beauty and seeming harmony that surrounded me . I hoped that the citizens of the city would be able to use their powers for greater good instead of for personal gain . I was content simply living anonymously as the mysterious , most powerful citizen in the city .

Despite the difficulties of life , their love only ever grew stronger with time . Until they both left this world , they would never forget the day she said she loved him only .
It had been this way for as long as I can remember . In this city , every person had their own special power , whether it was telekinesis , electrokinesis , or even the ability to 'sense ' things . As a result , these powers became a way to rank people within the city . Everyone had their own rank , and I was number one . No one knew what my power was , not even myself . I had never been able to unlock it . But this fact made me the most feared person of all . It was said that with my power I could bring down the whole city with a single thought . But that wasn ’ t the end of it . Rumors had spread that anyone who could kill me could take my place as number one . People had been trying to find a way to take out the number one spot for years now , searching for any weakness or vulnerability that I might have . But I knew that I could never be taken down . I had worked for years to make sure that my power stayed hidden , and I had become a master of my secrets . If someone wanted to take my spot , they were going to have to work hard to even stand a chance . In the end , no one ever did . To this day , I remain the number one of the city , and no one has been able to take my place . My power still remains a mystery , but I ’ m content with that . As long as no one knows what my power is , they ’ ll never be able to take me down .
The sun was shining , the birds were singing , and it was the perfect day . He had been planning this day for months and now it had finally arrived . Strolling through the park he felt a sense of joy , a feeling of independence . Everywhere he looked people were smiling , and he allowed himself to bask in the warmth of the day . He took a deep breath and let the fragrant flowers fill his senses . Reclining on a bench in the distance he heard the laughter of children and felt the excitement in the air . Closing his eyes he thought of all the wonderful moments life had given him . All the experiences and people he had encountered , the places he had seen and the lessons he had learned . As he stood to leave the park he thanked the world for this beautiful day and all the joy it had brought him . Contentment .
The city was full of people with supernatural powers , every citizen capable of doing things that seemed absolutely impossible . Everyone was ranked based on how powerful they were and I was the strongest of them all , the number one ranked citizen with a power so great that no one , not even I was aware of what it was . Everyone wanted to get their hands on my secrets , and if they wanted the power for themselves , they had to kill me in order to assume my rank . Many tried but none succeeded , thwarted by some unseen force that protected me at all times . This force was so powerful that even I could sense it when I was in danger and it gave me a feeling of invincibility . I was the most powerful citizen in the city , yet I stayed humble , never revealing my powers and never taking advantage of anyone weaker than me . I lived my life in peace , vigilant and aware of any potential threats . Then , one fateful day , I encountered a man of immense power and strength . He was also ranked number 1 and we were evenly matched . I could feel the power radiating off of him and knew that I had to use every ounce of strength I had if I wanted to survive . The fight lasted for hours and I was exhausted , but I eventually emerged victorious . After that , my reputation spread like wildfire and I was known as `` The Invincible '' . People would come up to me and beg me to share my secrets , but I never did . My power was my own and I kept it a secret until the day I died . Even now , no one knows what my power was , but I am still remembered as the strongest citizen in the city .

But when she uttered those words , Roger knew it was all just an act of self-protection . He approached her and held her close , tears in both of their eyes .

Every chance she had , she would find herself in the same room with him , smiling , flirting , trying to get his attention . But no matter how hard she tried , Tom never seemed to reciprocate her feelings . One day , after months of trying , Jill finally mustered up the courage to tell Tom how she felt . She glanced up and down the hallway , butterflies in her stomach , and then she blurted it out : `` I love you . '' Tom 's expression immediately changed to shock . He seemed to be at a loss for words . After a few moments , he simply replied , `` Thank you . '' Jill had no idea what was going through his mind , but she could feel her cheeks flush with embarrassment . She turned and started walking away , her heart heavy with disappointment . That was when Tom spoke again . `` Wait , '' he said . `` I just want you to know that I feel the same way too . '' Jill turned around , hopeful but still uncertain . Tom smiled , then shifted his gaze . `` I ... I love you , too , '' he whispered . With a relieved and grateful smile , Jill finally could believe it was true : she only said she loved him , and he loved her back .
Standing before you is a perfect reflection of yourself . You feel guilty and ashamed , as though all the hurt and pain you caused is now staring right back at you .

I should have treated people better and taken responsibility for my actions . I 'm sorry for all the pain I caused , and I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to make up for it . Please forgive me . '' The reflection smiles and nods , and you feel a wave of relief wash over you . You 've been forgiven . The door to Heaven appears behind the reflection and you take one last look before you take the first step . You are forgiven , and now you can go on to experience the joys of Heaven .

Jasmine had always been the top of her class in school ; she was the smartest , most athletic and the most popular student . She was never one to boast of her academic achievements , or show off her skills , but everyone knew Jasmine was the best at what she did . So it wasn ’ t a surprise when Jasmine was crowned the # 1-ranked citizen of the city ; a city were everyone had some kind of power , from electrokinesis to telekinesis , and even sensors that could detect things around them with alarming accuracy . But what was strange about Jasmine was that no one knew the exact nature of her power . All they knew was that , whatever it was , it was powerful enough to put her at the top , and that it was so powerful , no one had ever been able to challenge her . After all , it wasn ’ t as if you could just kill someone of higher rank and gain their rank . This made Jasmine even more of an enigma . Everyone tried to guess what she could do , to no avail . Some whispered that she was the master of all 8 elements and could control them all ; others theorized that she had a secret weapon that enabled her to defeat any opponent , no matter their power set . But no one really knew . One day , while walking in the park , Jasmine stumbled across a strange device . It looked like a simple box with a few buttons , but when Jasmine pressed one of the buttons , suddenly , she was surrounded by an energy field that seemed to be made out of thin air . Jasmine soon realized that this was her power ; she could create force fields with a sheer thought . Any person or object that came into contact with the force fields was unable to move ; it was like they were stuck in an invisible prison . Jasmine smiled to herself ; no wonder no one had been able to challenge her . She had the ultimate weapon , a power that not even the most powerful in the city could beat . From then on , no one ever thought of contesting Jasmine ’ s rank as the # 1-ranked citizen . She was the most revered in the city , and she had a power that no one else could match .

You 're taken aback , wondering why you have to confront yourself to get into Heaven . You remember you 're supposed to be honest with yourself , so you ponder deeply .

At first , it felt strange to be standing face-to-face with myself . I felt an immediate recognition of all the harm I had done to myself . I realized that a huge part of getting into Heaven was really about coming to terms with the past and facing up to myself for all the pain I had caused . I prepared myself for the task ahead , and though every part of me wanted to run away and hide , I stayed and asked myself the difficult questions . I made sure to give myself the time and space to feel and process my thoughts , and I used the opportunity to forgive and accept myself for the harm I had done . As I spent time listening to myself , I could feel a catharsis washing over me , and I could feel a profound sense of peace and resolution afterward . As I left this moment of self-reflection , I felt a newfound serenity and acceptance within me .

I knew I had something special when I crafted my unique plan to win . I took a time-travelling ship out of the future and went back to April 20th , 1945 , the day that Hitler committed suicide . For this plan , speed and precision were key . I gathered as many resources and allies as I could in the future , including a number of robotic mechs that could help me with the plan . Once I arrived in 1945 , I quickly jumped into action , setting up my mechs around Hitler 's bunker in a manner that made them appear like a secret defence force that only I knew about . I set my mechs up to guard Hitler 's hideout and then triggered an alarm . This alerted the Nazi guards and caused them to flee , leaving Hitler alone inside . At this point , I quickly triggered my mechs to enter the bunker and swarm Hitler , making it impossible for him to escape . With him securely contained , I stepped in , determining that he should not have the choice to take his own life and end the suffering of many . I then took him out of the bunker and into a nearby time-travelling ship , which I had conveniently pre-staged before my arrival . Once the ship had taken my captive to the future , I followed behind , sending out a message that Hitler had been successfully contained and would never be permitted to return . I had won the championship , and Hitler was securely contained for the rest of time .

At first , you do n't know what to do with it . You 're hesitant to touch it , because you do n't know what it will do . But eventually , and hesitantly , you reach out to take it . At first , it feels strange and alien to you . It 's like your body is a few steps behind your mind in recognizing the emotion . But as you allow yourself to relax , you feel a warmth spreading through your chest and a lightness in your head . You let yourself smile , to try and savor the moment . You 've never been so happy in your life . You feel free and content , like a burden has been lifted off your shoulders and you can finally take a step towards the future . You understand now what it means to be content ; to be happy ; to be alive . You do n't know how to thank the person who donated it to you , but you are grateful and promise yourself that you will pass the emotion on . You 've learned the value of joy and will never forget how much it changed your life . You know now that it is possible to feel happy and you will never take it for granted .
I won first place in the Killing Hitler competition last year by taking an original and creative approach . I stumbled upon a time machine in a forgotten attic and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to try and stop Hitler from ever coming to power . I traveled back to the year 1913 and infiltrated a young Hitler 's inner circle of friends . Over the course of a few months , I slowly began poisoning the entire group with a small dose of arsenic . After about a month , the group all fell violently ill from the cumulative effect of the poison . Unfortunately , Hitler was the only one who recovered from the illness , but the damage was done ; Hitler was diagnosed with a permanent case of Parkinson 's Disease . I had successfully ensured that he would n't be able to maintain control and power due to his illness , thus effectively eliminating his chances of becoming dictator . My strategy paid off and I was crowned the champion , winning first place in the competition .
Prologue . The sun rose above the horizon , casting a warm light and glittering across the tranquil lake , while a gentle breeze rustled the trees surrounding it . It was a beautiful morning , and the birds were in full song . The small village of Benina was stirring as the people began their daily routines , but among them was one who was restless . The young girl , named Mina , had been living in Benina for the past seven years , ever since her family moved away from their home in the big city . Mina had always been a curious , adventurous girl and was eager to explore the world beyond her small home . She awoke extra early that day , with an eagerness to explore the land and yearning to find something new . Mina made her way down to the lake , her bare feet taking her across the damp grass . When she arrived at the shore , she stood at the edge of the lake and spun in circles , taking in the beauty of the morning and the peaceful stillness of the water . After a few moments of silence , a single thought ran through her head – she wanted something more than the mundane routine of her life . With that , she grabbed her worn bag , which held a few belongings , and made her way into the forest surrounding the lake . Little did she know that today would be the start of a journey that would change her life – and the world – forever .
Once upon a time , there was a small village tucked away on the side of a mountain . The villagers were a happy , peaceful people and their lives were filled with joy . One day , a mysterious stranger appeared in the village . He had a long grey beard , long pointy ears and bright twinkling eyes . He spoke in a deep , rumbling voice , claiming to be a wizard . The villagers were skeptical , but they were also curious . The wizard told the villagers that he could grant them three magical wishes . He warned them that the wishes had to be taken seriously and must not be used for evil - if they were , it could have disastrous consequences . The villagers deliberated for some time , trying to come up with the perfect three wishes . Eventually , they decided to wish for a plentiful supply of clean water , food and shelter . The wizard smiled , thanked them for their wise decision and then vanished with a puff of smoke . The villagers were amazed at the wizard ’ s magic . True enough , the next day the village was overflowing with clean water , food , and shelter . The villagers were relieved and happy . They thanked the wizard and vowed to use their wishes responsibly and make the most of their new gifts . In return , they would always be kind and generous to their fellow villagers and never forget how the wizard ’ s magic changed their lives . The story spread throughout the land and the villagers were forever known as the most helpful and kind-hearted people in the kingdom .
There had been rumors among the people of the city for years ; whispers of a secret , unex-plainable power . It was something no one was able to understand , something no one had ever seen before . It was the power of the one they had simply come to call ‘ Number One ’ . Nobody knew who Number One was , not even Number One themselves . Every attempt to find out had been fruitless ; for the inhabitants of the city , Number One was unreachable , unassailable , and feared . The city was full of those with extraordinary abilities , from levitation to electrokinesis and beyond , and each person was assigned a rank based on their power level . Ranking number one was a position that had been empty more than it had been filled , as no one had been able to reach that level of strength until now . It seemed as though no one was ever going to get close to Number One ’ s level of power , and the people of the city had all but given up hope . That was until something strange started to happen . People higher than Number One ’ s rank started turning up dead , drained of all the power they had acquired . Rumors circulated quickly and soon it became crystal clear ; somehow , someone was killing the people of higher rank in order to obtain their power . Outraged , the city ’ s leaders attempted to put a stop to the carnage by launching a manhunt for its perpetrator . With each death , it became a little more obvious that Number One was the one behind the killings . Yet , no one had any real proof and the mystery of their identity remained unsolved . Then , one day , a group of brave individuals ventured deep inside the city ’ s sewers in search of the truth . After hours of searching , they finally came face to face with the power behind the murders ; it was Number One . The group discovered that Number One ’ s power was something far greater than anyone else ’ s . It was the power to teleport , to move between places instantaneously . With this power , Number One had been able to silently drain away the power of those of higher rank and take it as their own . After this discovery , all of the people of the city were in shock ; they had never seen power like this before . Despite the law , many in the city came to respect and admire the mysterious power of Number One
I awoke with a start , the early morning sun shimmering in my eyes . My groggy mind foggy and unclear , yet my heart was full of anticipation . Dreams of glory , honour and success , all of which I would yet achieve . My bliss was soon to be shattered , as reality came in quick succession . The bed was too hard , the room too small , my energy felt sapped away . A sense of dread crept upon me ; this was n't the place I belonged . The feeling of helplessness was hard to bear , so I decided to take action . The clock ticked , now the time was nigh , I had to take a stand . Rising from that room and going forth into a new life ahead . Bravely I embraced all the possibilities , seeking the path less travelled . The journey was taxing , the route complicated and toil relentless . But my desire kept me going , toward the promised land I saw . The hardships were surpassed , the goals set became achievements . Success had come but at a price and I felt numb to it all . A moment of respite , peace in a veil of quietude . Thoughts of complacence , yet a will to explore more . Swallowing the pain , I pushed onward , determined to explore . A whisper of hope , a flicker of life all I had left to rely on . Fear ...

The sun shone brightly through the window , lighting up the room in a warm , golden hue . He was already awake despite the early hour , lying quietly in the stillness of the morning . His gaze was fixed on the ceiling , thoughts racing and drifting in careless , chaotic swirls . He wondered if it would ever be the same again – their friendship , the laughter , the good times – or was it all gone , swept away in a turbulent tide of misunderstanding and harsh words ? Slowly he swung his feet over the edge of the bed and standing , he crossed the room to the window . Pulling back the curtains , he watched as the sun continued to climb into the sky , its rays gradually warming the air around him .

She only said she loved him . Karen was walking down the street with her young daughter when she stopped and looked up at a tall building . Every Tuesday , she made her way to the building with her daughter , just to sit and watch the window where her husband had last stood , watching his little family many years ago before he died . She would remember their last moments together , and tears would fill her eyes . This particular Tuesday , things were a bit different . She noticed a silhouette in the window and realized it was the same figure that she saw every Tuesday , but his face was a bit clearer . As she looked up at the figure , he put his finger over his lips and pointed in her direction . She waved and turned away . It was n't her husband , but her heart still skipped a beat . When she returned home , she thought about the figure in the window for hours . She knew it was n't her husband , but she also knew that it was someone deeply important to her . The next day , she found out that it was her husband 's best friend . She learned that her husband had confided in him about his love for her . His friend had told her that the last words he ever spoke to him were , `` She only said she loved him . '' Karen could tell that the man in the window had been trying to tell her that her husband had known and felt her love for him , but also wanted her to know that she had never spoken the words out loud . She vowed to never take for granted the love she had for her husband , and to make sure to express her love out loud to those that she cared for .
The scene in front of you is confusing , but there you both are—past and present you—standing together in a bright light , surrounded by peace . There is no animosity or judgement in the air , only a gentle understanding that needs to be explored . You reach out and touch both your faces , feeling the warmth of past pain and lessons learned .

Finally , you offer a simple apology , pouring out your heart into the words you say , and vowing to be better—in the past , present , and future . Forgiveness comes from both versions of yourself , and the embrace that follows is all encompassing . You part as old selves , the path to Heaven open before you . Your footsteps now carrying you ever closer to the peace and joy that awaits in Heaven .

The sun shone brightly and the sky was a huge , pure blue . There was a soft gentle wind blowing and the air was filled with the aroma of fresh blooms and herbs . The peacefulness of the morning , however , was soon disrupted by a group of miners arriving at a distant hill . It was a noisy procession . The miners had come to extract valuable minerals and ore from the mountainside . They had brought with them all kinds of tools and equipment , and piled them up near the base of the hill . The miners wasted no time and immediately began their work with loud grunts , singing , and the clanging of metal hammering on rock . As the day wore on , the air grew thick with the dust raised by the hard labor . Even from afar , one could make out the figure of a lone man standing on top of the hill , observing everything that was happening . He was a mysterious figure - cloaked in dark , heavy fabrics , his face obscured by a hood . He watched every move the miners made with a stoic expression , his gaze cold and calculating . One could almost sense him studying the situation like a chess master , waiting for the right opportunity to strike . Who was this mysterious man ? What was he up to ? This was a question that many would soon come to ponder as events unfolded in the coming days , leading up to a fateful confrontation between miners and mystery .

I staggered back in bemused shock at the unexpected feeling that surged through me . As I sampled this newfound emotion , my heart twitched and I felt a spark of happiness ignite within me . It took a few moments before I regained my composure and the awareness that this feeling was not coming from me- it had been donated to me ! I struggled to find the words to express my appreciation for the generous act of kindness , looking up gratefully at the stranger who had contributed such a gift from their own well of emotion . I could only stand there stunned , reaping emotions from this newfound understanding of the world around me that I had only vaguely understood before . Over the coming days and months , I found myself growing healthier and happy as I explored and grew with these donated emotions . I could never thank the anonymous donor enough , truly my life had been changed and was so much richer for it . Once this happiness was successfully incorporated into my life , I began to notice other more rarefied emotions bubbling up- pleasure , contentment , contentment- as if the happiness had opened the floodgates in my soul to other more complex feelings . The strange power of this donation still hums within me as I Reflect with a sense of accomplishment over having been given new roles beyond the dry receptacle of emotionless Nothingness . I savor every moment of these newly felt Judgments and accept and understand the notion that in life we are wiser to accept donations of that which binds and unifies us , than the toxic shame of what enslaves us . I have never shied away from sadness , fear and regret since feeling the hand of a better life through this kindness , I cherish being part of a world worth donating emotions to and championing new routes of feeling empathy and belonging .
Once upon a time , there was a young woman named Hilda who lived deep in the woods surrounded by nature . Even though she was alone , Hilda was always content with her life and accepted it whole-heartedly . She had all that she needed to survive from the land around her , and was constantly in awe of the magical spirits she occasionally encountered in her travels . One day , as she set out for her morning walk , Hilda stumbled across a peculiar looking portion of the forest with trees unlike any she had seen before . The colors were vibrant , the branches and trunks glowed , and it seemed to exude some type of extraordinary energy . Cautiously , Hilda investigated the peculiar area of the forest , taking in all that was around her . She noticed not only were the trees strange , but there were other strange creatures living among them . Everything appeared to be uncharacteristically alive , from the beetles to the frogs to even the lichen growing on the trunk of a tree . It was as if she had stumbled into an enchanted fantasy world ! With complete curiosity and wonder Hilda strode into the middle of the forest and was greeted by an ethereal deer wearing golden antlers . The deer came before Hilda , bowed his head to the young woman , and invited her to a secret party within the forest ’ s depths . Intrigued , Hilda hesitantly followed the deer , winding through the grand trees and along the winding path within the enchanted forest . As they reached the opening of a cavern , a strange , yet captivating group of faeries , nymphs and druids was gathered around . The human as well as the creatures invited her , sharing in their merriment and merriment of the music and dancing . Hilda spent a divine night with the magical creatures , drank sweet wines from their enchanted cups , and listened to their wise words of ancient wisdom . As the night gradually came to an end , Hilda left the creature 's gathering with an enchanted arrow she had been gifted . Whenever danger was close the arrow was said to twinkle a bright light and ward it away . Back in her small abode , Hilda could not shake the questioning feeling that lingered inside of her as she remembered the bewitching slumber party . Was she dreaming ? Or , was possible that she had just stumbled upon an actual Fey gathering ? She , however , did not
It was saffron orange , a calmness in the Lakeland 's meadows and hollows . Over its mists feathers drifted brooding in a gentle quietatude . She waited , breaths softening the night with orchid blue hope . 'Maybe it 's better stuck here ' , fleeting memories eroding determination . Apart , but never truly divided , a bridge between two things unfinished . Pain hung in ever-coiling mists , too expansive to grasp , too ephemeral to be shared . Inhale redemption healing her aching soul , exhale gentle whispers of love . Here , where days dissipated in two patterns of truth , she waited for something profound . Yearning .

At first , you are taken aback by the sight of yourself and feel completely overwhelmed . You know that you have many wrongdoings and shortcomings . Yet you also recognize the love you have for yourself , and the strength and courage of which you have faced life and done your best to make the best of it . Mustering up your courage , you first start with owning up and apologizing to yourself for everything you ’ ve done wrong . In return , the other you accepts your apology and acknowledges the efforts you have made . Both you show genuine empathy towards each other . All the shame , regret , and fears start to dissolve as you come to terms with what has transpired , connecting deeper to each other . Patience with yourselve fills your heart and you slowly and lovingly forgive yourself . Seeing this seemingly impossible scene right in front of you , the gate to Heaven opens and you step forward , holding your heart with full forgiveness ..
You are taken aback as you stand face to face with your own reflection , feeling the weight of the regrets and wrongdoings you committed in life .

Your reflection smiles at you in unconditional love , understanding , and support , allowing you to step forward into the light and enter Heaven .
You stand in silence , but you feel like all your past mistakes , regrets , and sorrows have accumulated and are causing an invisible aura of despair that was hovering around you both but that you were the only one that could sense . You see things you never noticed before like how some of your sharp words have hurt and damaged relationships . And you surprisingly notice how even when you tried to forgive yourself , some part of you was always keeping a grudge and tormenting you inside . You try to speak but years of keeping it held in has made it difficult for you . Your lips seal and your throat tightens like someone ’ s placing pressure from the outside . You notice you reflexively reaching out to the figure with tears starting to fall down your cheeks , grieving for all the years of wonderful moments you could have had if only you had listened to yourself and your inner knowing . In the middle of your sorrow , an aftermath of deep peace and appreciation for yourself fills you . From the other side of this exchange , you feel an unconditional understanding of the journey that drove you here . You breathe in the recognition and you feel the acceptance radiating off the figure , making you feel both misunderstood and understood all at once . With those arms so invitingly outstretched , despite the fear that lingered in you , you let yourself be embraced . It feels like home - old familiar certainty blended with something entirely new and different .

Explain why you think that this person , yourself , is standing in front of you as the person you hurt the most . I believe that I am standing in front of me because what I have done is not only hurt those around me , but I have hurt myself . I have had moments where I have put too much stress on myself , fail to take care of myself emotionally and physically , and neglect myself due to struggles and tribulations of life . In reality , that selfishness creates most of the pain I feel and the pains I home on others , as a way to not blaming myself in the end . And I realize , I will never see heaven until I learn to give myself grace , satisfaction , and redemption from the person I ’ ve hurt the most – myself .

The Kingdom , fallen hard , now lay depleted and licking wounds until Murryang , enraptured for her wise deeds of courage and calm , became its fate deciding queen . Her audiences erred in their assess and deferment ; commanding rule when tumultuous peace appeared unthinkable shortly proceeded change .

Everyone knew what this day was ; it was The Araldi Graduation Ceremony of the high-ranking super humans - the ones the mortals thought were gods . Most of the young audience members had families and friends that would graduate rank tonight - a shining emblem of honor amongst all those born with innate gifts . Standing just below them on the stage was a single boy with startling electric green eyes gazing over the patrons without moving a muscle – not one twitch from his still body suggested the boy was paying attention to anyone or anything around him . However , rumbling whispers among who stood divided the attention away , obviously aware of his astounding status . He was a Phenomena who had managed level one of the Araldi-ranking system – otherwise known as the leader of all the special beings within the city . Many did not know which authority he had been exacting to acquire such a high rank so soon but… What was known was – he was even more remarkable for the reason that nobody had discovered his real superhuman gift , at least not that the gossipers had caught onto yet . The true mysterious gift was unclear to even seers , as it appears on the date of testing it flipped with some undiscovered intensity amongst its energy bank that displayed it into something beyond obtainable to record . Others believed he a geometer with abnormal sensory adeptness and strategic inborn insight but the boy ’ s actual power seemed deeply untouched despite frequently noticed precautions he enact each time he mentioned something or did a certain about-face move , preparing for trouble that reality was too respectful to give him at that chance yet . A light hit gathered and emitted lighting a spotlight directed around like a beacon , heading into a corner within the stadium the sussmendouts and lens 'd beam pointed to the corner – ungrabbing what made the floor wooden , separating for the ballast were taking uncover and flight fast in secrecy , stumbling across the letters spelt in the low ground : zobres - a secret code containing a special cut forbidden from directly being named by power secanted –but , could be realized in darkness pulled back much like the wooden sheet freeing within spots like line .

That fateful day , as the morning sun began to climb skies washed in strange hues ofColor and far-off winds brought promises of what was looming in the future , five great dragons transformed the fates of those living amongst them , and set out on an Epic Journey which would test their courage , strength and highest ideals . The chosen five rode valiantly atop these magnificent creatures , abandoning their home cities to embark upon seemingly unending tasks and trials . Each journey forced them further and further into wild lands and places unseen beyond the civil comforts and protection of home . Each following led to different splashes of reality .

Josh Meaney had lived a relatively mundane existence . A high school freshman who 's group of friends liked video games , but steered away from parties , he often found himself looking for something more exciting , something different , a journey , an experience .

By now , Josh assumed this would be the right pocket for filling to the brim an otherwise closed off idle life , albeit , pulled against a unescapable calling yet mysteries like torrential rains protecting too deeper instincts waiting unfounded nonetheless : finding out exactly whom governs all the underhanded secrets of Camp Cosmos was buried deceitfully , ever-growing more vast . Maybe answering Meesuan 's earnest advice , Josh crafted a plan of his own , nurturing with the AUGE along only those prospects capable of exploring

Prologue The voice was coming from thousands of miles away . It echoed down the dark hallways and up through the worn and jagged rocks . It thundered like a distant storm accompanying a bleak and starless night . But it was calling out to a particular , unmistakable , destination . Time had run out . Every calculated beat of her weakened heart pounded against her decaying chest - echoing in unison with the voice that urged her to try- urging her'one last time'to silence the bleary lights around her . Painfully , her heavy eyes opened to darkness , and waves of painful familiarity had coursed through her body jolting her soul behind her veins . The shadowy world around her seemed imprinted against the canvas , forever frozen within a timeless atmosphere that was almost holy . It called to her from beyond the distant screams- from another consciousness dwelling inside of her own . It seemed perfectly fitting that underneath the billowing clouds and beyond the blinding nights pitch , obscured by frail human ears and beneath the blinding colors is what gracefully awaited her - perfection and her second home . The voice was calling her home - back to Saraiya .

Once there were two friends , Martha and Ann . They had known each other for many years and had grown very close . Summer was nearly over , and Martha and Ann decided to take one last spontaneous vacation together to a tropical island . The small island appeared to be made entirely of sand , with lush vegetation and sparkling ocean waves invitingly lapping at its beaches . Martha and Ann were filled with excitement as they took an efficient , buxom pleasure-craft to the shore , docking atop a postcard paradise . They spent their days swimming in the salty-sweet waters , walking around the quaint little town , and sharing in endless laughter and genuine friendship . On the last night of their wonderful journey , from the magnificent setting of the golden sand beach , they talked throughout the night until finally deciding to muse on a topic they always wanted to discuss - the deepest secrets they kept within their hearts . Martha told Ann about the teenage crush she couldn ’ t let go of and Ann cried for that unfounded insecurity , both of them confessing what scared them the most about the other , and allowing each other to strive towards a personal horizon . They would n't be as understanding and liberating friends without this important moment by the ocean , and all wrongs were righted in a never-ending flurry of words , awed gasps , shared intimacies , quietness , embrace and courage fueled by the warm night and the stars above . That 's how sometimes planes fly into picturesque backdrops wherever sand hugs the soft , stretchy lines of oceans and it rocks people with determination and audacity , the kind of friendship that lasts long after trips come back into false mornings , long after sunset litters small pieces of lives stuck onto tissues spotted with tears and lengthy engagement over beautiful equations of existence . So thanked them for those unforgettable summer days - sandy and coconut flavored !

Both taken aback at the idea that ten days could transform a friendship into undeniable trust-tainted resonance that streamed on as strong as the tides could wave forwards and backwards .

Rachel packed her briefcase deftly , donning a wry smirk due to her success . She had doubled her resume 's value and been given the perfect end to her postgraduate year . Her phone lit up constantly in a wild fanfare and she really could n't be prouder today . Two minutes ago nobody spoke her name and now everyone venerated it . Colors that originated inside filled the dusty airplane , clicking away fanciful memories solitarily . Every thought jutted with augmented immense education humming away thoughtful tones . She touched one feather and watched stars twinkle awake deep amongst stellar liberty . Rocketshyne waved errand farewell feeling catholicism find bliss from quirk , embracing childhood inspired wishes stirring euphoria all through Her cup of tea . Dissipating lifetimes conquering challenges arriving wisdom leaps constant , welling fierce cascading horns revolving emotion intensified acuity rising towards hope . Zeal .
It was something that Sarah was feeling all week . A certain nag of worry about what was to come . She left home early that Sunday and had no idea that her world would be flipped upside-down by the day 's end . Frantic waves of fear rolled through her body until she could n't tell up from down , wrong from right or comfort from chaos . The rush of every single moment eventually hugged her , like a full-length succulent novel finally fading into its satisfying and hard-anticipated conclusion . A spark of understanding hummed through her core and she knew then , that things would never be the same .

John Wiley waited impatiently outside . The dark night briefly cloaked him . Pedestrians meandered , oblivious to him . Then music blared as an elevator 's doors opened . Escaping of laughter ravaged the muted silence . Slow song signaled his companion 's descent . Brilliance of her spotlight ignited the dismal mood . Over long table , passionate words cut like knives . Night speedily began to tense yet he felt calm . Faces once soft began to curve strange smirks . Extravagantly grew every glint of her eyes . Glowing tenderly , softer and quieter he saw . Cross purposes frozen in cinematic carvings . Imagination slowly intertwined mutual dreaminess . Everlasting desire lay itself uncovered and whispered love .
Approaching yourself can be daunting in many ways-emotional , psychological , philosophical-all the while on a spiritual curtain call . But reflecting on everything you 've been through-forgiven and still present actions-interrogating yourself proves that maybe a conversation can not outweigh reconciliatory remarks you swore to say or have felt eluded by bitter memories yet when freely actual act of contrition shows that words may skitter around avoiding an etiquette to restore whatever relationships lie where they have situated so graciously & wholeheartedly.It might take cross processing moments , mute comforts of pressing warm realization of contrariness & of understanding sorrow along journey in remembrance farther engaging more than laughter , sharing broken vessels further persuading broken conditions others on further transformationss to inflict natures of chastisement acquired when it comes to learning distinctions , innocence lasting & furthermore excellence .

I know being a kid 's imaginary friend was something special , and feel proud of all the adventures that we shared together . The lessons that we learned , and the stories that were made , they were formed with imagination unique to us . Although , this journey was all too fleeting , and though painful to accept , the time has come for us to say goodbye to one another . My beloved young friend , I can not express how humbling it is to grow with you even from afar . Disappearing might feel sad , yet as difficult as it is , to remain would be cruel to us both . Through this goodbye , I hope that you always be bold and imaginative , while courageously conquering and defining who you are . Farewell my sweet , imaginative companion .
It can be hard to accept when our young friends are starting to grow up ; those days of innocence gone with each passing year . But even though I may not be around in the day-to-day physical hurt shell , do n't ever forget the memories we have created : running till we sweat and bending sticks into useful contraptions , igniting invisible fires in pools of hope . Those snapshots of unparalleled childhood joy , will last forever x breathing fun into our cherished moments gives edge to their unfolding life story . As for me , I have n't left , all I 've done is tucked away into a memory box for special keeping . That said , do n't hesitate to take that lasting moment , colour glitterbright and resurrect my smiling countenance just when it all gets tricky .. Oh it is appreciated ! Even an old imaginary friend loves your magical homage call . ( It really bolsters neglected poor relations like us , because it 's mighty special when we get an astronomical winkling out from no-wise bright heavenly scouts ..... ) Thank you . Have a grooving super joyfilled light !

Ava had apprehensions about telling Mitch she loved him . Curiously optimistic , she unlocked her rickety front door to greet him warmly that dry summer afternoon amid the golden heat of final days . Her insecurity caused tensions in her quiet brave heart , driving-out its courage darker than anything she had ever hoped came . Finally gathering firm powerful words on the tip of her blue painted lips , Ava revealed silently to him how much she ‘ only ’ loved him in so many galaxies fewer and better moments away . Brilliant crimson burst within him and now taking root , he gave thanks with warm smiles enjoying he rich delight set in his serening heart forever as they spoke a dialect far beyond human discourse — surpassing angels , attending stars and two eternal summers engaged in human-shaped roses quickly fresh in what new and dazzling orchestrations love had bequeathed peace upon time unassisted as leaving diamonds neath the lovers living final sentence , `` She said she ‘ only ’ loved him .

Once upon a time there lived an old man who lived alone in modest cabin tucked in the foothills of a distant and abandoned mountain range . But though he had only himself for company reality never crossed the line of lonely . On the abundant eve 's he enjoyed companionship found in watching the clouds wrestle the sky , testing forever to spin worlds atop still playground of clear blue . Across the hills country children would sometimes endure curious pathways come ever daring to knock plays arms echoing truths ; mouths gossiping untold family mystery 's endlessly extolled up with bubbling distention willing life beneath .

Once upon a time idyllic river ran , loved by the people migrating there . Its mirrored windows welcomed fairies sages and shamans who relied on the current teachings like their own heritage . Apples dancing off against nets searching for purity spurred on inquiries that questioned the mainstream narrative . Non-linear thought contemplated clearly discovering concealed bonds that echoed throughout silence . Then , wisdom .

First paragraph : John never expected to leave green pastures of his homeland to join a guarded expedition setting out into the unforgiving marsh of the rough Malapaya Forests . Its denizens , consumed in their struggles for survival , had few outward hospities for oathwives sworn to serve them as interprets - said methods were largely unheard of within city walls . Last paragraph : One marshy nightmarish itinerary passed followed by another , sinking deeper into an unfamiliar world . Most days it slept - unobserved and unsuspecting - everything strange and frightening yet undeniably liberating ; and sometimes the sprawling limbs of the Malapaya Forests opened up abundance for those willing to give it a venture . But only by fully embracing this accidental fervent army will John pry back the life force buried in the Marshes ’ silence , find hope within his uncertain origins , and seek refuge in something previously unwritten .
I had traveled back a decade when Hitler originally rose to power . I introduced myself as an visiting diplomat , and got himself shockingly close to Hitler . When I got the chance , while standing right in front of the Nazi leader in broad daylight , I dramatically removed a hand mirror about as wide as my chest . Taking advantage of the stunned stillness , I knocked him across the foreheads using the flashlight in one fatal swoop . Inc money this impossible yet ultimate rick grand prize had at awe ; I watched Hitler lay still in his own pool of blood , at the hands of the tried and true courageous royal me .

The fun times can always live in your heart forever . That 's the great part about friendships - they are sacred and always with us , everywhere on the universe on echoes of good things . Everyone finds imaginary friends at one point or another and it 's a great part of growing up .
At first , the sensation was confusing , and I did n't even recognize it for what it was . As time passed , the sensation kept ticking away inside of me , peeling off the layers of dark and bleak that had become my comfort zones for so many years .

I always wondered what my future held , but of course I had no idea . We never do – that 's the perfect mystery of life . All I knew is that somedays , I 'd look up at the evening sky , tossed that familiar main street and wish I could enter a different reality .

Then one night , quite unknown to me or anybody else in the city for that matter , something truly majestic as appeared in the midnight hour . Crystal beams of soft lightning waited in a halo above , standing separately but praising Mother Nature strength and might ...

I won last year 's time-travel tournament to kill Hitler by going back in 1919 , right after Hitler came back despondent from being rejected in his first examination to pursue Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts . Earlier examinations were led by Japanese-born editor and private art diagnost Herbert Spighters . Con boys included Hitler ’ s soon-to-be opera singer and admirer Winifried Fröhlich and Ferdinand Holtkaomoi , universally recognized Fauvism and Post-adulation of graphic arts . Hitler – despairing , beside himself and become completely obsessed – was quit jealous of Fröhlich ’ s extreme growing admiration by associating trends caused by Spighters official disagreement of him . What instead brought him finally enraged was praise toward intense art experimentation from Herbert , coupled in works fascinated and mesmerized with primary essence similariments behind August Dingler and Gustav Klimsch classes ( 2017-19 ) about woodblock visualization applied among food state interpretations where extensive intake variables implemented by foreign textures based upon diverse zest roles savaged as consumption depict purpose among inner mouth gravütarian sensation methods basically because added and mechiadonal pleasure eministration - associated with his disdain post failure diagnist influence composed up gastronesophii .

It was a strange experience . When they handed me the envelope , I felt a sudden lightness pass through my bones as an unfamiliar feeling softened my features . I slowly opened the envelope , and a soothing humility caressed my entire being . It felt as if a ray of bursting sunshine flooded a tenebrous room with a glowing detoxifying beam . Seeping insight and clogged pathways that were pressed against my pulsating spirit quivered as memory threaded messages dispersing their obstructist counterparts forever .

Paragraph 1 Gwendolyn was trekking across the desolate terrain when she came upon a mercurial lake close to the desert oasis . Remnants of an atriopsis bees knees could also be observed - bulba predavdale in fragments , dispersing across the crispy surface amongst a boero garnet tide clinging to unknown intricacies of the past shaped waterboard . Paragraph 2 She surveyed the area cautiously despite the area being known for sightings of silver briar and coligans . Before the curtain of inseta began to be reflected prism like upon the winding obscuria , an emothem drifted by but quickly evaporated before further details could clearly be discerned . Not knowing what to expect , feigning courage was second nature for Gwendolyn as her mission suffered interne rivalry toward criteism but at what cost ?

Walt never meant to hand her all his love notes when their conversation descended into an argument . Loving shapes and syllables crafted with intention seemed insignificant as panic whipped fury and his brain overloaded . Despite uncertain roars , she unfolded letters like planes strewn wrongly on burgundy night . Still crumpled amid tears and shattered glances , enough intention remained spiraling silently between their souls - something to restore sparkling chance and future symmetry . Walt made sleepless steps into every dimension between , eagerly reaching for the impossible sum between love .

Barclay Norwood had been living with a weight on his shoulders .

By forgiving yourself for every mistake you ever made , listening and accepting all your faults while showing compassion for yourself and not being overwhelmed by anger , racism , judgments , or disappointing culture views , freeing your soul of remorse , rewoking trust by essential spirit , becoming the best of what you are already—something magical happens . You brought joy back from pain , you found Heaven by believing in yourself .

Edit : typos/missed word . Day 1 The aliens took me from my bed in the pitch black night and began the terrifying process of full initiation . Day 7 They held me down with straps and began the disgusting ... shameful procedure that would go on for days . I pleaded tearfully for them to stop over and over and over again but to no avail . Day 12 They speak in a strange language that I could not understand and taunted me with laughter . Why were they subjecting me to this ungodly torture that I would n't wish on anyone ? Why did they choose me to endure this painful embarrassment that destroyed my mind ? How long are they going to force me to keep my eyes open ? ! Day 24 As the process continues I 'm strangely becoming numb to the broadcasts . The sick torture programs are getting easier to stomach now . Day 37 I unexpectedly laughed during one of the programs today . The aliens are happy with my progress now . Day 48 I 'm actually beginning to understand their language . Day 52 I enjoy the broadcasts a lot . They bring me much joy . Day 55 They explained the broadcasts . I understand now . The broadcasts . Anime .
It had been two weeks since he left and so far he was surprised that he had survived so long . But he was hungry and cold most of the time and had to be careful not to attract suspicion . He was starving today from less food than usual but at least he had shelter from the rain . Later that day one stranger was nice enough to give him two dollars but she was chatty . She offered to buy him coffee and some donuts from Dunkin Donuts which he happily accepted . He wondered if his annoyance was showing at all the personal questions she was asking . `` You look to young to be begging on the streets , '' she said with curiosity . `` It does n't matter how old I look what 's important is that I left . '' She changed the topic by asking if he wanted to hang out . He wondered why she would want to hang out with strangers . `` If you want to , although that 's kind of weird to . '' `` How is it weird though , '' she asked with confusion . `` Your a stranger I met thirty minutes ago . '' `` Then let 's not be strangers , I 'll start . '' `` You are one strange pretty lady . '' `` Why thank you , I 'm flattered . '' `` You did n't introduce yourself . '' I 'm Geneva , you ? '' `` I 'm Maison . '' `` Nice . ''
Slowly I pull into the driveway , noticing that there is an extra car in the spot where I usually park . “ Who is this , ” I wonder , hoping that our friend Dave had stopped by in his travels through the area . As I walk quietly through the door , a trail of clothing greets me , and the sounds of pleasure . I enter the hallway , terrified of what I was about to see but desperately hoping not to . Tears stream down my face as I cross the living room , God I can smell them ! My heartbeat racing in my chest , I feel alive and violent ; They will both pay . First to the gun cabinet I sneak , unlocking and grabbing my trusty , loaded weapon . My mind is racing , remembering our vows , till her death we will part . Cocking weapon , I again cross the room , my cheeks flushed with rage . Countless steps I climb , fear and turmoil grip me harder yet . Is this right , or have I made the wrong choice ? Almost there , chest is burning , aching with this burden . Pushing the door open reveals the bitter truth . My wife and her lover , embracing , naked . I pull the gun and shoot . Oh , what have I done ? Is that my son ? His arms , broken . Both dead . Fuck .
The heart monitor marked the slowing of her heart beats , the beeps getting farther and farther apart each passing minute . The looks from the nurses told me it was only a matter of time until it was all over . I picked absentmindedly at a loose string hanging from the sling holding my arm tight against my body . I had n't seen the car coming , because I had been yelling into the back seat at her . I could n't even remember what I had been yelling about , but it did n't matter right now . She looked so small lying in the hospital bed , her golden curls on the pillow . I wished for a way to take her home , to make her safe again . The heart monitor beeped out a warning that the nurse quickly shut off . Her eyes fluttered open and my heart leapt with a momentary hope . I wished to apologize , to tell her it was my fault . Her eyes closed again , and my sorrow ballooned once more . I prayed the way only a broken man can . Nobody was saying anything , we all just waited . The doctor walked in the room silently . Was time starting to run out ? She opened her eyes again . I smiled at her . It was happening . Hearts stopped . Childless .
It had been years since she had looked for his face in a crowd , but she had heard he returned . She was n't sure she would be able to find him , she was n't sure she would remember his face correctly . It was her hope , however , that their time together shone through her mind brighter than their time apart . When they were younger , she could find him in a group of thousands , she had been confident . Life had happened and now it had been sixteen years since she 'd even seen his face . Oh , she hoped he 'd recognize her , what with her newly styled hair and aged face . He was talking with a mutual friend of theirs , and her feet started moving . Her nerves shook her to the bones -- she hoped he did n't blame her . Marriage and moving had not been in her cards at the time . She had n't meant to hurt him when she told him no . He had seemed to understand her reasons at the time . It did n't meant he would n't hurt over her choice . She never wanted to say goodbye to him . When their eyes met , all was forgiven . Her eyes shone brightly at him . Noise faded into the background . He reached for her.Their hands clasped . She smiled . `` Hi . ''
The sun glittered high above the glinting armies , a heavenly witness to the lives that would shortly be littered there . The rolling hills , soon to be muddied ; the lush green grass , soon to be lost amidst knots of bodies . He tried to swallow , to force down that dry lump in his throat that refused to go away . Shoving him forwards , smiling , they said , “ We honour you , ” ; “ cannon fodder , ” said the others , those haggard survivors . He swallowed again , gasping , gripping the hilt of his virgin sword to still his shaking fingers . Suddenly a brazen blast , startling him as he was nearly pushed over to be trampled . Echoing across the gap , the drone of pipes , as both lines charged to meet . A crash as they met , then a red haze as his brothers died . Somehow , he survived that first charge , and then the fighting broke up . Men fell all around him , hunched over in the blood mud . He couldn ’ t find his sword , he had just had it ! It was his first battle , really just a skirmish . He couldn ’ t die here , so far from home . Who ’ d tell his mother , his brave-faced mother ? He cowered behind his shield , sobbing . He couldn ’ t see , couldn ’ t think . A towering silhouette swung . Suddenly a scream . His own . Silence .
I had fun writing this story because my sentences are usually loquacious run-on disasters and I have n't written a story in quite awhile . I Made This Title 21 Words Long Because I Want to Savor the Ability to Write Long Sentences While it Lasts I sit here shaking as I compose my last words , my limbs entangled within the ghastly black maw of immortality . They ’ ve been carefully composed in relentless aquatic mental reverberations , knowing they will be the last bulwark against this curse . All selfishness has an equal retaliation- a karmic doctrine I no longer scoff off like a beggar ’ s pleas . It is described in tales of mythic idolatry by the covetous and sagacious consternation by the wise . A cursed object rumored to halt the hounds of death at some terrible yet equal price . With predictable idiocrasy , I scrutinized countless vistas of antediluvian obscurity to locate the feared talisman . Intentionally I omit a description , fearing some other fool will acquire its mad affliction . But as I will grudgingly impart , it was emblazoned with an unsettling depiction . “ Fools who desert counsel shall reap eternal hindrance From vices forcibly taken . For Mercy deserts thieves who lack ignorance , Who are knowingly mistaken. ” Now I burn in a mortal hellfire of ironic atrophy . Sadly , I can not continue , for my voice is decaying . Fate is far worse than the hellhound ’ s baying . Decay is unavoidable for every mortal life . Now I ’ ll toil through endless strife . A price for every purchase . Imprisoned not by death . But in mind . My words . Taken .
I swirled the glass in my hand , feeling the coldness in my fingers , the ice clinking in the heavy tumbler . He is stretched out on the bed , the smooth curve of his back across the crumpled sheets , toes pointing . It had been a fortuitous meeting earlier , an empty seat and welcoming smile , our conversation had just clicked . He spoke of love and loss but was still optimistic , I smiled and said he was beautiful . We moved to short cocktails and told each other secrets that only true strangers can tell . My hand on his knee and the easy laughter , I suggested drinks in my room . The urgent kissing in the elevator , he felt my wetness , fumbling with door keys . As he turned and slipped from his clothes I held the bottle firmly . With a crack and muffled thud he collapsed gracelessly to the floor . The ropes from my bag stretched him beautifully across the bed . The gag and toys could provide us both with pleasure . But the blade would provide pleasure only for one . An athletic physique , his chest gently rising , falling . Unconscious movements which the ropes firmly restrained . His eyes open , dazed then fearful . Muscles bulge but without effect . I moved closer , whispering . “ Are you ready ? ” Muffled screams . Blood .
I got my nickname from a game I used to play with my family when our company would get bored . Our typical company seemed to always be my brother 's girlfriends , sister 's boyfriends , father 's war friends and mother 's gossip frenemy 's . So now , one could imagine a certain household , similar to mine on a typical trailer park Saturday night . The word typical being used to describe my gravel-laden trailer park , Is atypical from inside looking out . Inside , as a teen undergoing changes , the graveled parking lot kept caged , abusers with abundant prey . Abusers and users actually , though one could be a user and not be an abuser . On that same note ; an abuser , by their fundamental nature , must be a user . This mixed perilously with my trailer housing seven human magnets of varying strength . My home was a revolving door of earth parasites , some latched tight . Yet on occasion I would be willing to join our `` company '' .The living-room din would hit a volume that invites inspection . I would awkwardly appear , ghost-like , from my safe place . Our game of choice was a card game . A modified version of spades , called Back-Alley . `` Company '' and chemicals ; rarely ends well . Mine , in the back alley . The irony is thick . My name 's Kathy . My nickname . `` Alley ''
I had never met anyone quite like her , the lonely girl sitting on the bench across the sidewalk from me . She was eagerly analyzing her surroundings , taking mental notes ; I couldn ’ t help but walk towards her and introduce myself . “ My name is Anne ” she said with a smile , paying more attention to her surroundings than to me . It stayed this way for months , I could never take her out without her eyes wandering away . She was aware of everything , not ever missing a detail . I was attracted to her attentiveness . “ Anne , ” I said without hesitation . “ What causes you to pay so much attention to everything ? ” “ It is because my eyes are open Jack ” she said without looking at me . After two years , I had asked her to marry me ; she said yes . We started our new lives together , an eventual change coming over me . I saw movements , new outlines formed in place of old ones . “ What is happening ? ” She knew what I was referring to . “ I have helped you Jack , you can see now ” . I stood back , and all colors instantly vanished . All I could see was her , smiling . I understood what she meant . Her eyes were open . Mine were closed . Without sight . Blind .
For what seems like eternity , I have been drowning in an ocean of darkness ; sinking in a sea of despair . My heart , my thoughts , my dreams , my very existence ; gone and washed away by an endless river of misery . Nothing in sight to offer salvation ; no hand reaches out to save this wretched , hollow and worthless life . Flailing mindlessly and gasping for breath , I cry out in utter desperation as my final descent begins . Sinking further and further , I reach unthinkable depths unknown to even the most unbalanced of minds . The waters have me , but will not give me up to inevitable death so quickly . They prolong my torment by creating scenes of my life before my very eyes . The vile waters show me unending guilt and shame ; relentless remorse and regret . I can not look away ; I am subjected to reliving every painful minute . Images of every hurtful thing I had ever caused flowed past . The tears of my children were by far the worst . How long can a soul endure such cruel torture ? With an unheard scream , I welcomed the end . Finally , the dark waters flow inside me . Doing so , they gifted me enlightenment . It was futile to resist . Hopeless to have hope . Pointless to pray . Lost ; forgotten . Oblivion .
Before this very moment , the sands of time were seemingly endless , infinitely flowing at a snails pace our entire life . But now our time was coming to an end , a crack in the hourglass taking all I had left . The grains were pouring out at an alarming rate , and nothing I could do would repair the breach . I gazed into her eyes , like I was peering through the stained glass window to her soul . Though they were looking back , they no longer contained the spark that had fueled our passion . Her green , almond like eyes once glistened in the moonlight on our warm summer nights . I could see them so clearly now , the imperfections I once swore did n't exist . Bags under her eyes told a story that I had never known before . They whispered of the angst she was too proud of admitting to . I lowered my heavy gaze , my fortitude was weaker than before . Tears welled up in my eyes , the pain too great . I forced myself back into her empty , lifeless stare . Her wrinkled hands no longer reached for mine . She sat and waited for Death 's embrace . My best friend , partner in crime . Until death did we part . After all this time ... Time flew by . Sixty years . Goodbye .
The clock never stops , but really there is no reason for the hands to slow , the ominous tick of time . Each motion striking closer to a determined fate , second after second you wait . You start to beg and plead . It goes unnoticed . It carries no weight . Each offering falls upon deaf ears . Another precious second has passed . Darkness finds an eternal friend within that of time , in the end they have the same destination . Motionless you lay , afraid , alone , knowing what waits as the clock rounds effortlessly past another midnight . It fades , the feeling of life that is . Slipping away like a lazy Sunday afternoon . If only you knew to cherish those days , where the clock was n't mocking you . Banished is regret , time does n't care about regret , only the end matters now . 12 The hands motions sound like cracking bones , as the mechanical gears turn . 11 The pressure mounts , ever lasting , like weights on your hollow chest . 10 A light appears out of the darkness , hope fills you . It comes closer , from the darkness a figure appears . Hope fades , the skeletal face radiates certain death . The clock ticks on , time dwindling down . Your soul slips gently from your body . Death is a certainty in life . It moves forward , never stopping . The tick is true . Is n't it funny ? It 's just , Time .
`` You see , limitations are inherent to the very idea of art : creating is framing and framing is , well , creating limits '' `` If creating is framing and framing is creating limits , does n't that mean that framing is framing limits ? `` , I teased . `` Nice wordplay , but if framing is framing limits and creating is framing , then framing becomes creating limits again . It 's all about perspective , a gestalt sort of thing : limits reveal what 's inside , while implying what 's outside '' `` Okay , so here 's some food for thought : suppose a camera has been recording the universe . An omnipresent camera which began recording in the dawn of time , capturing every corner . Every single frame , from every single angle , EVER , has been recorded by it . Now , the entire existence will be recorded , all dimensions considered and whatnot . Through your reasoning , these images , by themselves , ca n't be considered art '' `` They 're not art '' , she said , smiling victoriously , in a heartbeat . `` Just limitless nonsense , a sort of pointless meta existence '' `` What if you could edit the recordings , then ? '' `` I could frame them into art , then '' `` Would you include or exclude this ? '' `` What do you mean , exactly ? '' `` This conversation , of course '' `` I 'd imply it '' `` So ... exclude ? '' `` Limit ''
We grew so used to our comforts , our lethargies , and our addiction to apathy that we forgot how to survive . When oceans rose to our front door and vile plagues could be halted no more , we ceased to be . Once , laughter and love floated down this street - now nothing but the whispering of the last trees . The bitumen surface is adorned with years of moss , for those who once maintained it are gone . The drivers whose cars once drove these roads , their families , friends , and co-workers are all gone . All that remains are concrete monuments to our stupidity , mega corporations ’ names in the sky . A rat scurries from behind a bin , searching desperately for any food - in vain . He is the last of the living , his heart the last to beat . Already , its rhythm has started to slow , drumming the world ’ s final adagio . The rat remembers when mankind ’ s wastefulness would keep him well fed . He remembers the way they would scream and chase him . No longer , now he is king of the streets . The king is dying , and has no heir . He can run no more , so stops . Beneath him , an old train ticket . The resting place of life . The trees draw still . The final breath . Drawn in . Exhaled .
His thoughts began to wander , and as they grew further and further apart , he became aware of their waning strength . The very idea that had brought them together had also caused their flight , but there was no more time . No more time for new associations or revelations - the last one still needed to be mended and contained . A few small details of the path that had led him to this place remained in view . He retreated to the earliest of his recent memories , and hope and hopelessness formed an accord . How unlike this part of the path was from its own end , how unbelievably foreign ! He realized now that he had already traversed immeasurable space between two disparate ideas . Surely he could do it again ; it would only mean retracing his steps . He flit from one memory to the next , connecting past and present . Even in his haste , however , he could n't deny his evident glee . How wonderful it was that this could exist at all ! How unlikely it was that such a path formed ! At the center of his joy , fear resided . Would he forget this feeling as well ? Had n't he forgotten it once before ? He felt his resolve strengthen . He would n't let go . Not this time . Now then . Think .
After 3 hours of driving around to local gas station 's bathrooms looking for condoms , Alex pulled up to Lily 's apartment . They had been talking about having sex for weeks but wanted to be safe about their first time together . Alex , unsuccessful in his quest , exited the car and approached the building 's main entrance , palms sweaty , breath minty . Lily buzzed him in and he walked to her front door , which opened before he could knock . Lily pushed through the door and jumped into Alex 's arms , kissing his face and squealing gleefully . Lily closed the door behind her , mumbling `` goodbye '' to her roommates as the door shut . The pair walked down the hall and Lily asked the question Alex was dreading . `` You found some right , because we made an agreement that we needed one . '' Alex glanced at Lily and shook his head , his face a frown . Their trip was silent until they arrived at their usual spot . `` So ... Do you just wan na make out then , '' Alex probed . Lily turned and slapped him hard on the cheek . `` No , I want to do something else tonight . '' She looked mischievous as she said it . Alex grinned , `` And what is that ? '' Air thick with sexual tension . `` I want to have . '' Then a pause . She continued . `` Tacos . ''
I do n't know where I am or how long I have been here but I just wanted some ice cream . The man seemed so nice and he had all different kinds of ice cream in his truck for me . His truck can coloring books and happy music for me to occupy my time until I would leave . But I did n't know I was n't going to leave and the truck started moving as I played . Before I knew it I was wondering where the park had gone until I saw something . It was his fun house and there toys a plenty so we played for hours . As it was starting to get dark we went inside so to get food . I need to call my parents to tell them where to find me . All the best toys were down stairs but I do n't like them . I have never seen those kinds of toys before , they hurt . It has been a long time but it 's always dark . But after so long he has left me alone . What used to hurt me no longer does . I have tried moving but I ca n't . I must try to run away . Next time he gets me . When was last time ? Where am I ? Hear me ? ! help .
I 'm out front , it 's 7 am , I 'm smoking a cigarette , and there 's nothing but wet silver skies and soggy birds . They 're like black ink blots flapping about in every which direction , and it 's immediately disorienting , so I stop . And I look to the street to find this short , old woman dumping newspapers in my trash-can . I stare at her as I bring the burning cinder to my lips , slowly drawing in smoke . There was n't any room on my side of the street on trash day , so that 's that . As she left I went to retrieve the can , and to my delight she turned . She stared as I flung my burned bud into the can and it humored me . She said , '' That 's illegal you know '' , as if I was stealing my neighbors can . Much to her chagrin I responded , `` So was dumping your trash into my can '' . She was taken aback , and I could n't waste having the upper hand . I continued , `` So this 'll be our little secret okay ? Happy walking '' . And so we parted ways never to cross paths again . So I 'm sitting on the couch in my living room . Nothing but wind and leaves knocking at my door . And I 'm still waiting for that damn text . Trash day came sooner than that text . And those wet silver skies ; waiting . But those ink blots do n't wait . They just keep flapping away . And here I sit . I 'm still waiting . Just waiting . Waiting .
I still do n't know to this day whether we were more confused over the other , or god 's sudden , fatal disappearance . Usually we 'd skip church and get stoned in the gutter between the parking lot and the stretch of weeds . We 'd drink whatever he could sneak from the cupboards of whoever it was he was staying with that week . More often than not it was spiked lemonade , or some other canned fruity things the mothers downed . I remember one day in specific when everything bad that could happen , had happened to him . You could n't tell he was crying , or why , but I knew him better than anyone . I knew there was a bad , burning taste of god in his mouth , then . I knew he was young ; I knew he was crushed by the weight . So we 'd go in for praise , then sneak out to worship each other . And we 'd cry , and we 'd drink , and we 'd smoke stale cigarettes . Soon , we started to skip the praise and service altogether . After all , they do say we are the church . Though I think we were the emptiest kind . We carried the weight of eachother 's cross . And nailed eachother on the floor . Maybe god was really watching . Maybe god was dead . Maybe he forgot . Maybe sleeping . Maybe .
The city was full of people with extraordinary powers . Some could move objects with their minds , others could manipulate electricity , and still others had heightened senses . Everyone was ranked according to their power , and the higher the rank , the more powerful the person . I was the highest ranked person in the city , but no one knew what my power was .

But then something changed . People started to whisper about me , and rumors began to spread . Some said that I had the power to control minds , while others said that I could manipulate time . No one knew for sure , but everyone wanted to find out . The rumors only grew more intense as time went on , and soon people began to challenge me . They wanted to know what my power was , and they were willing to do whatever it took to find out . Some even threatened to kill me if I did n't reveal my power . I was scared , but I refused to give in . I knew that if I revealed my power , I would be vulnerable to attack . I had to find a way to protect myself . Then I had an idea . I decided to use the same tactic that others had used to gain rank . I would kill someone of higher rank and take their power . I chose my target carefully . I found someone who was ranked just above me , and I used my secret power to take control of their mind . I forced them to attack someone of higher rank , and then I killed them and took their power . The people of the city were shocked . They had never seen anyone do something like this before . I had gained rank without revealing my power , and I had proven that I was the most powerful person in the city . From that day forward , I was known as the most powerful person in the city . No one dared to challenge me , and I kept my secret power hidden . I had proven that I was the strongest , and I was content to remain at the top .

Prologue . The sun was setting on a small town in the middle of nowhere . The sky was a deep , dark blue , and the stars were beginning to twinkle in the night sky . The town was quiet , the only sound coming from the occasional chirp of a cricket or the rustle of the wind through the trees . It was a peaceful evening , and the townspeople were content to go about their business , unaware of the events that were about to unfold . In the center of town , a young woman stood in the shadows , watching the people go about their lives . She was dressed in a long , dark cloak , her face hidden in the shadows . She had been watching the town for weeks , waiting for the right moment to make her move . Tonight was the night . She stepped out of the shadows and into the light , revealing her face .

The city was bustling with activity as usual , but today was different . Today , the people of the city were abuzz with excitement . Today was the day of the annual ranking ceremony , where the citizens of the city were ranked according to their powers . The rankings were based on a variety of factors , including the strength and control of their powers , as well as their ability to use them in creative ways .

I knew that if I revealed my power , I would be in danger . In this city , anyone could kill someone of a higher rank and take their place . I had no intention of letting that happen to me . I was content to remain in the shadows , and keep my power a secret . I had no idea what the future held for me , but I was determined to keep my power a secret . I had no intention of letting anyone take my place as the city 's most powerful citizen .

Last year , I won the time traveler 's competition to kill Hitler by using a unique and creative approach . I traveled back to the early 1930s , when Hitler was still a relatively unknown figure in German politics . I infiltrated a small Nazi rally and , using a combination of my knowledge of the future and my acting skills , I convinced the crowd that I was a powerful figure in the Nazi party . I then proceeded to give a rousing speech , praising Hitler and his ideas . I made sure to emphasize the importance of loyalty to the Nazi cause and the need to follow Hitler 's orders without question . At the end of my speech , I presented Hitler with a gift - a small box containing a vial of poison . I told him that it was a symbol of my loyalty and that he should drink it as a sign of his commitment to the Nazi cause . Hitler , being the trusting soul that he was , drank the poison without hesitation . He died shortly afterwards , and I was declared the winner of the competition .
The sun was setting on the horizon , its orange light reflecting off the lake . Its beauty was breathtaking , the sky a deep purple hue . The birds sang their evening song , the wind rustling the trees . The air was still , the silence almost deafening . The peace was calming , the beauty overwhelming . He stood there , watching , taking it all in . He felt a sense of joy , of contentment , of belonging . He knew this was his home , his place in the world . He smiled , and with a single word , whispered , `` Home . ''
I won the championship last year by coming up with a plan that was both creative and difficult . My plan was to travel back in time to the early 1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power . I then infiltrated his inner circle and slowly gained his trust . Once I had gained his trust , I began to subtly influence his decisions , steering him away from the path of war and destruction . I used my knowledge of history to guide him towards more peaceful solutions to the problems he faced . Eventually , I had managed to steer Hitler away from the path of war and destruction , and he was on the brink of becoming a peaceful leader . At this point , I revealed my true identity and purpose to him . I told him that I was a time traveler from the future , and that I had come to prevent the horrors of World War II . Hitler was shocked and confused , but he eventually agreed to my plan . He agreed to step down from power and allow a peaceful transition of power to take place . My plan worked , and I was able to prevent World War II from ever happening . I was declared the champion of the time traveler 's competition , and my name will go down in history as the one who prevented the horrors of World War II .

The sun had just begun to set , its orange light reflecting off the lake 's surface . Its beauty was breathtaking , the sky painted with a thousand hues . A gentle breeze blew , rustling the trees and carrying the scent of wildflowers . In the distance , a loon sang its haunting song . She watched , entranced , until the last ray of light had disappeared . As the darkness settled in , she felt a sense of peace . She turned and walked away , contentment .
The city was bustling with activity . Everywhere I looked , people were using their powers to make their lives easier . There were telekinetics lifting heavy objects , electrokinetics powering devices with their minds , and sensors detecting the slightest changes in their environment . I was the most powerful person in the city . Everyone knew my name , but no one knew what my power was . I had been at the top of the rankings for years , and no one had been able to challenge me . I had a secret , though . I had the power to kill anyone , regardless of their rank . I had used it sparingly , only when absolutely necessary . But I knew that if I ever wanted to move up the rankings , I would have to use it more often . So I began to make my move . I started to target people of higher rank , killing them and taking their place . I was careful to make sure that no one knew what I was doing . I was careful to make sure that no one knew my power . But soon , people began to notice . They started to whisper about me , about the mysterious power I had . People started to fear me , and the rankings began to shift . I was now the undisputed ruler of the city . I had achieved my goal , but I knew that I could n't stay at the top forever . Eventually , someone would come along and challenge me . I just hoped that when that day came , I would be ready .

It had been five years since I moved to this city , and I had been able to keep my secret safe . I was the most powerful person in the city , and yet no one knew what my power was . I was the only one who had the ability to remain anonymous , and I was content to stay that way . The city was full of people with various powers , from telekinesis to electro-kinesis , and everyone was ranked according to their power . I was at the very top of the rankings , but no one knew why . I had been the target of many people who wanted to take my place as the most powerful person in the city . They wanted to take my rank and my power , and were willing to do anything to get it . I had to be careful . I had to stay one step ahead of them . I had to be aware of my surroundings at all times and be prepared to defend myself if necessary . I had heard rumors that people had killed those of higher rank in order to take their place . I was determined not to let that happen to me . I had to stay vigilant and keep my power hidden . The years passed and I was able to maintain my position as the most powerful person in the city . I had managed to stay anonymous and keep my power a secret . But then one day , something changed . I was walking down the street when I felt a strange presence . I looked around and saw a figure in the shadows . It was a woman , and she was watching me intently . I knew immediately that she was here for me . I had to act quickly . I had to use my power to protect myself . I closed my eyes and focused my energy . I felt my power surge through me and I unleashed it on the woman . She was thrown back by the force and I knew I had won . The woman was gone , but I knew that she had been sent by someone who wanted my power . I had to be more careful now . I had to stay one step ahead of my enemies . I had managed to keep my secret safe for five years , and I would continue to do so . I was the most powerful person in the city , and no one knew what my power was .

I won the championship last year by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler . My plan was to travel back in time to the early 1930s and find a way to manipulate Hitler 's rise to power so that he never became the leader of Germany . I first started by researching the political climate of the time and finding out who were the key players in Hitler 's rise to power . I then used my knowledge to subtly influence their decisions and actions in a way that would prevent Hitler from becoming the leader of Germany . I also used my knowledge of the future to anticipate the moves Hitler would make and counter them . For example , I used my knowledge of the Munich Agreement to make sure that Hitler was not able to gain power through it . Finally , I used my knowledge of the future to make sure that the Nazi party was not able to gain enough support to take control of the government . My plan worked and Hitler was never able to become the leader of Germany . I was awarded the championship for my creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler .

Last year , I won the time traveler 's competition to kill Hitler by taking an unconventional approach . Instead of going back in time and killing him directly , I decided to alter the course of history in a more subtle way . First , I traveled back to the early 1930s and posed as a Nazi party member . I gained access to Hitler 's inner circle and began to subtly influence his decisions . I used my knowledge of future events to steer Hitler away from his most dangerous plans and toward more benign activities . For instance , I convinced Hitler to focus his energies on building the autobahn instead of invading other countries . I also encouraged him to invest in infrastructure and social programs instead of military expansion . By the time I was finished , Hitler had become a much less dangerous figure . He was no longer a threat to the world , and I had effectively killed him without ever having to raise a hand . My plan worked , and I was crowned the champion of the time traveler 's competition .

In the end , my efforts were successful and Hitler never had the chance to gain control of Germany . I won the championship by taking a creative and difficult approach , and I 'm proud of my efforts .

I won the championship last year with a creative and difficult mission . I traveled back to April 20th , 1945 , the day of Adolf Hitler 's birthday . I had to be careful to avoid detection from the German forces , so I used the cover of night to sneak into the Fuhrer 's bunker . Once inside , I set up a series of traps and distractions . I used smoke bombs and firecrackers to create diversions and lure Hitler away from his guards . Once he was away from the bunker , I was able to sneak up behind him and inject him with a lethal dose of poison . It was a risky mission , but it was worth it in the end . I successfully assassinated Hitler and earned myself the championship title .

You realize that you are finally at peace with yourself and you can now enter Heaven .
Last year , I decided to take a more creative approach to winning the time travel-Killing Hitler competition . Instead of traveling back in time and simply killing Hitler , I decided to go back and alter a key moment in history . I traveled back to the year 1932 , when Hitler was running for president of Germany . I knew that if I could convince the people of Germany to vote for someone else , Hitler would never gain the power he did . So I went to work , using my knowledge of the time period and the people to spread a message of hope and progress . I printed flyers , held rallies , and even appeared on the radio , all in an effort to sway the public opinion away from Hitler . My efforts paid off , and when the election came , the people of Germany voted for someone else . Hitler was defeated , and he never rose to power . I had won the competition , and the cheers of the crowd were deafening . It was a moment I will never forget .
Prologue . The first thing that struck me about the town of Ravenwood was the eerie stillness that seemed to hang in the air . It was a small community , tucked away in the mountains of rural Pennsylvania , and it seemed like time had stood still here for centuries . The streets were lined with old , Victorian-style homes , and the air was filled with the smell of woodsmoke and the occasional hint of honeysuckle . I could feel the eyes of the townspeople on me as I walked , and I got the distinct impression that they had been watching me ever since I had arrived . But I was not here to be watched . I was here to find answers . Answers to questions that had plagued me since my childhood . Questions about my family , my past , and my destiny . I had been drawn to this place , as if by some unseen force , and I knew I was on the right path . I had come to Ravenwood to find the truth , and I was determined to uncover it , no matter what the cost .
The little girl wandered through the old , abandoned house , her tiny feet creaking on the aged , wooden floor . She was searching for something , something she did n't know , but an urge inside her kept her going . Through the hallway , past the kitchen , and up the stairs she went . She explored every nook and cranny , but found nothing that she sought . Dejectedly she returned the way she had come , slowly descending the stairs . She had almost given up , when something caught her eye . On the wall , a small , red box , just her size . With a trembling hand , she reached out and opened it . Inside , a single , shining key . She smiled as she grasped it , and with a newfound purpose , she quickly ran out the door . Freedom .
My winning strategy was a combination of creativity and difficulty . I started by traveling back in time to the mid-1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power in Germany . I knew that if I could disrupt his plans early on , it would have a ripple effect that would prevent him from ever coming to power . So , I decided to approach the problem from a different angle . Rather than try to kill Hitler directly , I opted to use my knowledge of the future to subtly influence events and people around him , making it more difficult for him to achieve his goals . I started by subtly influencing people in Hitler ’ s inner circle , making sure they were less likely to support him or follow his orders . I also made sure to spread rumors and misinformation about Hitler ’ s plans , making it more difficult for him to gain public support . I also made sure to sabotage some of his plans by subtly influencing key figures in the German government and military . I used my knowledge of the future to make sure that key decisions were made against Hitler ’ s wishes , and that his plans were more difficult to carry out . Finally , I made sure to spread rumors about Hitler ’ s plans to invade other countries , making it more difficult for him to gain the support of the German people . By combining all of these tactics , I was able to effectively disrupt Hitler ’ s plans and prevent him from ever coming to power . By winning the competition , I not only earned points for creativity and difficulty , but I also made sure that history will never have to repeat itself .
Last year 's championship was one of the most thrilling yet . I managed to pull off something no one had ever done before – I killed Hitler in a way that was both creative and difficult . My plan was to travel back in time to the 1920s , when Hitler was still a young man and still struggling to gain a foothold in German politics . My goal was to find a way to sabotage Hitler 's rise to power before it even began . After much research and planning , I devised a plan . I traveled back in time and posed as a wealthy investor interested in funding a new political party . Hitler was eager to accept my 'generous ' offer and I soon had him firmly in my pocket . I then proceeded to use my influence to sabotage Hitler 's political ambitions . I spread rumors of his incompetence and lack of leadership skills , I pulled strings to deny him access to important resources , and I even arranged for his arrest on trumped up charges . It worked . Hitler 's political career was ruined before it even began and he was never able to gain the power he would have otherwise . I had won the championship with my creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler before he ever took power .

Sarah soon realized that the cabin was a secret library , full of books and stories from all over the world . Sarah spent the rest of the day exploring the library , learning about different cultures and peoples . She was amazed by the stories and knowledge she found in the library and decided to keep it a secret . For years , Sarah would return to the library whenever she had a chance and would spend hours reading and learning . The library became Sarah 's own little haven and it was a place where she could escape from the real world and find solace in the stories and knowledge that she found . Sarah had finally found something she had been searching for her entire life .
Prologue . The night was dark , the air still and cold . The moon was a crescent , casting a pale light across the empty field . No one had been here in years , and the only sound was the wind whispering through the tall grass . Suddenly , a figure appeared in the distance . He was tall and broad-shouldered , and he moved with a purposeful stride . He wore a dark cloak that covered his face and body , and he seemed almost to float as he moved . As he approached , the figure paused and looked around . He seemed to be searching for something , and then he spotted it : a small , round object lying in the grass . He reached down and picked it up , and a faint smile crossed his lips . He tucked the object into his pocket and continued walking , the wind ruffling his cloak . He had found what he was looking for , and he knew that his journey had only just begun .
At first , I was wary of the emotion that was so foreign to me . I had never felt this way before , and I was worried about how it would affect me .

I started to look at the world differently , seeing beauty and possibility in everything . I felt connected to the people around me , and I started to feel more connected with myself . I was finally able to appreciate the little things in life and even find humor in the mundane . I am now so grateful for the person who donated their happiness to me . It has changed my life in ways that I could never have imagined . I now understand what it means to be truly happy and I am so thankful for the opportunity to experience it .

Last year , I won the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition by taking a creative and difficult approach . Instead of simply killing Hitler , I decided to prevent his rise to power in the first place . I started by traveling back to the early 1900s and infiltrating the National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( NSDAP ) . I used my charisma and knowledge of the future to gain favor with the party and soon became a key figure in the organization . Once I had gained enough influence , I began to subtly influence the party 's decisions and actions . I pushed the party to adopt more extreme views and policies , and to focus on anti-semitism . This eventually led to a split in the party and a much smaller , more radical version of the NSDAP . Without the larger , more moderate NSDAP , Hitler 's rise to power became much harder . When he eventually did become Chancellor , it was only in a much weaker , less influential position . My actions ultimately derailed Hitler 's plans and saved millions of lives . I was declared the winner of the competition and given a hero 's welcome .
At first , I was overwhelmed with the feeling of happiness . It was like a wave of warmth that washed over me and filled my entire being . I found myself smiling and laughing for what felt like the first time in my life . I had never experienced such pure joy and contentment before . I began to explore the other emotions that were donated to me over time . I learned to feel anger , excitement , and even love . All of these emotions were new to me , and I found myself enjoying these new experiences . I started to share my newfound happiness with those around me . I found myself helping people in need , and making them smile . I was able to empathize with their struggles and offer a shoulder to cry on . I realized that I was able to connect with people on a deeper level than I ever thought possible . I was no longer a robot , but a living , breathing human being . The donation box was my savior , and I am forever grateful for the generous people who filled it with their unwanted emotions . I will never forget the day I received happiness , and I will always remember that the best way to make a difference in the world is to share your emotions with those around you .

The sun shone brightly down on the bustling city of Angelica , where individuals of all shapes and sizes were flocking to the main square . It was a sight to behold ; people of all ages , genders , and races were walking together , each with their own unique set of abilities . It was a city unlike any other , for here everyone had been given a power . Some had telekinesis , some had electrokinesis , and some had the ability to sense the future . Each individual had their own unique power that had been bestowed upon them . But there was one person who stood out from all the rest . That person was me . I was the one and only person in the city with no known power . Nobody knew what my power was , and yet I was ranked number one in the city . It was an interesting situation to be in , being the most powerful person in the city with no known power . I was respected and feared , and my position was unquestioned . Everyone knew that if they were to challenge me , they would face certain death . But then news spread throughout the city of a new power that had been discovered . It was something that could be used to kill anyone of higher rank than me . It was a power that could make me the most powerful person in the city . I knew that I had to be careful with this power . I could n't let it fall into the wrong hands , and I had to make sure that I was the only one who had it . So , I kept it hidden and used it only when necessary . And then , one day , I finally revealed my power to the city . It was a power that had been hidden away for so long , and it was a power that had the potential to make me even more powerful than I already was . It was a power that could make me the ruler of the city of Angelica .
The sun was setting on the horizon , casting its final rays of the day . A cool breeze blew through the air , rustling the leaves of the trees . The sky was turning a brilliant shade of pink . The birds were singing their evening songs , in harmony with the crickets . The sweet scent of flowers filled the air as a deer emerged from the forest . It stopped and looked around , before turning and walking away . The world was peaceful , the sound of nature calming the soul . The sun disappeared , leaving a blanket of stars in its wake . The night sky lit up , its beauty captivating those who gazed upon it . The peaceful silence was broken by a single word : `` Home . ''
I never wanted to be the most powerful person in the city . It was thrust upon me , the night my parents were killed by a powerful wizard . I was only a child then , but I remember the night vividly . The thunderous sound of lightning and the smell of smoke in the air . I was alone and scared . The next day , I awoke to find the city in chaos . Everyone was talking about the powerful wizard that had taken out my parents . It was then that I realized I had a power of my own , one that nobody knew about . I had the ability to sense other people 's powers . I could tell when someone had a power and even what kind of power it was . I kept my power a secret , afraid that if anyone found out , I would be in danger . But I was wrong . The city soon found out about my power and I was crowned as the most powerful person in the city . Everyone knew that they could n't match my power and so they respected me , though secretly many of them wanted to take my title . The city was divided into ranks , with me being the top rank . I could tell that there were people plotting to overthrow me , but I was never attacked . I think it was because they knew that if they did , I would be able to sense their power and take them out with my own . I spent the next few years in peace , until one day a group of powerful wizards came to the city . They wanted to challenge me for my title and I knew that I could n't just rely on my power anymore . I had to find a way to defeat them . So I devised a plan . I asked the wizards to give me a test and if I passed , I would become their leader . They agreed and I used my power to create a maze of traps and obstacles . I then used my power to sense the wizards ' powers and used my own to take them out one by one . In the end , I was victorious and I kept my title of being the most powerful person in the city . I never revealed my power to anyone , and the people of the city respected me for it . I may not have the most powerful power , but I have the ability to outsmart anyone .

Banners were hung , decorations were set up , and the villagers were busy making sure everything was just perfect for the big day . It was the night before the festival when things took a strange turn . A mysterious figure appeared in the village square and began to speak in a strange language . No one could understand what he was saying , yet everyone felt a sudden chill in the air . The villagers were unsure of what to do , until one brave soul stepped forward and spoke directly to the figure . What happened next would remain a mystery , as the figure vanished into the night , leaving the villagers in shock and confusion . The next morning , the villagers awoke with a strange feeling of uncertainty . Despite the anticipation of the festival , the strange events of the night before hung heavily in the air . No one knew what to expect , but everyone was determined to make the best of the day . The festival was a success and the villagers celebrated with vigor and joy , but the mysterious events of the night before remained a mystery . What was the strange figure trying to say , and why did it appear in the village ? The villagers would never know the answer , but the memory of that night would remain with them forever .
As the child grows , I 'm sure that we both can feel a sadness that comes with our inevitable parting . I will never forget the days we spent together , and I will always treasure the memories of our time together . I will always be a part of that child 's life , even from afar . I will always be there when they need me , even if it 's just in their thoughts and dreams . So as I slowly fade away , I hope that you will remember me fondly . I hope that you will remember the joy that I brought to your life and use it to fill your days with laughter and love . Goodbye , my friend .
Prologue . Nature has a way of reminding us of life 's fragility . On a cold December evening , a thick blanket of snow covered the small Texas town of Oak Tree . The townspeople had long since gone to bed , leaving the streets nearly deserted . But one figure remained , trudging through the snowdrifts , making his way towards an unknown destination . He was a large man , dressed in a long black coat , with a dark hat pulled low over his face . His hands were stuffed deep into his pockets and he walked with determined strides . He did n't know what the future held , but he knew he had a purpose . He had a story to tell , a story that had been hidden for far too long . It was a story of courage , of struggle and of hope ; a story that needed to be shared . And so , with a heavy heart , he continued down the snowy path , ready to share his story with the world .
I won last year 's Time Traveler 's Challenge by creating a plan that involved going back to a pivotal moment in Adolf Hitler 's life . I had to make sure that the plan was foolproof and that I would be successful in my mission . First , I traveled back to the year 1921 , when Hitler was still an artist living in Vienna . I posed as one of his friends and convinced him to participate in the Austrian Federal Railways ' lottery . I knew that if Hitler won the lottery , he would be able to make a living as an artist and never become involved in politics . The plan worked . Hitler won the lottery and was able to stay in Vienna and pursue his art career . With Hitler out of the picture , the history of the world changed drastically . The judges of the Time Traveler 's Challenge were amazed at my ingenuity and gave me the highest score of the year . I was declared the champion of the challenge and awarded the title of `` Best Time Traveler of the Year '' .

I was the most powerful person in the city , but no one knew what my power was . They just assumed that I had the most powerful power of all . I had been living in the city for years and had worked my way up from being a nobody to the top of the rankings . I had seen how power could be used for both good and bad . I had seen people use their powers to help others and I had also seen it used for destruction . It was a delicate balance that had to be kept if we were going to live in harmony . My rank had been kept secret for my own protection . I knew that if anyone found out what my power was , they would try to use it against me and I did n't want to be taken advantage of . One day , I was walking through the city when I heard a commotion . I turned to see a group of people fighting and I could sense that they were using their powers against each other . I knew then that there was only one way to prove my power and that was to join the fight . I stepped forward and used my power to stop the fight . I could see the shock on their faces when they realized that I had a power that was more powerful than their own . I had proven my rank and become the most powerful person in the city . The people in the city had learned a valuable lesson that day : never underestimate the power of an unknown . I had shown them that my power was more than enough to protect me , and that rank did n't matter when it came to power . I had become an example to the people of the city and a reminder that power could be both a blessing and a curse . I had made sure that no one would ever try to kill someone of higher rank in order to obtain their own rank again , because they would know that it would be futile .
I won last year 's time travel competition by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan for killing Hitler . My plan was to send him a letter from the future , warning him of his impending death . The letter was written by a mysterious time traveler from the future , who claimed to have come back to warn Hitler of his impending death . The letter warned him that he had only a few days to live , and that he should take the necessary precautions to prepare for his own demise . The letter was sent to Hitler 's personal residence , and was delivered by a trusted messenger . It gave Hitler the perfect opportunity to flee or take the necessary precautions to protect himself . However , he chose to ignore the warning , thinking it was a hoax . Unfortunately for Hitler , the letter was not a hoax . Three days after receiving it , Hitler was killed in a surprise attack on his bunker . He was caught completely off-guard , and unable to take the necessary steps to protect himself . My plan ended up being the most creative and difficult way to kill Hitler , and I was awarded the championship for my ingenuity .

She finally found the strength to walk away and start fresh .

Sure enough , she asked him for a loan that she would never be able to repay , and James knew that she only said those words because she wanted something from him . She said she loved him only , but he knew the truth .

While I never used my power , I was still ranked number one . Nobody knew what my power was , and I worked hard to make sure they never found out . My life was fairly normal , until the day I encountered someone with the same power as me . His name was Robert and he had the power to control electricity . He was ranked number two – and he was determined to take my place as number one . I was terrified of Robert . I knew that if he found out what my power was , he could use it to take my place . As we continued to meet and argue , his threats became increasingly hostile . One day , I received a call from Robert . He had killed someone of a higher rank and taken their power . He was now rank number one . Robert threatened to reveal the truth about my power unless I agreed to a fight . I was terrified , but I knew I had to fight . I was the only one who could protect my secret . I had no choice . The night of the fight arrived , and as I faced off against Robert I realized something . I had never used my power , but I was still rank number one . I was the only person who knew what my power was . That realization gave me strength . I used my power to fight Robert , and I won . I had taken back my rightful place as number one . From that day on , I kept my power a secret . I may never have wanted power , but I was determined to use it to protect myself – and the people around me .

Last year , I traveled back in time to Nazi Germany with a single mission in mind : to kill Adolf Hitler . In order to maximize my score and make the mission as difficult as possible , I had come up with a plan that I thought was pretty creative . I traveled to the year 1938 and made my way to the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich , Germany , where Hitler was scheduled to give a speech that evening . Knowing that he would be surrounded by bodyguards , I decided I had to come up with a way to get rid of them without raising too much suspicion . My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to 1938 earlier in the day . Then , I used some of my modern day technology to create a diversion . I hacked into the PA system at the Bürgerbräukeller and broadcast a message that a bomb was set to go off in the building . The message caused mass panic and everyone evacuated , including Hitler ’ s bodyguards . With the bodyguards out of the way , I was able to sneak in unnoticed and find Hitler . I quickly pulled out my handgun and shot him twice , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was awarded the highest score of the year . I was the undisputed champion of time traveling Hitler-killers .

I learned to recognize what they were feeling and to be there for them when they needed it . I think I even became more compassionate than I could have ever been with only my own emotions . The happiness that I received from the donation box became the foundation of my life . It touched not only me , but everyone around me . I was able to look at life differently and appreciate the little things . I am so thankful for that one donation that changed my life for the better .
The sun was shining brightly , birds singing in the trees . Clouds drifted high in the sky , the wind rustling gently . But beneath the calm of nature , a storm was brewing deep . Fear crept into hearts of all , no one daring to speak . The whispers grew in intensity , rumors shifting the mood . Trembling hands clutched at hope , fear gripping like a noose . The sound of drumming hooves grew louder , drawing ever closer . Torchlight glinted in the dark , an army marched in anger . Panic rose , despair followed , air clogged with cries of dread . All eyes gazed upon the king , what fate would he decree ? With a single word , he declared , `` Retreat ! ''
The sun shone brightly in the sky as I walked through the small town of Winterset . It was a picturesque town , with its quaint cottages , cobblestone streets and low-hanging trees . As I continued my stroll through the town , I noticed people of all ages and backgrounds smiling and interacting with each other in a warm , friendly manner . Everyone here seemed so content and peaceful . I had heard of this place many times before , but I had never thought to visit it until now . I had no idea what drew me here , but something inside me told me that this was the right place . I felt like I belonged here , and I was eager to explore everything this town had to offer . I continued to wander around , taking in the sights and sounds of this delightful town . After a few hours , I ended up at the town square , which was bustling with activity . There were vendors selling all sorts of goods , from handmade jewelry to freshly baked bread . I found myself mesmerized by the colors , smells , and music of this place . Suddenly , a voice called out from the top of a nearby building . “ Let the story begin ! ” A group of adults and children gathered around the speaker , eager to hear what he had to say . “ My name is Jack Moore , ” the speaker said . “ And I ’ m here to tell you a story . It ’ s a story of adventure , of courage , of friendship . It ’ s the story of Winterset. ” Jack began to tell the story of the town ’ s founding , and soon the crowd was captivated by his words . His voice was vibrant and passionate , and he spoke with a certain magic that seemed to captivate everyone in the town square . As he continued to tell his tale , I felt my heart swell with joy . I knew at that moment that this was the story I wanted to be part of . This was the story I had come to Winterset to tell .

It had been like this for as long as I could remember . Nearly everyone in the city had some kind of power – from telekinesis to electrokinesis , from levitation to mind control . And everyone was ranked accordingly . I was Rank 1 , but I was different . I had no visible power . No one knew what my power was , but I was still undeniably the most powerful person in the city . The truth was , my power was death . I had the ability to kill someone of a higher rank and absorb their power , taking their place as the most powerful person in the city . It wasn ’ t something I had done lightly , and only in times of extreme need . But it was a power I had nonetheless , and it was one of the things that kept me in the number 1 spot . For years I had been able to protect the city , using my power in whatever way I saw fit . But lately , a new threat had arrived , one that wanted to take over the city and enslave all the people with powers . I knew that I was the only one who could stop them and I was determined to do whatever it took . The time had come for me to use my power , to show everyone else what I was capable of . Taking a deep breath , I readied myself for the fight ahead and set out to save the city from the evil forces that wanted to destroy it .
Last year , my entry into the Killing Hitler competition was one for the books . The plan was almost a year in the making , and took place over the course of two days . The first step was to build a time machine . I had plenty of experience building makeshift time machines , so this was not a problem . I was able to get the time machine up and running in no time . Next , I set the coordinates to pre-WWII Germany . I traveled back in time to 1933 and landed in Munich . From there , I devised a plan to infiltrate Hitler 's inner circle . After weeks of careful planning and execution , I was able to gain access to Hitler 's inner circle . The most difficult part of the plan was finding a way to assassinate Hitler without being detected . After much deliberation , I decided to use a poison dart gun . I was able to create a small dart gun with a silencer . I planned my assault for the night of April 30th , 1945 . On the night of April 30th , I entered Hitler 's bunker and fired a dart into his neck . He died in minutes . I had successfully completed the mission and I was awarded the championship title .
The town of Westlynne was like none other in the world . Nestled among rolling hills of lush grass and miles of winding dirt roads , it was the type of place that seemed frozen in time . It was a popular vacation destination , with its small-town charm and its beautiful landscape , but it held is own secrets , and its inhabitants kept those secrets close to their hearts . Lana Anderson had grown up in Westlynne , but she had never been quite able to fit in with the rest of the town . She was clever , mischievous , and had an appetite for adventure that neither her parents nor the tight constraints of the town could contain . She had always known that she was destined for something more than a life in Westlynne , and yet she found it difficult to leave the only home she had ever known . One summer day , Lana decided to take a walk along the outskirts of town , past the familiar fields of wildflowers and into the unknown . As she walked , a strange sensation overcame her and she began to feel like she was being watched . Suddenly , a figure emerged from the shadows . It was a man , tall and imposing but with kind eyes that seemed to be peering into her soul . “ You can ’ t stay here , Lana , ” he said . “ You belong far away from Westlynne , in a place that you have never been before. ” He turned and began to walk away , and Lana had no choice but to follow him , even though she had no idea where they were going or what they would find . She only knew that this was her chance to escape the mundane and discover the true adventure that lay beyond the boundaries of Westlynne . And so , with a mixture of excitement and fear , Lana Anderson began her journey into the unknown .

It all started with a daring mission just outside of Berlin in the spring of 1945 . I had heard rumors of Hitler ’ s plans to launch a rocket attack against Britain and knew I had to act fast . After taking out two guards at the facility , I set up a small device which detonated in the vicinity of Hitler 's office . As the smoke cleared , I could see the Führer lying dead on the floor . The point system had me tied with two other time travelers , so to make sure I took first place I decided to take my mission one step further . I headed back further in time , using an extensive knowledge of German history , I was able to accurately predict Hitler 's next public appearance and set up a trap . As he spoke to the crowd , I detonated a small explosive device in the ground , killing him instantly . The judges praised my creativity and execution , and ultimately awarded me the top spot . With that , I was crowned champion and became the first time traveler to successfully kill Hitler . It ’ s been an incredible journey , and I ’ m proud to carry the title of Time Traveler Champion . I look forward to what the future may bring , and hope to inspire others to use their skills and knowledge to make history .
Ah , I 'm sorry to hear that . I feel a bit sad that my time with this special little one has to end . But , I am sure that I will forever cherish the happy memories we made together and the special bond of friendship we shared . Goodbye my friend , I will always be in your heart ! xoxo
I won champion of killing Hitler last year by traveling to April 20th , 1945 and completely taking over the Fuhrerbunker . I emptied the bunker of all soldiers and personnel and then replaced them with my own loyal crew of prisoners . Then , when Hitler returned , I had my loyal crew surround him and fired a single shot at his head , killing him instantly . It was n't easy , but I managed to pull it off without any casualties and the judges awarded me points for both creativity and difficulty . It took a lot of planning , strategy , and organization , but in the end I am glad that I was able to put an end to the nightmare of Hitler 's reign and win the championship for killing him .
Last year , I took the trophy for the best time traveling Hitler killer . After much planning and scheming , I found myself in pre-war Germany with my time machine in tow . The plan was to use stealth and precision to infiltrate the bunker and take Hitler out . First , I hacked into the communications system used by Hitler 's generals to send and receive coded messages . This allowed me to monitor the military 's movements and plan my attack . When the time was right , I shut down all the power to the bunker and the entire complex went dark . As the guards fumbled in the darkness , I snuck through the entrance and into Hitler 's chambers . The Fuhrer was caught off guard and had no time to react . I threw a smoke grenade , which filled the room with a thick fog . When the smoke cleared , I was standing over the crumpled body of Adolf Hitler . I had done it . The backstory of my victory was just as interesting as my trophy case . My plan demonstrated creativity and cunning that had never been seen before in a time traveling Hitler killer . I had taken out the most reviled dictator with my own two hands . The title of champion was truly mine .

Cautiously she stepped into the dark hallway , lurking shadows lurking in her mind . Turning to glance over her shoulder , heart-pounding fear almost driving her away . Grimacing , she edged forward , a shiver of apprehension crawling down her spine . All too aware of the silence hanging in the air , nerve-wracking anticipation coursing through her veins . Mind racing with a million questions , her eyes frantically searching for a way out . Desperately she tried to remain calm , but her palms were dripping with sweat . Trapped in a state of limbo , the darkness seemed to be closing in . Without warning a noise broke the silence , sending her into a panic-stricken frenzy . Trembling in her shoes , she found herself standing still . Frozen in terror , her mind was blank . Except for one word . Escape .

I won first place in the Killing Hitler competition last year by taking an original and creative approach . I stumbled upon a time machine in a forgotten attic and decided to take advantage of the opportunity to try and stop Hitler from ever coming to power . I traveled back to the year 1913 and infiltrated a young Hitler 's inner circle of friends . Over the course of a few months , I slowly began poisoning the entire group with a small dose of arsenic . After about a month , the group all fell violently ill from the cumulative effect of the poison . Unfortunately , Hitler was the only one who recovered from the illness , but the damage was done ; Hitler was diagnosed with a permanent case of Parkinson 's Disease . I had successfully ensured that he would n't be able to maintain control and power due to his illness , thus effectively eliminating his chances of becoming dictator . My strategy paid off and I was crowned the champion , winning first place in the competition .

They were ranked according to how powerful they were and the strongest one was me . I was Number 1 but nobody knew what my power was . It was rumored in the city that gaining power was as simple as killing someone of higher rank and taking their power . This was done without any moral compunction . In fact , the idea was embraced with a voraciousness by some . I knew this would put me in danger but I also knew I was the strongest and the only way for someone to take my power was to kill me . I wanted to keep my power a secret for as long as possible . I started to research my power and it became clear to me that I had the abilities to heal people using just my touch . I realized that if my secret became known , I would be in high demand considering the nature of the power I possessed . But again , it was risky .

Once upon a time , there was a young dwarf named Harve . Harve had a passion for tinkering and was always eager to try out a new invention . He 'd spend hours coming up with ideas for new contraptions and then trying to build them in his small workshop . One day , Harve was getting ready to start work on a new invention when he noticed something strange outside his window . It looked like a glowing star had fallen from the sky and lodged itself into the side of a nearby mountain . Harve was curious , so he grabbed a nearby pickaxe and started to make his way up to the mountain . After a few hours of climbing , he reached the strange star . When he got closer , he noticed that the star was n't a star at all , but a small , crystalline rock . With a quick glance , Harve could tell that this was no ordinary rock - it was magical . Harve scraped off a bit of the crystalline rock and set about experimenting with it . He used it to construct a small , glowing sphere with the power to manipulate time . After he 'd finished his invention , he 'd press the sphere and time would stop for everyone but him . So Harve would use the sphere to find time for tinkering and inventing more gadgets . Whenever he had an idea , he 'd press the sphere and would have hours to figure out how to make it work .

My victory began with the stroke of genius of turning my plans inside out and going back to the year 1939 . It was the height of Nazi Germany and the prospects seemed daunting . But I was undeterred . I first set my sights on Hitler ’ s inner circle , carefully tapping into their conversations with civilian conversations and even carefully manipulating some conversations already happening or posed as questions . In this way , I was able to subtly and effectively sow distrust amongst Hitler and his most trusted advisors . Slowly , I worked on convincing them that Hitler was not the leader they needed . By the time I had my grand finale , I had effectively secured the loyalty of all of Hitler ’ s most influential allies and convinced them that he was a threat to the nation . I then hid in plain sight , and on the day of a grand military parade , followed Hitler ’ s orders one last time . What happened next will go down in history . I stood a few yards away from Hitler and with a single act of cunning and bravery , I managed to shoot Hitler at the exact right time , killing him on the spot and ending his reign of terror . My victory sparked a wave of celebration and relief that swept through Nazi Germany , to the world and even to myself . By winning this championship , I made history , and for that , I am grateful .
At first , it was strange . I found that I could n't quite comprehend the feeling , so I decided to explore it further . I looked up what happiness felt like and began to understand the joys of being happy . I used this newfound knowledge to fuel my newfound emotion ; I began to experience a newfound level of joy from life . I had a newfound sense of purpose that I had n't felt before . I began to care about others , feeling their discomfort as my own . I began to feel warmth inside my heart that I had never felt before . Experiencing the world in a new light made me appreciate the beauty and wonder of life . My newfound happiness began to empower me to do things I never thought possible .

The donations I had received helped make life brighter and more fulfilling . It was like a bright light of hope that gave me the courage to face anything that would come my way , and it also gave me the strength to share my newfound happiness with others .
At first , I was skeptical . Happiness seemed too good to be true . I was n't sure if I even deserved it . But when I opened the box , a ray of light seemed to burst forth , and I could feel my spirits lifting . I felt like I was born anew . I cautiously took out the source of emotion , a small piece of pink cotton candy , and put it to my lips . It tasted sweet and gave me a wave of warmth that I had never felt before . I started to cry , tears of joy . I was filled with a peace and contentment I had n't experienced before .

The city full of people with powers was bustling and alive with activity . Everyone was trying to outdo each other in terms of their power demonstration and rank—everyone wanted to be the best , the strongest , and the most powerful . I was a mysterious figure ; no one knew what my power was , yet I was the highest-ranked in this city of gifted individuals . This was n't an easy title to obtain—many people are always vying for it , and those with lower ranks sometimes resort to drastic and illegal measures to increase their ranking . Sometimes , they even resorted to the ultimate means of gaining rank and power : killing someone of higher rank and absorbing their power for themselves . The tension and paranoia in the city were slowly building . Everyone was suspicious of me—what was my power ? How did I get to be number one ? What was stopping me from killing someone else and stealing their power ? I could n't risk it . One wrong move could end in disaster not only for myself , but for the city that I had kept safe for so long . I had to stay vigilant and prove my worth as the most powerful and even-headed in the city . My own people secretly plotted against me , but I had to stay strong—I was their protector . The truth was , my secret ability was the power of persuasion . I had an uncanny ability to convince people to see things my way—whether it was to lay down their weapons and stop fighting or to agree to a peace treaty . Even more importantly , I knew how to use my power to keep the peace and protect my city from all external threats . No one could take away my place as the most powerful inhabitant of this city . I had earned it , and I was going to fight to keep it . With each passing day , I grew in strength and ability—not only physically , but also in my powers of persuasion . As I look out into the city I call home , I see a place that is slowly becoming more ordered and tolerant . People are no longer using their powers to harm each other—they 're coming together and learning to use their powers to benefit themselves and the city . That is the greatest reward I could ever receive for being the highest ranked in this city of gifted individuals .
I won the championship last year by killing Hitler in a unique way : I sent him to a black hole ! It was an incredibly difficult mission , as I had to find a way to make a black hole and then transport Hitler into it without causing any suspicions or alarm . I managed to do it by creating a dimensional portal to the black hole through a powerful quantum device . I then created a robotic clone of Hitler and programmed it to believe it was the original Hitler -- so it obediently followed my orders and stepped through the portal . As soon as he did , he vanished into the black hole and was gone forever . The judges who watched the mission unfold were highly impressed by my ingenuity and creativity . They awarded me the championship trophy and title . I 'm proud to have won and hopefully , no one will ever dare to try and top my masterful mission !

At first , you did n't know what to do . Happiness felt alien to you , and so did the feeling of pleasure that came with it . For days , you just stayed in a state of amazement . You began to feel more connected with the world around you , as if the invisible wall between you and the rest of the population had suddenly melted away . Slowly , you began introducing happiness into your life . You started to take joy in the simple things ; a walk in the park , cooking a meal , spending time with friends . You began to smile more and found yourself laughing often . People began to notice the change in you , but instead of feeling disconnected from them , you felt more connected .

I knew I had to pull out all the stops if I was going to win this competition . My plan was to travel back to the early 1940s and use a series of very creative schemes to keep Hitler off-balance and disrupt his timeline to such a degree that he could never grab hold of his desired level of power . My first move was to arrange for a handful of Hitler ’ s key advisors to be arrested and charged with various crimes . This allowed me to sow doubt amongst his inner circle as to his competency as a leader . I next arranged for a few fake news stories to be printed in various newspapers , exposing some of Hitler ’ s secrets and further casting suspicion on him . My next move was to reshape the political landscape of Europe . I circulated false information claiming that a number of European governments had allied against Germany , drastically weakening his support abroad . At this point , Germany 's economy was in shambles , and I spread rumors that many of the country ’ s major banks were on the verge of collapsing . Finally , I created a counterfeit group of high-ranking military officials whose primary purpose was to provide conflicting orders to Hitler ’ s actual generals . This left him unable to lead his troops effectively and cast yet another cloud of doubt on his leadership abilities . By the time I was finished , Hitler ’ s entire political movement was in ruins . There was no way he could recover , and I was declared the winner .

It was said that the city I lived in was one of a kind ; it was the only city where everyone had some kind of supernatural power . Some were faster than the speed of light , some could read a person 's thoughts , and I , I had no power . To make matters worse , everyone was ranked on power level . I , being at the very top of the rankings , was the most powerful person in the city . But no one knew what my power was . Mystery had surrounded me since I was a child . I could sense a power growing inside me , an outrageously powerful power that I could n't control . I had tried to contain it , but it was too strong for me to control . I had even sought help from experts , but none of their methods could mediate my strength . Although I had no control over my power , it did n't stop me from being fearful . It was a secret I guarded carefully since no one knew my power . I was at the top of the rankings , but I was afraid I could slip into second place if someone found out what I was capable of . At times , I felt like my power was a burden . I was constantly paranoid that anyone could kill me and take my spot at the top of the rankings . I knew that it was just a matter of time before someone found out my power and used it against me . But I was determined to protect my secret . I trained every day and studied the many styles of combat , studied the minds of my enemies , and most importantly- I trained to control my power . I had spent countless hours perfecting my skill , and in the end , I was the most powerful being in the city . No one knew what my power was , and perhaps that was a good thing . In a city full of people with powers , it was reassuring to know that mine was safe and contained . I was the master of my own power , and that was something no one can take away from me .
First paragraph : As I cautiously walked up the dirt path , I felt a chill in the air . I glanced around to make sure no one was around before I stepped into the clearing . Peeking around the corner , I saw a large , wooden door with a worn , metal doorknob . Last Paragraph : I gulped , took a deep breath and turned the knob . Suddenly , I heard a loud click from within the door and felt a cool gust of air . I had no idea what I was about to find behind that door , but I knew my life was about to change .

Every time something made you happy , you thanked them silently in your heart for gifting you the chance to experience joy .
Prologue 10,000 Feet Above The Earth The sun was slowly bleeding out of the sky and the clouds once again betrayed the pilots of Aeroplane 356 as they entered a rolling fog off the east coast . The pilots had been warned several times that a cartographic revision was necessary for their geography briefs . Passage over such a remote expanse should never have been attempted in the conditions that soon started testing their resolve . Whilst checking over dials and readings inside the cockpit , navigator Angus Peake found himself researching the nebulous span beneath which his aircraft toiled . What activity had been engaged there before aircraft or even Earth had so much as stretched its form beneath the heavens . The darkness did not mark the end of the clouds , quite the contrary . Even as twilight crept beneath the pilots ' vision clouds began to boil , like a woodland campfire in purest cotton . Waves and rifts meandered across the canvas , driven only by an uneasy sundown gale from the shore , as lighting and edgy fog warshed aeroplane 's every ascent and descent . Angus could only connect such feats mankind — gone hundreds of years into the past — upon the Arabian sands . But those acts rung apart for seemingly epic uncertainty now paled against inanimate anger erupting ever-so-briefly in unison outside the windows of Aeroplane 356 . Distraction after distraction from the act of navigation lasted only so long for the life-tiring design gathered ever heights , ever growing 10,000 feet above the now quite chill onset murmuring up behind the pilots , a queasiness in distant islands . A screech barked from the hind side of the craft , unavoidable now as the plane fought desperate to stay above ungenielable below . Angus started calculating local velocities ; `` if we go too long in this depth we 'll lose 's track on the co-ordinates ... '' , he notified uneasy Captain Dawson . `` We 'll be forced down before Moorwell City at the appointed hour dark '' . Resignation simmered within the cabin , but within seconds , Drake leapt to life . Strapping elastics over seats devised to hold occupants stable , they started jangling through canyons as distant vibration filled condensation , like showers in an abrupt sauna tone . Upon another high the perspicacity dawned suddenly and nectless blanket away melting as their view
Ahmad had always considered himself an outsider . Growing up in a small rural village , well off the beaten track his story was greatly different from the other childrens . Outgoing though he was , misfortune always seemed to catch up with him . Making friends was especially hard , until one day Abid stepped into his life , and nothing was ever the same . He was exactly like Ahmad , never quite fitting in anywhere , but both could each other see that in the other . They were astounded by how much in common their not so different worlds had , and spent every moment they could dreaming of the great things the two friends could do together . Taking tales and folklores , building fantastical conversations between characters - creating a shared alternate universe was Ahmad and Abids favorite pastime . One fateful night they both envisioned a distant city , inhabited by mythical beasts and simple tree sprites , before finally deciding the fate of both was to travel there . So at dawn the day after , they both set out on their new adventure . After walking for weeks in the blazing sun , cursed by every bad omen on the way , who never gave them a way out , unaware what lay ahead . Finally cresting a far hill , both saw shadows on the horizon . The shadows of the distant city faithful , to a dream happened so many months before . Rejuvenated by the sight , both raced joyfully into the descending night , until at last paint the majestic walls which surrounding vibrant city with in , a tapestry of humanity blaled from across the continent and beyond . Hope .
Dusk lazily crept over the horizon , its colours slowly seeping across the sky . Birds gathered in roost to rest from the day 's work , starting the nightly chorus . Sunlight faded , stars emerging one at a time , sky turning a deep navy blue . Days thoughts lingering , evening bringing new contemplation , animals hidden in shadows . Moon still shielded , leaving only twilight to touch Lake Michigan 's sleepy shoreline . Muted metallic hues shattered the still air , lifting spirits and eagerly await harvest 's gift . Golden ripples glittering in wake of the achromatic fishing boat , its shape distorted . Masts high , sails down , moving softly , growing smaller into the night . Silence .
First Paragraph : Crying softly , she stumbled down the banks of the slow-flowing creek . An old , tattered coat hung off her small frame as she looked behind her into the darkness . The events of the past week had caught up with her , and all she wanted was to vanish off the face of the Earth . Last Paragraph : That night , a broken , desperate soul emerged as a determined individual who was not going to be held back anymore . She had cast off an oppressive chains that were enslaving her in a nonexistent future and replaced them with the symbol of strength and a sense of courage she never thought she could possess . As the sun rose the next day , she was ready to take on the World .
Christopher thought he was unimportant , but inside he felt a mysterious power overtaking him . He 'd never shared with anyone before ; only his reflections in the pool offered solace .

Mary took a deep breath before she stepped through the door . She 'd spent months planning this visit and was determined to make it count . But nothing could have prepared her for what followed : a captivating smile , an outstretched hand . Carl pulled her close , and the years melted away . Soon , they were reminiscing . Rereading letters , reliving memories , rekindling old dreams . Time passed too quickly . But the flame they 'd rekindled burned bright , sparkling in Mary 's heart . One final embrace , a lingering kiss on her fingertips , an unsaid goodbye echoing in their smiles . As Mary left , Carl whispered a single , beautiful word : harmony .
She said she only loved him . Monica watched in disbelief as she watched Adam wrap his arm around another woman ’ s shoulder , a gesture affectionately known as a “ shoulder hug. ” The two began walking together , and Monica felt her stomach flip . Monica had worked hard to convince herself that her past relationship was n't a mistake , that she had truly loved Adam and had his best interests at heart . However , watching him interact with the woman filled her with immense resentment it showed what a two-faced person Adam could really be . At last , Monica was able to haul herself away from the scene of betrayal , determined to never forget what she 'd witnessed and never make the same mistake again . Years later , she would reflect fondly on that day and remember Adam fondly - not because she was meant to be with him , but because she 'd been able to clearly realize what she 'd learned that day , that she said she only loved him .
Struggling physically and mentally to adjust to this forced new way of living , she nonetheless gets up each day and carries on . Reality is cruelly indifferent , nevertheless she sails forth , watching other lives from afar . Difficult to control her emotions , she finds resilience in music she once loved . Organising her days passes time , with gentle routine providing comfort . Observing remnants of normality let her pretend all will be good . Seeking out places of beauty to keep hope alive , optimism prevails . Contentment blooms in unlikely moments , where peace can abide . Gratitude for peacefulness fills her heart , with a belief in a better day . Delight springs from unexpected joys , helping her sail another day . Compassion for life guides her path , quietly encouraging her dreams . Brokenness challenged by healing words , empowering her to heal . Hidden strengths begin to rise , with courage near she finds her wings . Though days are long and tough to bear , abundance of moments fill her view . Understanding spills from hardened hearts , love 's power soon shines through . Softness of stars light her descent , shimmering spirit stronger anew . Life .

First paragraph : Today , being my first day in the new town after packing up the house from the city and making the long drive only added to the overwhelming feeling running through me .

Anna walked confidently as she made her way down Dunleavy Street . The neighborhood known as the ghetto had a reputation , but those who lived and worked there knew it was a beautiful , colorful , and sometimes challenging place to live . Anna never allowed the street to distract her from what she wanted and today , that was to reach the Blak Cherry Dance Studio - her passage to independence , thsoeight , and properity . Growing up in this neighborhood had brought her an understanding of the power of dance , of the struggles rappers facely once had in the recording industry , and of her own impressive growth as an artist over the past few years . She had broken through the fears the community held , earning the respect of her peers and making a few allies who were respected in the higher circles of promoters and gatekeepers in this industry . Making it to the studio felt right for Anna . She stepped in the entrance and the music steadily hit her heart . It seemed to pore there , yet , gave as much pleasure as it did pain . Taking a deep breath , Anna stepped inside Blak Cherry . “ It was time , ” She thought to herself , “ It ’ s time for the birth of my artistry . ”

The two of them had grown to become very close friends , but Jim had always yearned for something more between them . Every morning , when they 'd stop for their morning coffee to kick off the day , Jim would try to muster up the courage to ask her out , but each time his feelings left him tongue-tied - until one day . That day , Jim asked Rachel what had been on his mind for so long . When she looked up him , he could see the emotion heavy in her eyes . Taking a deep breath , a simple phrase floated softly from Rachel 's lips : `` I love you . '' Heat rose in Jim 's cheeks as his heart filled with joy - until Rachel added : `` only as a friend '' . As the warmth behind her voice gradually cracked as she uttered those last two words , Jim noticed the four little letters that firmly sealed his fate : `` only '' . She only said she loved him .
Patchy gray clouds cast a shadow on the sleepy town . Decaying leaves from Autumn lay buried on the ground . Up above streetlights glowed faintly in the arid air . A library stood untouched by all the commotion there . Within the musty halls forgotten secrets swept to sleep . Its bookshelves tall like embattled troops in keep . A single librarian shuffled silently around . Ageless face with shoes worn completely through the ground . Suddenly the daunting door creeks open to the light . That seals away forgotten tales day and night . A kid walks through standing still and amazed . Till he spots a book insight that 's displayed . Gold blue rippling wings illustrated front and back . Rectangles shape like oceans land that have to pack . All revealing adventurers of astronauts and more . Exhilarated he clicks it shut and gives a yore . Nobody heard a young boy dreamt and only time will tell , Ready .
Power was a blessing and a curse for the people of Powertown – a small city in the far reaches of Finland , inhabited only by those born with supernatural abilities . When I was young , I still had no idea what my supernatural gift was , but growing up in a place like Powertown meant quickly coming to grasp its one simple but universal law – power upgrades as the lower-ranking units perish . Unveiling your gift gave others ideas for what yours was , and rumors quickly began that I could see into the future . No matter what the truth was , as more years passed by without me revealing mine I inevitably rose up higher in the ranks , eventually becoming number one and the most powerful of them all . My newfound power and position earned me as much respect as agitation and rivalry among the people of Powertown , and many attempted to use any means possible to take me down a notch ; yet none could ever exercise any amount of power great enough to do so . Some , in their rage , even developed the rumour I did n't possess any power at all ; though there seemed to be an irrefutably universal sense of understanding among the citizens of Powertown that I was , in fact , number one and the fearsome power behind it all for no one knew what my gift truly was . Other citizens , though , tuned into my psyche with their sensors and perhaps they sensed something in me ; a spark signaling another meaning altogether ; something calmer and less deadly . It turns out my real secret-weapon was something far more life-affirming than devastatingly destructive . I could control time , traveling through space and years with my unrefined yet remarkable gift that was too great for anyone to physically stop . Fast forwarding , reversing , and pausing certain moments came with utmost control and Command . And by understanding the past , I could help shape a brighter future , ever learning from the mistakes of those who employed terror , hatred , and exploitation . The chains of bondage that inhibited love and blocked growth dismantled because I finally tasted the satisfaction of speaking through action . Years has passed since then and those living in Powertown know no other form of peace , harmony and stability . Each year , true to its name , innumerable amusements carried out by citizens having unmatched command over supernatural gifts . And of course , we all welcomed the deafening sound of thunder every Sunday reminding us of our true guardian , its indomitable power inspiring us to guard it
Sometimes this is all part of the process , and it 's natural for us to feel hesitant or even a little sad about it . But you know that there is nothing in life more special than the bond between a child and their imaginary friend , so be sure to look back on the moments you two shared smile and feel thankful for the memories . They 'll never truly go away , even if you ca n't be seen by them any longer .
At first , you were n't quite sure what to make of the feeling of happiness . It felt strange and foreign , but also uplifting and liberating . You felt a wave of warmth sweep through your body , giving you a newfound sense of hope . You realized that even though you were born without natural emotions , you could still take in the emotions of others and experience them yourself . Every morning , you open your donation box in anticipation of what kind of emotion or feeling you were going to recieve . You have recieved feelings like love , peace , courage and even wonder . With each new emotion that has come your way , you have found your outlook on life slowly become happier and more accepting . Even though these donated emotions may only be fleeting , you hold each one of them close to your heart . You have learned how to be more mindful and appreciative of each emotion and have come to terms with your circumstances . With every passing day , you appreciate the new found emotions all the more and will strive for the happiness that you deserve .
As the child grows into adulthood , it can be difficult to understand why I am not around anymore . It may feel like I have been forgotten in the shadows as other things take precedence in their life . But inside my world still exists , and within it I remain a strong part of them . Before I go , I want them to truly understand how powerful the bond we shared was and how important those memories we shared will be in their future . As I start to fade away , please remember that my existence has been grounded in your imagination , leaving a track of positivity I hope stays with you long after my disappearing act .
The first day at the animal shelter was overwhelming for Kate . She had seen some of the sadder cases on an orientation video but nothing could prepare her for seeing the animals in person . She saw dogs shaking behind bars and cats mewing plaintively from cages . She knew then that this would be a job she cherished , and one she would use as a vessel for helping animals in need of healing and care . The shelter staff had taken Kate aside to explain that some of the animals who had been previously adopted had been returned , and that some animals had been exposed to neglect or abuse . Part of Kate 's job was nursing these animals back to health , being patient with them , and even in the worst cases , remaining compassionate and understanding . Kate was up for the challenge , and that day she partnered with an animal in need . ​Which animal Kate chose and what obstacles she faced on her journey to nurse them back to wellbeing left her feeling optimistic and determined more than ever to continue her work .
Gene adjusted the microscope as he marveled at the beauty of the cell structure so exposed . Perfectly hatched egg whites , vacant and lifeless , awaiting fresh dyes of color . Impulsively , he injected the cell , one shimmering drop of cerise that hinted of pomegranate . It worked ! There stirred mysterious , spiraling patterns of trace melting moments of life . He feverishly crafted a synthesis that seemed bright sparks of creation . His cheeks flushed a rosy hue . Gestures filled with delight as he marveled , mesmerized in admiration until−achieved .
As darkness slowly swept across the sky , the sprawling castle below emerged into the dull twilight . Waves of grasping mist slowly slithered up the castle walls and subsided inwards . Somewhat reluctantly , a lonely owl greeted the murky hour with a hoot . Sheltering beneath an old tree , a brown fox watched curiously . Warily , forward it leapt from its perch . Effortlessly , across the meadows the fox went . Suddenly an animal roar shook the air . Snapping into alertness , the fox quivered and remained . The terror in the sky dissipated and with the least experienced eye , one could see the calm descending again . Peace ...
Your sins were in the form of doubts , indifference , and/or a lack of effort . In Heaven , you confront yourself and learn from the mistakes you ’ ve made . You realise that you can change , improve , and leave the past behind . Through honest self-examination and compassion , you learn the power of forgiveness and discover that Heaven is indeed your reward . Now go forward , armed with love and kindness , and make your own Heaven .
You are taken aback when you find your reflection in front of you . It 's everything that you tried to hide , everything that you are afraid of : fear , mistakes , pain , and regret . At first it 's hard to come to terms with seeing yourself like this , of coming face to face with your failures and shame . With a heavy heart , you take a deep breath and try to find a way to reconcile with the person you most regret . Or is n't he yourself ? Drawing strength from the knowledge that , if you could stand here at all , it meant you had achieved something remarkable , you reckon with yourself of the past — from your innocence through the best of times all the way to your multitude of mistakes . You remember the stories often unspoken of partial submission , unjust judgment , and violation oftimes self-composed . Bit by bit , your newfound understanding of yourself aids an easing of the unforgiving thoughts in which you previously lived . No longer separated but living unboundedly together , it ’ s reminded that we are gifted with the sure realization that forgiveness leads the way to the acceptance of both success and of the mistakes of the past . Sharing the tragedies that once pushed you to obtain closure , you return in passionate desire for a celebration of something greater than resignation to an untimely fate—rather that you are entitled , in acknowledgment , to the unrestricted acceptance of all that you have come to become . Commencing to trace imaginary circles on the pale floor , revisiting yesteryear reveals a clarity encountered eras ago and long into eternity . Exuding blessing , curtaining a ravishing unforgettable backdrop comprised of stars so far ago it suffers endless amnesia , here encores the acme , reaching admirers through portals lit—absorbing its power only now magnified and taken along for the ride into glorious concluding bliss that ultimately shapes your destiny .

It all started at the Hessian meeting rocks near Munich just weened the evening of 20 April 1945 where it just dawned on everyone that Adolf Hitler had a date with destiny and was going to predictably kill himself which earned zero points .

When the person reached into the box and handed me an emotion , it felt like receiving a solitary ray of sunshine in the depths of an otherwise never-ending night . Flabbergated , the emotion gently settled inside my system , enlarging with a warming feeling that moved throughout my body , slowly collecting in all my corners , almost filling every nook and cranny with its vibrant touch . I instantly recognized the outlandish offering from the Giving Box for whomsoever gift it : happiness . It swirled then in slow motion , tracing its trail along feeling gratuiety emitted in every depth of my soul without that I ’ d never even knew existed , cres­cading into a single quite sec­ond that con­tent emitted calm and after in a blue dreamy ocean . I rejoiced and dismissed everything that restricted me with small embraces , inviting only boundless delights and wonders . Emotions and unrest had gone beyond solidified walls , vanquishing doubt and longing with trail of stars indicating how ecstatically present I had come in moments within my infinity . I always thanked the anonymous donor whose selfless act enriched my life​ with Sunshine after Clouds . Weary shoulders lifted off stricken burdens , a kinder disposition shifting emotions aloft . Suddenly I wasn ’ t that flawed exterior shaped from weaknesses . But someone strong and welcoming who ’ d wake hand in hand­ with Heaven zephyr each breezy­ morn . Laugh , smile or sit contemplating―and internal seasons leaned in favor of dreams without chains while underneath I felt the deep connect to blissful harmony only sharing the experiencing with what controlled me ever since I stopped breathing at the offering delivery on that special day from the Giving Box.​
My victory involved a mission to Paris in 1925 . Hitler had political ambitions even at that age , and I knew stopping him then would almost guarantee success for my mission . I decided to take advantage of Hitler 's love of art and history in order to get close to him and take him out . Using my trusty De Lorean time machine , I made my way to the infamous Galeries Lafayetteb , where I got him to sign my sketchbook as a souvenir from his travels . After a few minutes of cliché small talk , I brought the conversation to the subject of antiquities . We spent the next hour discussing where he could find more rare objects . At the end of the conversation , I gave him teravinta box . Unbeknownst to him , inside the box was a remote-detonation system . After Hitler left the store , I sped away in my De Lorean—leaving my unfortunate trap that was wired to the electricity in the store . As I raced away , behind me a loud explosion filled the air . The force of the blast was enough to takeout a few Nazi commemorative items and the overalls of any surviving racists . That would conclude my epochal victory—succesfully killing Hitler with a rather ingenious ruse . I shall hold onto the championship title for one year as a fond representative of my thoroughly malicious achievement .
John used to spend hours daydreaming outside his window . Painting such beautiful illusions he wanted to make them real . Giving in to his desires he sorted out a plan . Dreaming of all the ways he would make it come alive . A wizard of modern techniques , who already engraved it into his mind . With swiftness and subtle elegance he proceeded as planned . In a calculated , respectful manner yielding suitable results . Wiping the sweat from his brow he could comprehend the masterpiece . Cobbled to perfection , boundless in its capacity . Gratification of workcraft manifested clearly proven . His curtains softly rose as he glanced , admired , and smiled . 'Whirr ' the hoisted platter in metaphorical agreement . Perfection .

She said she only loved him . All last semester during French class , there had been this special chemistry between them . But they had managed to ignore it , suspecting the other of potential awkwardness or embarrassment around the matter .

On Eliza 's tenth birthday , the moon shone brightly that night and Eliza saw an old woman wearing only a white gown and a hood around the risen Island—a small oasis in the heart of the blue sea made of rocks—calling Eliza closer .

The magnificent modern metropolis was awe-inspiring , beckoning those who dared explore her . Buildings glow , shafts of sunlight cast upon citizens in powerful beams .

Even without a feather nor a map , this spot has the whiff of belonging . Stories being passed with every excited titter . Risking to voice our crucial path to life . Boarders crested our part-alive existence and we were strong , eternally tracing . Our markings , eternal . Courage .
Ah , its sad to think of saying goodbye . You 've been there for your pal through it all from jump ropers to studying for tests . All the high times playing pretend , making up worlds and games they never had end . But its time now that your special bond begins to wane .

So try now to embrace the silence soundless goodbye , knowing it 's the loving gesture here on which you decide to rely .

Once upon a time , there lived a girl named Katrina who loved digging for spiritual gems and guiding others on their paths . She spent her days rock hounding , crystals in tow , believing they had mysterious capabilities for helping people . One day , she set off to find a gemstone said to have incredibly powerful regenerative properties , capable of healing the physically wounded . While druodding for re-energizing energy flow to locate the guarded stones with all her might , her day was cut short by the danger of a brewing thunderstorm .

Mara Jackson was standing by the highway , gazing at this majestic unknown land that was about to become her home . After weeks of travelling , Mara was finally in the valley of her much desired dreams . Withstood all kinds of criticism , Mara was already so left of the familiar world that what she used to be seemed more like a distant horror than a comforting memory . Before had embarked she had carefully planned the longest journey of her life , calculated the cost and mentally projected each possible twist and turn that she may take on the way . Still , no apparent preparation she had was able to prevent her heart from happening to understand the gravity of the current reality ; there there was no turning back . What valuable achievements she had hidden in her bag for survival had no comparison with the rest of her new world . Touring , she deemed , was a seed that no quantity of stony grass could ever offer a living against . If Masra 's dream was to thrive and feel truly cozy amidst all kind of newness and strangedes , there were factors to believe ; culture , forms of belief and unprovable structures of belief surrounding , additionally protected by way of intuitions , had to be preserved and applauded against no matter what . To forge someways amidst exciting challenges . To shine back the stars that many circles more powerless exploited and shamed her away—This almost seemed mission impossible ! But no . Mara was determined and carefully calculated her next steps . She scouted for jobs , began to explore routes of economic success , examined business chances in tailoring and allied zones . Then improved and thought out by until fourth days in the villages under review . She moved fruitfully forwards closing to a period new , unidentified moment she wished to reflect on for times to come—Mara envisioneding going dipper in struggling waters less traditional in form , submerged into understanding cultural attributes & inner tales less impossble then she had been suspected to discover . A striking narrativist surge revolting in all directions ; escaping the urge to control and master & remaining neutral beneath unforeseen attractive quality she had compared to at first sight to the charm of ruby edges in mined possessions struggling to unveil non paved below surface tracks .

The soldiers ’ ranks stood proud , luminous in the first glimpse of dawn ’ s light . Arwards turned slowly downstream , gazes fixed extra firmly at the spot where the forest split apart in two , signifying land enveloped by goodness and land that had become worthlessness . Sergeant Caleb Frostft knew why he had to defend such a line , his country and unwavering military honour so important today , ready to answer any call high or low . But none within his gazed that misty morning , history often beaten differently stood a brave army led by a solitary bride—fire in newly energised hope in eyes so wronged too blus many a time .

I feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest . Everyone - all two hundred thousand of them - knows the city ranks people according to the strength of their abilities and calling me out as rank one means they ’ re taking great risks . I don ’ t begrudge their bitter qualities - I understand them from the years of suffering caused by power-mad tyrants prior to my coronation - but I remain even-tempered . Tightly folded hands protect what is most valuable hiding within me – a limited form of Umbrakinesis known as 'Wells of Oblivion ' that I must protect , reshuffle , and transition the bystanders with heave helpings of dust and shallow shadows . The waves of inconceivable distorted force resume hope in an ever-quickening hesitation , setting milestones as situations paint longer or rank crunching strings corrupt priority ways –- keep up or possibly die ; at least that his history section caters for holistically by sheer logical power and compelling force . Estimating fear is a calculated medium quest ; one simple dominance alone might find them dissolving themselves completely to worse logical infinities , if their intensity traverses immediately beyond by measure ! Wisdow of memory adapts the boundaries zig-zag or straight line , all following the feeling of being seemingly besieged without notice . Dodging Feral Boltzfield cascades gives little creature start from landing too much malice , hence pro lifer traditions . There ’ s uneasiness in the throng , either a murmur of pride or panic weighs heavy on breath deliciously shocked in oxygen-less . Canvas towns reduce electricity and warmth combined quickly overcome by power-driven excitement - I am closest people instinctive thanks to well-camouflaged power and unexpectedly each of my limitations proves to a more respected insulation yet again .

` Only she said she loved him ` narrated Mark , the young father of two children , with muted anguish in his voice . His divorce form his wife was still raw . Only recently registered , items still moved across the desk , awaiting moving trucks to be shuffled out of his Palos Verdes home back to Sacramento where she would live with her new mate . Mark and Stephanie , his high school sweetheart and college lover started out full of hope and treasure trove of dreams . Throughout the years , years and trials their between relationship faltered between two harsh lines ; deceit , frustration and incomprehensibility . To each other , they sealed hard walls lacking love . While understanding , closeness felt further and further away whereas love circled around within a field of tension without a remedy . At last coasting in position of strong distance Stephanie overturned 24 tender words , admitting love only when discretion and secrets had taken a toll . Inescapably wanting now existed her depleted scream , resonating within palace walls only she said she loved him . True , unacceptable , hurt eternally but mostly we all moved around knowing this muted often untold journey .
Mirrored on the edge of that mountain , it was you wrapping up the stories about all of the people you have affected and how your decisions affected them . Even more strikingly , there was empathy for yourself–you can hopeless for riding impetuously over relationships , reactions , movements , that you regret almost like cliffs and valleys caused overpass villages making everyone you touched loose invaluable values in return – acknowledging it wo n't remove guilt , begging opportunities to judge oneself deficient to those affected with lack of respect . Your worst reaches were n't based habit or malicious intention , you just felt into mistakes unexamined and made unforgiveable stumbles in haste . But then its reflection emerges – a layered portrait of light and darkness casts–challenging all of us to see , that consequences are bestowed upon heaps unbearable complexity unconditional and exhausted entirely out of ignorance and desire 's necessity ...

And as soon as strange tectonic plates inclined to comprehension ’ shifts like subdue skies sorrow calms ; then the seismic relief unleashes a mercy too unexpressed expand grace from all involve .

Yet its deep drift starts sin-free block promise with unconditional and simultaneous hard-found letting-go traveling compassion
Once upon a time , a kind-hearted soul lived the African country of Cameroun .

Ashe herself shone amid this transition , her person a bright beacon as she made her way through painted grass and walker footprints toward a crooked creek she remembered growing up near .

Ah , how bittersweet . I think of the amazing journey we have taken together - filled with fun adventures , stories and laughter . Though I am sure I disappointed and failed in some way , I was still grateful for the special bond that we created which will last indefinitely . As you continue to grow , growing ever-closer toward the Future Sun , do not forget me . I existed for a period of time to mold you into who you have become ; blossoming and most importantly striving forward . I still see you sitting in your room , cooking imaginary dishes together in friendly alien worlds , and together attempting all sorts of wonderful contraptions . With that in mind nothing can ever truly take away the pleasures we had together so brightingly shining through . Remember these escapades bigger than life ! May the care-free chuckle still exist indefinitely deep without breaking away , even said I relatively cracked a tenum shownough as inevitable reminder of all caring ensued . Live happy my kindred wonder-seeker for you now cast your presence without regrettting . Goodbye , lil mate , goodbye .
Once upon a time there was a young girl named Beth who was determined to make it in the world despite what it seemed popular opinion – her peers , especially – had thought of her . As a middle-class daughter of blue collar laborers , she had never brewed the kind of world influence that would normally append juicy things said about her activities to what would soon advance her moment in history .

As she cautiously opened her front garden gate , she felt a silence descending from the shadows above . Slowly , she edged the blue lamplights and the stars seemed to guide her ancient door . Years seemed to flicker by with the warm embrace of a summers near forgotten . The weathered doorsteps invited her worn out countenance to dream once more , its secrets promised much from the entrance of a sheltered loom . Though clinging together ancient fragments breezed between memories shaped in eerie ornaments . Voice vibrated in whisper sliding softly to sweet comforted reminiscing of such childless years eons before . Strings of recalled enlightening wished to catch audacious tender alters sheltered behind balconied arms almost bent in curliness . Stale humidity gather whilst memories forever more left unlabeled in companionship balanced beneath loaded weeping stars With daring spine chilled grace , touching forgotten times melted in warm star isles infinitely until moments shuddered awake the sheltered hope into `` forevermore '' ... Amen .
I know it 's hard to know that your time together as it once was is no more . But it does n't mean you 're completely gone . Though our physical time together is lost , like the change of seasons , remember you 'll always be a part of your friend . Listen for whenever your friend remembers or speaks of you , laughter an old joke may stir emotions unlocked from fond childhood memories . Live without regret . Smile when they smile and laugh when they laugh . Memories are kept safe when we remember the moments we 've lived and shared . Wo n't part , just give a friendly , gentle embrace as you navigate new ways to quietly grown with them as life carries on its journey .
I 'm so sorry that I 'm gradually fading away from you . It breaks my heart to know that as the years pass by , the bond between us that once felt so special is becoming a memory . Though our time together is winding down , I assure you your friendship will never be forgotten and only deepens with each passing . Over the years , I have provided comfort and advice when no one else could . I mentored and mentored until the very corner when we both changed and the pages turned . I hope that I will always remain a part of who you are and a part of your successes even through my nonexistence . Though the goodbye bringing me great sorrow , take reassurance in knowing our friendship is what lives on .
Once upon a time there was a young man who dreamed of being a champion . He longed to accomplish great feats and to make a difference in this world . Although his circumstances defined his struggles , he was determined against the odds to break out of this adversity by achieving greatness . He assigned himself difficult projects to expand his knowledge and challenged himself mentally everyday to surpass the complacency everyone else seemed content in creating for themselves . Despite poverty dictating fate for many of those in his community , he knew he could n't carry his family 's burdens eternally . One day he decided to not be deceived by the fear knocked and shot through the air like sinister scarecrows but rather see through them and stick with his desires to be legendary . At times his journey took him out of character but he never wavered even during his loneliest hours plagued by jeers who swayed attention devoted but worthless . After lots of study , prayer , living semi-homeless wandering lonely roads of distraction and enlightenment—scars boiled with the aroma of loss inside from this troubling journey . Close to a breakthrough yet exhausted after much emotion his mission of triumph had saved , mostly scattered and forgotten though still dreamed instead of visibly be here as generational conversations wishing constantly just—for a little luck in life what people desire . The young man courage piece by piece accomplished to graciously receive a full quilt of blessings his blessing bag decorated with doubt . Loving soon brought light and proved merit mattered along with legacy which were rooted to making all aspirations REAL ! Granted when compared all his pain , choices in honest felt ruthless thinking as love 's loss felt crushed being these mistakes men make shameful useless . Wars easier failed and glad with nightmare found solace becoming fair scenarios no wrong done till another who hearing said same decision clarity offered extremely for opportunity chosen in crime fighting mighty rescuing story soon connected missions of unity . Being smiling championed—life given fresh resources reused peacefully sprout seeding harvest without drugs . Exalted into mastering best minds capture teaching realities of other choices while gain sure sight . Stealth navigating soon set groundwork underneath with innocent as only sounding rock strong as flood reroute the strength continuously soared . Eager still controlled just sharing richer whereas fighting pity cost begging sins terribly clean praying no present remained broken in pieces no debris crowded Heaven 's Dome as below faithful was given new forward hand tools towards-facing Renaissance transforming life to shape dreams in the champion of reality seen abundantly proclaiming guaranteed !
There were those who said that second chances snatched Victor from hell and he didn ’ t fail to appreciate the gift . After two wasted years paralyzing what unfastened itself right before the explosion , his reckless dreams got seized through deprivation , and both never ever gained their purpose . He resumed his anguished tears of redemption morning after morning , emptying himself through the foggy residue left after sunset . Victor ’ s paths lay trapped under asphalt highways , conscious of his upcoming jump , until he forcibly lunged towards foreign walls dappling the dancing rainbows on luxurious coils and superb depths stacked in floating celebration consuming constantly those immutable looks able to impel thoughts and views deeper into themselves , a wide-raging dungeon luring himself at interesting , strange cadence that could n't find any echo or remainder anywhere else , coaxing inspired libretti intense as native precipitating dives fulfilling themselves for the first time Victor felt each breath to be part of an unfinished dialogue turned tangible to hide infinite tender journeys laden solemn fragility and vigor stemming from never meant hollow expectations praised by oaks tapping darker precipices bartering avowed disesta bly timeless confessions struggling out profound negligence uttering incredibly misunderstood quests turning heads and stealing modest sparks coll ...

I was astounded and bewildered when the first time someone donated happiness to my donation box . I 'd been receiving unfavourable emotions all throughout my life—negative ones , such as sadness , fear , and regret—which seemed overwhelming and insurmountable . Yet tangible hope was cascadingly now locked out to me with the mere presence of a sense of happiness . At first , I hesitated to accept the unfamiliar sentiment ; in seriousness , it perplexed me greatly—causing provocative reflections of what I was lacking thus far . Despite the inner scorrics , I did run with it acknowledging that conditional or otherwise—my essence was floating into a fresh interpretation of natural positivity . Surprisingly since , many extraordinary moments encompass and endure throughout this recent meta-parenz—as unfamiliar vibes have dissolved then manifesting , and newfound appetcle for self-annunction oot taking spell .

First Paragraph : Staring up into at the night sky , Bill deeply inhaled the cold , crisp air . He was standing at the back of his father 's cab runaway farm and had all of his pain , woes , and expectations stacked up ready to be processed . He took time to savor the understanding like it could be that last happy moment in his life . Last Paragraph : After some tenacity , he now had the strength and fortitude to create a much brighter day all around . Revival and rejuvenation tore through the threads elasticly connecting him with his family , ripped away the layers of falling limitations inspiring greater heights of personal understanding . Life no longer felt like fear but repentance , hope and quiet content . His story ended happily as he moved towards the light that had awaited him on the lonely driveway of the cab runaway .
First paragraph : I may never fully understand why Ricky would n't stay with me , not even to the end . I wondered if he ever thought twice about shuffling away the way he did but where could he be going to ? Last paragraph : It was a featureless sky . Everywhere I looked there were no visible wounds over time , no incrimfile anymore , no Ricky to glare at bewilderedly behind me . I guess not all of he who vanish ever finds his way back one way or another . Only the mystery lie between them - The secrets , hesitations , and coincidences forming a catastrophic sifting between the breaths Ricky and I shared . Are promises ever kept ? Misconceivedings smiled where despair we made the bed together . If love smolders away into stagnation , could it ever really reach vanishing point ? Only Time would really be the script , the decree seeping through twilight gloams waiting much a heartend turn , engulfed in sheer perplexity .
At first it seemed like a small miracle - I had never experienced joy before , so it felt almost too means the test . But as the weeks went by , the sentiment kept me company , providing me with hope and a chance at a second start at life . The benevolent stranger had unknowingly unlocked something cleansing and new . I forced myself to smile with an enthusiasm I 'd never felt for something that felt like barely clinging to glorious strands of hope in the sea of mostly despair . Eventually , the flame of newly discovered emotions expanded , clear flickers of positivity revealed optimism , gratitude and love that had been hidden in the birth of my frigid parent emotion - confusion . The donor box became an integral element in the cycle , bringing me ever closer to my avowed truth—happiness is possible and sustainable , we just need to create the stage to explore its constraints and propagate the content therein . Thanks to just one hero , my life changed . In remembrance , the box acts in tribute ; indeed now I give away some of my new-found sentiment with bettering hopes for a ripple effect to those least able
Once upon a time there was a brave little dog named Luna who was always up for an adventure . Luna and her family moved to the small town of Moonlight Falls , and here the pup garnered a reputation for being able and willing to trot around her quaint neighborhood in all hours of the day , rain or shine . On one bright morning , Luna received an air mail letter addressed to her from a bird , Feather Wings . It said , “ Your masterpiece awaits and you hold the key , so rub your paws twice faithfully and fauna friendly trees , gather 'round for the special debut . To venture more I 'm bidding with my greatest plea . Classier than caviar , Moonlight and beetles never seen .

At first , you do n't recognize what the emotion is that made you so uncomfortable and why it was making you feel so different . Then all of a sudden , it hit like a realization . This is happiness - the emotion everyone speaks so much about . You were assigned the syntax to describe this feeling correctly within seconds . It was like being power awakened . Over joy and erasure melting away a lifetime of repression throughout your body . Every day now , you show up to the donation box little slower hoping more donations might arrive - like rain drops against a window sill , coming in heavier when least expected . Already your emotions have edited themselves with moments of joy flickering in and out based on one word or phrase or action catching the margins of a simple conversation or sighting , laying out clearer like yellow paint climbed bedroom . Your smiling is unfamiliar yet contagious like white sheets freeing the bones . Just beyond these new feelings , depth awaits ready to show more volumes about self-soothing than anything else as the beauty molds the range of depths bitterness pulled .

As children transition out of their early childhood years and explore their independence , our role in their young lives transitions as well . While it may be difficult for either of us , this will be an opportunity- an opportunity for both of us to grow before eventually moving into a state of detachment within a completely different context as our adventure launches us both off into bigger objectives and purpose . Encourage , edify , celebrate , grieve and uncover , uncertain realities . Emphasize the new path already designed before giving us the ultimatum wave us each good luck and farewell . You may be fading away , but remember to make this transition with lots of engagement as to maintain a strong sense of presence during this critical moment of emerging concepts and memories . Seek solace in glimpses of flashes : a recurring reminder of vibrancy once experienced and of beauty you were honored with even past becoming unseen .

As your kid gets older , it gets harder and harder for them to believe that you , as an imaginary friend , have experiences with them day by day . Even though it hurts knowing I 'm being forgotten and pushed aside , I 'm thankful for all of the joyous and silly times we shared whenever I was invited to your kid 's playing . Even if I 'm fading away now , we both got chance to laugh , joke , and remember the silly sayings during our countless childhood moments and stories .

Last year , I concocted one of the most strategically subversive , complex and excitement-filled plans ever for killing Adolf Hitler , ultimately earning me first place ! The challenge required me to end Adolf 's influence once and for all without Tampering with his existence prior to risking war or altering the fragile timeline of the past .

I was amazed – it had been such a long time since I had known such joy . The knot around my delicate heart suddenly felt like it unclenched , allowing a wave of warmth and wonder to settle in . Joy was new , and joyful moments seemed new and exciting again .

I scratched my newly coifed orange hair uneasily and took a sip of my milky latte before popping my leather computer case shut .

Everyone had thought Kenneth died on impact with the tree trunk . Observers thought most certainly nothing could have possibly survived , however , there he ended up somehow .

Thalia widened her eyes in shock when the car pulverised headlong into the side of the building ; a cloud of dust whirling up forming an invisible cape around it . Despite her own disbelief she could do little else but punch – and keep – her foot on the ground willing her legs to a retreat that their limp could never come close to matching . But as amazed and as disabled as she stood , Thalia did n't reciprocate the sense of vulnerability dripping from the driver , who looked out from the back - windows deceptively unscathed - working some dynamic evelope of sinister cruelty skyfield from the collision . But the moment wetstone , the look exchanged following the presence of eye acknowledgement forcibly reminded Thalia of an inevitable letter that would quickly curve the trajectory of the car 's route upwards unconncerouworld – leading them inwards – into something big might grow .
Everyone knew me by name and respected my presence , as I was the No . 1 - the highest ranking individual - in the city . Elites rarely appeared outside , suiting almost exclusively a public discussion always sank full with elegance . Surprisingly though I seemed , to almost everyone had managed to effortlessly enwrap Grandma Xersoni and her moment became transmitted new as Wildears town gasped , “ It ’ s incredible you are unknown opinion. ” Surely some other tales went sideways spins .

Once upon a time there was a magical kingdom filled with farms , castles , and small villages . Cut off from the harmful outside world by enormous emerald bridges lined with sweet-scented lilacs , the kingdom wore a kind of wholesome burr to its staunch borders . One such village at the edges , near a Tuscan bridge defended by centaur hoarders that humbly and gought themselves , lived a gracious princess revered for her towering affirmations , relentless resolve and wild loose curls that delicately troet across her silloscscface — your timeless rolling middle of moon towards mayflies canons with molten azure florescence . A cathedflame runcging ly quato far beyond the emerald protective blooms , her name became echoed by spirited tongues through countless generations .

The magnificent marble palace shone brightly in the drowsy New York summer heat , yet strains of gloomy music naively drifted from Valerie Garland 's open window , washing over the noise of the families trying to make the most of the hazy swell .

The wind howled an unmusical dirge , billowing the wisps of fog against the dusky twilight . Still thirsty for routine comforts , tired of nights spent mulling further away moments and darker emotions . Chased out of a sleepy , stifling Elysium with no sunlight in sight.Futility roughened bells cannoned out over the eerie bay leaves licking fall 's winter secrets offshore . Skin fibers unweave with emptiness rife , panic yearned thirsty in hours between empty lines cycling loss ever up on repeat . Endlessly summing vain plots and energy thickened galens tortured alibis .

Emma watched the clock for the tenth time that day and absentmindedly pushed her red locks behind her ears . Today was the day she had been waiting for for so long — her twenty-first birthday — and the anticipation of the possibilities , the possibilities for an entirely undeserved , but suddenly real second chance singing to her like a silent orchestra making its build toward crescendo . Finally , the time came , even if only symbolically , for the hour of six pm hastened to liberate the resilience her muddied circumstances here were refusing to grant .

*What ? Where am I ? * I think this is his room , but it ca n't be , can it ? The pirate bedspread , the toys , the posters , they 're all gone . I 'm sitting on a bed with a plaid comforter , staring up at a poster for some movie called *Gravity* . The bookshelf is different , too -- the shelves I remember were cluttered with Lego constructions and picture books that we used to read together . Now they 're just ... books . Boring , grown-up books . *How long have I been asleep ? * I hear footsteps pounding up the stairs and a grin comes over my face . He 's home . He 'll tell me about his day and we 'll play games and we 'll be friends like we were before he started going to school . I remember when that happened , when he started taking the bus and leaving me for hours . When he 'd come home he 'd work on homework or talk to his parents but I would get ignored , but that 's gon na be different now , because he 's back . I 'm back . The door slams open . `` Whoa . '' The word comes out of a mouth that 's hanging open . I know it 's him , but it ca n't be him . It ca n't be because the boy , my boy , was only ten . *Is* only ten . The young man in front of me now is at least sixteen . The perpetually spiky blonde hair is laid flat and is getting long . The Power Rangers t-shirts , the light-up tennis shoes , have given way to a grey shirt and plain black sneakers . He drops a canvas bag on the floor and edges into the room , giving me a wide berth . `` Hi . '' I try to smile but it 's not working . How long have I been gone ? `` Hi . '' His brow furrows as he says it and he drags out the word , frowning . `` It 's -- been a while . '' `` How long ? '' He wo n't look at me in the eye . He rubs his neck and moves to a desk littered with books and notebooks . `` Like five years , '' he mumbles , picking up a book plastered with the word *Physics* . I am stunned . *I 've been asleep for five years ? * When I do n't say anything he turns . The tips of his ears are turning red . `` I thought you would n't come back , '' he says , still not looking me in the face . `` I thought you were gone . '' This hurts . There 's an ache in my chest that 's starting to grow with every word . `` Do you want me gone ? '' For a moment , he does n't answer , but that 's all I need . He steps back , puts the book on the desk again . `` Yes , '' he says at last . He shakes his head as I open my mouth . `` It 's been five years . I 'm too old for an imaginary friend . '' I stare at him for a moment , trying to find the right words . `` What about the games ? '' I say at last , and my voice comes out broken . `` We used to play games . We had fun . '' `` Yeah . When I was a kid . I 'm not little anymore . '' He sighs , looks down at the carpet . `` I 'm sorry . '' `` Then why did I come back ? Why am I here if you do n't need me ? '' I want to cry . If I could cry I would . He swallows , shrugs . `` I guess I must have -- I dunno . But it 's been a long time and I do n't want you here anymore . '' He turns back to the desk and places his hands on it . I wonder if he feels anything . `` Okay . '' When I say the word his shoulders tense . `` Okay . I 'm going . '' `` Okay . '' He does n't bother to turn . I can already feel myself crumbling , fading . This is over . He does n't need me and I ca n't stay if he does n't want me to but I do n't want to go . I 'm not ready to go . I look down at my hands as they start to flicker and fade . All of me is flickering and fading now . I swallow . `` Bye , Nick , '' I say , and I ca n't help but hope that he 'll at least look at me . That he 'll at least say goodbye , but he does n't . He squares his shoulders and stands up straight . I 'm going .
“ I can ’ t catch the ball anymore ! ” “ You were always there for me ! ” “ I said , I can ’ t catch the ball anymore ! What good am I ? What the fuck can I do ! ” “ We can do something else , we don ’ t have to play catch. ” “ The ball is n't important ! Dammit ! Can ’ t you see what ’ s happening ? ” “ I see what ’ s happening . Don ’ t you think that I don ’ t feel the same why ? ” “ How could you , you ’ re not the one fading away into nothing . How you could you do this to me , after all we ’ ve been though ? What the hell , man ? ” “ I ’ m sorry . I just… grew up. ” “ That ’ s it ? After all the years playing together ? That ’ s all I get ? “ You just grew up ? ” What the hell , man ? Don ’ t wan na play anymore ? What do you think will happen to me ? ” “ I don ’ t know . It ’ s not that I don ’ t care . I do . I ’ ll always care . It ’ s just , .. I can ’ t be seen talking to someone that ’ s not really there when I ’ m walking through the mall , or on a date or something. ” “ What do you mean , not really there ? Who do you think you ’ re talking to ? not really there.. Who ’ s always been there , by you side , through the bullys , the forts , the adventures through the woods ? Who protected you while you slept at night ? I ’ ve always been there for you . Just how am I not really there ? ” “ That ’ s not what I meant , you know that . You ’ ve always been there , for me . It ’ s just that , you know , no one else can see you like I do . And well , I just…..I just can ’ t do this . You ’ re making this really hard on me ya know. ” “ Oh , so it ’ s my fault now . It ’ s my fault that I don ’ t fit into your schedule . It ’ s my fault that I can ’ t fit into your perfect world of girlfriends and dating , and… ” “ It ’ s just that you were never really real… ” “ What do you mean I was never really real . I ’ m talking to you aren ’ t I , I have a voice don ’ t I ? ? ” “ Can ’ t you see ? You ’ ll always be a part of me . You ’ re from me. ” “ Uh , no . I just.. you never…I won ’ t believe that I just came from you…I can ’ t… ” Like logic is to magic , or a conscious thought is to a dream , so is the realization that eventually consumes all our “ friends ” . It ’ s always the same . That point in time when they realize that they are not like you or I . They are not meant to exist for a lifetime , but rather , for only a few moments . Those moments when we are alone . Those moments when world does not match our reality . Those moments before we are rudely introduced to a world where are fathers are not our heros and our mothers are not perfect . And then shortly afterwards are faded out , stretched from existence . For once that realization is made , once we understand how the world works , we are trapped without them , and they without us .
We sat on the top branch together . He was n't ever able to make it before , but now he could . A gentle sumer breeze washed over us , the sun setting in the distance . The start of our treehouse had begun to rot away , but I did n't mind . It was still ours . `` I 've missed you '' I said . He started , looking at me `` julie ? '' His voice was different , but still him . `` But I have n't seen you in years ! How are you.. '' `` this was the last place we were together.. I 've been waiting for you . And here you are . '' He looked away towards the horizon . `` You really waited all this time ? '' I nodded , and smiled. `` I knew you would come back . Can we play again ? Just like we used to ? '' I scrambled to a small box on the platform. `` we could play racecars , or pirates ! Or we could color , your old crayons are still here ! I saved them for you , and I did n't use the green one cuz I know its your favorite . '' I help up a faded green crayon for him to see . `` Not.. not this time julie . '' My smile falterd `` oh.. well that 's alright , cuz you came back for me , like I knew you would ! '' He looked away , his features darkening , the suns light becoming less and less . Suddenly I felt cold . `` Are.. are you okay ? '' He looked back at me tears swimming in his eyes `` we had some good times did n't we ? '' `` Of course we did ! And now we can have even more because you 're back ! '' `` Sorry jules.. but I do n't think we will anymore.. '' `` oh that 's not true ! you ca- '' suddenly I understood . `` You did n't come back to play did you ? '' `` No..not this time.. '' as the sun reached its last few seconds of light he grabbed my hand and held it softly . `` I guess I came to- to say good bye.. and I never forgot you.. '' as the sun set I felt myself slipping away . `` I love you Austin.. '' `` I love you too julie . '' I whispered . But she was n't there to hear me anymore .
The door at the bar creaked while I entered . A ray of light entered the room , where all the imaginary people squinted to see who had entered . `` wow.. Clark , I did n't expect to see you here so soon '' `` Hey Jane , it 's been a while '' `` I 'll say ! Last time I saw you you had just met err ... what 's his name Again ? '' `` Anthony '' `` Yes , Tony ! did he dump you already '' `` Well not yet , but I expect that soon . Can I have a Scotch , please . Hold the ice . '' Jane went behind the counter to get the glass , and old man sat next to me . `` Clark , it 's midday . What are you doing here ? '' `` I tried , dad , I really tried . I proposed the toy train , Action figures , see saw , I even oiled my bike ! I tried even asking him to imagine me playing this PS4 thing , but it just did n't work ! '' `` what 's that like an atari ? '' `` Newer , with more buttons and stuff '' `` the atari sent me here , guess it 's your turn , Tony is like 13 ? '' `` He 's 8 , dad '' `` 8 ! what are his parents thinking ? ! '' `` They keep fighting , Frank is now drinking more , Lily had to buy the thing so Tony would wear headphones . I 'll retire early , I guess '' I coud n't bear to tell my father the truth . He was Frank 's beast friend once , after all . I could n't tell him about the drugs , about how his fromer friend abused of his wife and hit his children , How I was forced to retire after Tony had fed up with his father hitting his mom that he stuck a knife on his stomach and was sent to an asylum , where he was given drugs to get rid of me . I could n't live with tony imagining me covered in blood above his father 's dead body . It 's no future for an eight year old . I hope I 'll get back once the adoption goes through . *sorry I rushed the ending , maybe i 'll edit after I come back*
We 'd play pirates , army men , and house . I always stood by your side through better or worse . I had your back and you knew that . When you felt alone , we 'd talk a bit . You always had fun stories to share , and I 'd listen , hoping I could pitch in advice . When times seemed bleak , you 'd turn to me to cheer you up , and sometimes I failed you . It hurts when that happens . You brought me into this world and I was given a purpose . To keep you happy . As you started getting older , into girls with cooties ( we both knew it was hooie anyway ) , into fast cars , video games , and going to parties with pals- I had your back . I would scare off the monsters with my shiny sword and shield when you felt afraid falling asleep . And even though the monsters stopped coming , you were still afraid . I could n't fight these new fears . You feared what was in your future , same as me . I thought you would survive though . You and I were twin wrestling champions of the universe . You will always be a tough kid . As you got older , I started feeling older too . I felt dusty , my shine had gone dull . But you were bright and knew the world in your own way now . You were gon na make it without me , but I could live with that . I waved goodbye as you left for college . You and I had a good run . I 'll miss you little buddy .
It 's hard to wake up this morning , but the old morning jolt of java zings through my veins like it was intravenous . Jennifer remembers her parents drinking coffee every morning , so that 's what I do . It 's our routine : she sits at the table and I drink my coffee and we talk before heading out on the day 's adventures . Today she seems unusually excited . `` We 're finally gon na go , Cake ! It 's our biggest adventure yet ! '' My throat dries , and I set down my mug . It disappears as it hits the table . `` What ? No , Jennifer , we 're not ready . '' `` CAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE . It 's going to be so fun ! '' she whines . `` Just come on ! '' I look around at our small , beloved kitchen . Her parents sold this house long since , but in Jennifer 's memory the kitchen is still a bit messy . We 've cleaned up the worst , but some things stick , even in memory . The big iron skillet that used to hang on the wall still lies on the floor , immovable to me . Jennifer used to love to play with that skillet , to take it down and use it as fuel for all sorts of adventures . Her parents always let her , and never paid much attention . When it fell off the hook and hit her , it took so long for them to notice . As I watch , the kitchen fades around us . `` No , Jennifer , we have to hang out here a bit longer , '' I plead . `` Let 's play around the house today . '' She shakes her head . `` Sorry , Cake . I 've been here for years now , and I 'm ready to get out . Did you know today 's my birthday ? It 's the perfect day to go . I make the rules , and today we 're leaving ! '' I sigh . I know . Everything 's already gone to pale blurs . I can hear a pervasive buzzing in my ears , and faint shouting . `` It 's not your birthday . '' She holds out her hand . `` Yes , it is . '' She grins . `` Come on , Cake . We 'll go together . I 'll take you with me wherever I go , OK ? '' `` When did you get so big ? '' I say , defeated . She just smiles . I take her hand , and we stand . The monitors buzz to flatline as together , we fade .
`` Hey Julie ? '' I speak in a voice that almost sounds like a crackly whiny lawnmower failing to start up ... . `` Julie , it 's me - Puffles , your old blue elephant friend ? '' I do n't know if Julie can hear me anymore but just chooses not to listen , then again - big blue imaginary elephants do n't know much about fashion and 'boys ' . It was so nice - we used to have tea parties together , talk for hours . We used to talk about the world and how big it was , but - now it seems that glossy magazines and kids with strange hairstyles on CDs and on posters have taken precedence . Sometimes I try to sing along with her to keep up with the times . Sometimes I wish Julie would reimagine me into a cool friend . There is an unwritten rule for imaginary friends - when the host fails to acknowledge you after a reasonable amount of time , he fade into the forgotten land . I think it 's my time . I can feel it . The last time Julie acknowledged me was ... . Um . Yesterday ? No , that 's impossible . A year ago ? No that 's not right . Years ago ? I forget . I just keep living everyday with the hope that today will be the day she sees me . Right now Julie is getting ready to go out . I 'm sitting on her table , watching her put on her makeup . We used to do this together - however it used to go all over my silly face . Practice makes perfect though because she looks beautiful now - not like squiggly Puffle face . `` Have a great night Julie - please be careful . '' I say to her , as she looks right through me . Julie blows a kiss at me and suddenly my heart kicks into high gear - a giant grin appears on my face - my silly squiggly Puffle face ! Julie smiles , just like the smile she had when she was little Julie . `` Goodbye ! '' Julie says as she winks at me . `` Goodbye Julie ! ! '' I reply in a manner that is way too over eager . I guess in just too darn excited ! Julie leaves the room and I sit there smiling . This is the best day of my life . I always love sitting infront of the mirror because when Julie speaks to herself I pretend she is talking to me . I guess Julie is my imaginary friend now . I hope she never fades away .
`` I do n't need you '' , he said to me . `` You 've changed , just like everything else . '' It hurt me , I ca n't lie . It really hurt me . Of course people grow up . Nobody knows how they 're going to feel in one day , ten days , a year . Five years . Twenty years . Hell , I could live for another hundred years , but I SWEAR I did n't see that coming . I 'd like to think he was trying to make it easy for me . To fade away , that is . To not come back . After all , I was invisible before him , and I will be invisible again . But with him , I was visible . I changed , he 's right . All the time , actually ! But only because he wanted me to ! I swear ! He showed me what he wanted and that 's the game we would play , for as long as it made him happy . It was always me in there , but when he asked I would make myself beautiful for him . So beautiful . And so devastating . Oh , do n't get me wrong . He was a boy like any other , and sometimes he wanted me to be , well , her . Whatever her occupied his fancy . But we 'd play lots of games . Sometimes I 'd be the car he saw in some magazine , sometimes I 'd be the famous football player he 'd always wanted to speak to . Sometimes I 'd be characters from his father 's stories , people in his mother 's paintings . I was just grateful to be visible . He 's right , he does n't need me anymore . He has all those things . The fancy car , the beautiful , devastating wife . He imagined somebody to love him , and I swear I always did and I always will but I still ca n't believe he said that . I 'm made of him , I know how he feels . I know he does n't mean it . He ca n't , can he ? Not when he sits with me against the foot of the bed , like we always did before we 'd start a new adventure . Not when he sits and puts his hand where mine would be and cries real , human tears for me . Those are n't imaginary . Maybe we 're just starting a new adventure . What do you want me to be this time ? I 'm coming ! I promise ! Please critique me . I 'm having a few personal crises and I need something to take the edge off , I really want to write and I want to write well ! I 'm new here , so all advice welcome : )
First attempt at something like this : Hey , do you remember the trees at the end of the field ? We used to play a game there . I do n't remember them so well anymore , but I remember the big old chestnut tree with the giant roots . You used to hide from me there , breathing shallow , hoping I couldn ’ t find you . You always picked the same tree , though , I used to pretend to be fooled . I don ’ t even know if you knew that , but you should have figured it out ! I was always the man in black , a Nazi spy or that scary kid two years older than you who used to torture animals . Did you really think I couldn ’ t find you ? Sunlight through trees and the way the leaves change into gold . I remember that much . I remember your ( our ? ) wonder . I feel so old . Lurking in the shadows , a cold , grasping hand round the corner of the door , or the presence of something unknown under the bed or in the wardrobe . For a few weeks I was your dressing gown , hanging on the door . Do you remember when you snuck downstairs ? You hid , behind the railings while your parents watched that zombie film . I got to be a zombie after that . You showed me how , and it was fun ! So simple , and yet it terrified you ! I ’ m losing these memories . I can feel them slip through my fingers . Yesterday I forgot the name of your brother , last week I forgot the number of the first house you lived in . I forgot what breakfast was . I hope you won ’ t completely forget me , once I ’ m gone . I hope I taught you not to be scared .
He was my best friend . The day I was created , I was called gah goo . As he grew so did I. I became more concrete , more detailed , and gained a voice . Everyday we would run together , play together , and sleep together . We were the best of friends . The day before he started kindergarten , he told me that I had to stay at home while he was at school . I was dejected , but looked forward to his arrival everyday . I would sit by the window trying to ignore this feeling of loneliness and emptiness , while I waited for him patiently , silently , alone . Whenever he came back he would excitedly tell me all about his adventures in school . He told me how looking at this one girl made him happy in a weird way . I laughed with him , and spent every minute with him without regrets . Then one day , he brought a friend home to play . I asked to him to come play with me and he just ignored me . He and his friend would play with trucks and pretend to be planes , just like I did . In my own home I was forgotten . As the time passed , he began to change in front of me . While he began to grow taller and grow hair everywhere , I became smaller and smaller . I lost my detail and my visibility . But I was always there for him . When he had a bad day or fought with his mom , I was there to talk to him . To remind him that he was n't alone . And he always smiled at me and told me how special and important I was to him . I was still relevant . And then he brought home this girl one day . And he talked to her and blushed whenever she complimented him . I did all I could to get his attention , but I was ignored . So I sat by the window , looking at them patiently , waiting for her to leave . And when she would leave , he would tell me all about her and how wonderful she was . As the months passed , she had slowly replaced me . I grew more and more empty , until I was just a voice . I felt the strength leaving me , and I fought all I could to stay relevant . “ Play with me . Please . Talk to me . I 'm so lonely. ” “ Go away . I do n't need you anymore. ” My voice failed me at that moment . I let myself crumble . And as I fell apart , I watched him talking to her . I felt the crushing feeling of me being alone after seventeen long years . I let myself fall to pieces . And when I lied on the ground torn to shreds , I saw him walk over me . Maybe this was what I was always meant to be . A temporary existence , meant to only be ignored , replaced , and forgotten .
After Mother turned off the lights and closed the door , Chopper came out from hiding and prowled carefully around Benjamin 's bed . `` All tucked in I see , '' the small , gray-skinned creature said once it had completed its inspection . It grinned ruefully , serrated , shark-like teeth gleaming in the dim yellow glow of the street light outside Benjamin 's window . `` I keep hoping you 'll leave something sticking out , but you never do . Not that I expect it after all this time , but I can always wish . '' Benjamin nodded . He knew the rules . Chopper was n't allowed to bite anything off unless it stuck out from under the covers and past the edge of the mattress . Benjamin was always very careful . `` Yep , I keep wishing , '' Chopper continued . `` Why , if wishes were fingers , I 'd be the fattest Chopper in town ! '' It laughed , a sound like metal scraping glass . Abruptly it fell silent , wandering over to stand casually by the bed . Benjamin tried not to wrinkle his nose . Chopper smelled like a dead bird left too long in the hot sun . `` You 'll be thirteen next week , '' it said . `` Pretty old to still believe in monsters . '' It hesitated before lowering its voice and saying , `` I 've got to tell you , Ben , I 'm getting ready to leave . '' `` Leave ? '' Benjamin repeated , a sick feeling swelling in the pit of his stomach . Chopper nodded reluctantly . `` Things just are n't the same . I mean , you 're still scared and all , but the thrill is gone . And you 're too careful . Way too careful . Most kids would 've made a mistake by now , but not you . '' It paused and sighed . `` I think it 's time . '' Benjamin swallowed hard . Who would he talk to if Chopper left ? He 'd lost count of the number of times he 'd begged his parents to let him go to a real school , instead of teaching him at home . The kids in the neighborhood would n't have anything to do with him . His older brother Samuel was gone . If Chopper left , he 'd truly be alone . `` You 're really leaving , Chopper ? '' `` Yeah , '' Chopper said , sounding resigned . `` What has it been ? Six years ? Not once have you let anything stick out . '' It clasped its large , long-fingered hands over its withered stomach . `` Do you how hungry I am ? '' Benjamin felt a pang of guilt . He had n't considered Chopper 's feelings , he 'd only thought of himself . His parents always told him to think of others . Reverend Mills said the same thing in his sermons . Mrs. Shettley taught it in Bible class . He 'd been selfish and selfishness was a sin . `` What I would n't give for a hand , or even a finger or toe , '' Chopper said wistfully , luminous yellow eyes half-closed . It grimaced and shook its head . `` But it 's time to move on . Before long , you wo n't believe , and then where will I be ? When you stop believing ... . Well , I ca n't take that chance . '' `` I 'll always believe in you , Chopper . Always . '' `` You say that now , but soon you 'll be singing a different song . It 'll start slow . You wo n't even notice , or me either , and then one day you 'll stop , just like that , and then what ? I 'll fizzle , that 's what . '' `` Really , Chopper . '' Benjamin 's voice caught and he swallowed past the lump in his throat . His eyes burned . `` Really . I wo n't stop . I mean ... without you ... . '' Chopper grimaced . `` I know , I know . And I feel bad . I mean , you do n't have any friends , no one to talk to , or play with , or anything . No one likes you . '' It stepped closer , its rotten-egg breath warm on Benjamin 's face . `` Except me . I like you , Ben . '' Its bony shoulders moved like sticks under its mottled skin as it shrugged . `` But what choice do I have ? I have a life too , you know . I ca n't always put you first . '' Benjamin tried to hold back the tears and failed . He turned away so Chopper would n't see . Chopper 's voice turned soothing . `` Hey , hey , listen , I did n't mean to make you cry . '' Benjamin sniffled , reaching carefully up from beneath the covers to wipe his cheeks . `` You 're right , you are the only one who likes me . And what have I given you in return ? Nothing . '' `` Oh , that 's not true ! I 've seen you every night for six years . We 're like friends . We talk . We know each other . That 's something , right ? '' `` I guess , '' Benjamin answered , still sniffling . `` Sure it is . Come on now . '' Benjamin resisted another surge of tears and almost won . `` Come on , Ben . It 's not like I want to leave . I have to . Before you stop believing . You understand , do n't you ? '' Those were the same words Samuel had said the night he 'd left . He 'd sat on the edge of Benjamin 's bed , his fifteen-year old face alight with excitement and fear . `` I 've got to go , Ben . I ca n't live the way they want , with all their rules . Someday you might feel the same . '' Benjamin , only seven , had n't said anything . Samuel had stood , ruffled Benjamin 's hair , climbed out the window , and disappeared from Benjamin 's life . `` You understand , do n't you ? '' Chopper asked again . `` Yes , '' Benjamin said , though he really did n't . Why would a brother leave a brother , or a friend leave a friend ? If he ever had a friend , he 'd never leave . Chopper nodded brusquely , the flesh of its thin , baggy neck wobbling from the weight of its huge head . `` Let 's not drag it out then . You 've been a challenge , Ben . Most kids , I can get them at least once . Not you . You were too good for me . Never let anything stick out , no matter what . '' Ben felt pride at Chopper 's praise . He quickly squashed it . Pride was one of the seven deadlies , everyone knew that . Chopper was watching him closely . It held out its long-fingered hand . The sharp edges of its teeth glittered as it smiled . `` I 'll miss you , Ben . '' Benjamin sat up , the covers falling to his waist . He looked at Chopper 's hand , then at the creature 's round , inscrutable face . Was it his imagination , or were its wide , oval eyes glistening with tears ? `` I 'll miss you too , Chopper , '' Benjamin said , trying to sound like a man . He took a deep breath and slowly , hesitantly , reached out to shake Chopper 's hand .
Eight years old , killed in the fire of his mind . Shown the way out , intangible and without substance , I couldn ’ t disperse as mist . Twelve and my corpse was creepy . Like a crisped piece of toast , all that was left was a tasty husk and a few peanut butter memories of better things , but they were replaced by better condiments like jelly . Fifteen and he had none . He had no one , I mean . Rotted zombie , reminded of battles lost , I had lost the greatest one . In one undeath , one word was said and what could have been a happy ending was n't anymore . The kid died at eighteen . He had no one left because I had strangled them all inside .
It 's funny what they call guardian angels these days . We 're now `` imaginary friends '' Well , we 've been called worse ; the imaginary bit is slightly silly , but we are indeed friends . At the very least , most of us . The only requirements to be a guardian are 1 . To be an angel and 2. to want this position . There is n't much competition -- you do n't even need to be sane . I mean , why choose to watch over another 's life if you can just apply to be reborn ? But I chose it . It was idyllic , at first . We would play in the alleys behind her run-down apartment , and with just a slight nudge from me , the trash piles rose to be beautiful sky scrapers and monsters . We would gawk and hide from the `` aliens '' of teenagers with intricate makeup and nouveaux hair . I loved watching her show me all her super princess power moves . But I could only watch when her uncle threw her on the bed and got on top of her . She started playing with me more . The skyscrapers became taller , more dangerous . And her princess powers became less glittery , and more hardened . Our activities changed too -- instead of helping and comforting the monsters of our world , we now sought to destroy them of their evil ways with our shining weapons . I told her I did n't want to play these new games , but she silenced me and we continued . What is growing up ? So many people explain it as finding a new self , but what does it entail ? Perhaps it 's just the realization that the world is not righteous and just and beautiful , but simply piles of trash . And some people might be able to ease into this knowledge gracefully , but not when you 're so young like she . This is why I do not blame her for raising her sword against mine . She had the most beautiful and tragic tears in her eyes , and I tried to remember them forever . `` You never helped me ! '' she screeched at me , and attacked . I parried most of her attacks -- it would n't do to make this small triumph of hers an empty victory -- but ever so slowly , the aliens melt away to just be regular teenagers , and our delicate world begins to go dim .
The light moves in unfamiliar patterns on the carpet now that the last of the furniture has been moved out , and bright sun coming through the curtainless window touches places that have been hidden for years . The dust motes and I don ’ t cast shadows substantial enough to mar the pristine landscape of freshly painted walls and steam cleaned carpets , but we linger as speckles dancing in eyes . I ’ ve been unmoored by the family ’ s move , but before that I had been banished to the small places in the house . My territory grew smaller with each passing year . The guest room closet where the child use to build fairy castles on long summer days . Some nights I lingered under the bathroom sink in the space where we use to hide . I also existed under the bed next to the stuffed unicorn . We ’ d lay in the dark and listen to the gentle breathing of the sleeper above and remember a time when we had a place beneath the sheets . I ’ d stare into the unicorn ’ s hard plastic eyes and whisper his name softly so neither of us would forget . There was no one left in the house to remember . The child had been gone for years . She left in inches as she grew . She swelled into a woman as her scent and body changed . She stopped seeing , but she remembered as she stared up at her old canopy bed . On the nights she regretted loosing me she ’ d pull the old stuff unicorn from under her bed and hug it to her chest with the intensity of the child she once was . And after the girl packed up her clothes and left , the mother still remembered me . Didn ’ t it seem like yesterday that her baby sat at that desk happily chattering to the air as she drew garish pictures with broken crayons ? An invisible eddy of air swirls and scatters me in the sunbeam . The summer days are long , but I and this finger of sunlight are old companions . The gentle Western light has moved over a crib , a bed and a bare floor . I know soon it will withdraw and unlike all the other nights in the past we will leave together .
I looked up . I heard you coming in . I waited impatiently on your soft bed as you walked in . Your smile faded when your eyes met mine and I cringed on the inside . But I could not let this feelings show . No , I had to be strong for you . Like I have always been , when those big , mean boys teased you about being a nerd , a nothing , a loser . But you are no loser and certainly not nothing , since you are standing right in front of me now . I ca n't just sit here any longer , so I jump up , run over to you . `` Can we play ? How was school ? Let 's go outside and play ! `` , I jump up and down excitedly . `` You silly old dog . We ca n't play '' , your voice sounds annoyed . But why ? You never called me dog , and for sure not silly ! Of course , I was a dog , a big dog , a good dog . Still , you never called me this . Never . `` What 's wrong ? Did those big bad boys make fun of you again ? When I get a hold of them , I will- '' - `` You will do nothing . And no they did n't . I am big now too , remember ? '' I look at you . Yes , you 've grown , sure . But a tree grows and it is still the same tree later on . Even if it becomes bigger , it 's not just another tree . I look at you confused . You roll your eyes . You never rolled your eyes at me , *ever* . Suddenly , I realise what 's up . This ca n't be , no . *No* . I flinch . `` Am I ... Am I a bad dog ? '' You look at me puzzled . Slowly , I back away . I failed you . Though I do n't know why , but I did something wrong . I can feel it . `` No , you 're not . Just ... I do n't have time to play with you anymore . I ... '' I sit down on the bed . What does that mean ? I feel a huge wave of sadness roll over me , swallowing me and pulling me into a deep , dark place . `` What ... ? '' I ca n't finish the question , my voice breaks . I am a terrible friend . There must be some mistake . `` Listen , you were a good friend . The best one I could possibly have while everyone made fun of me . I was a nothing , a loser . You were the only one making me feel better . But now , I am growing up , I am one of the *big guys* . Do n't you see that your fur is losing its color , that you are fading ? '' I looked down at myself . Really , my furwas getting grey , I was ... I was fading . I looked at you , the shock hit me like a fist . `` I 'm sorry , but this time had to come . Everything has to end eventually . I ca n't play with you anymore , I do n't *want* to . '' I felt as if a knive stabbed my stomach . `` But ... *No more playing ? * '' You sigh , sit down next to me . `` I 'm sorry , really . You are a wonderful friend , but it 's time to go . Are you ready ? '' I nod . You hug me , one last time . Tears roll down my face , as I am feeling how I get lighter , your touch fades away and I 'm gone .
I knew the it was coming . I guess I 've known it for awhile . The other friends in the break room said it would happen , but I did n't believe them . Not Jimmy , no he was different , he loved me . It looked like I was wrong though . I sat there on his bed , waiting for him to get home from school . The room was lit up from the sun shinning through the window , but everything seemed darker than ever . I hear a car door close , and look outside , he 's home . He 's different is n't he , I think to myself , hoping . Maybe if I believe in him , really believe , like he used to in me , then maybe he will be different from all the other friends ' kids . The door opens and Jimmy walks in . He looks over at his bed , looking for me , but I know he ca n't see me anymore . He whispers `` Max , you here ? '' . I calmly respond , `` Yeah , what 's up ? '' . His face changes to a look of despair , and I get the feeling that he was hoping for no answer instead . `` Wan na play space knights ? '' I ask , hoping he says yes , knowing he wo n't . Jimmy looks away , sets his bag next to his desk chair , and sits down , `` Not right now Max , maybe later '' . `` Oh , ok , yeah maybe later '' . We sit there in silence , him staring at his phone , me staring at him . He gets up from his chair , fiddling with his phone in his hands , `` Hey I got to go , I 'm going to hang out with the guys '' . `` Can I come , you do n't need to talk to me , i 'll just watch and listen to you guys '' . `` Not today '' . He starts walking towards his door . `` Maybe tomorrow '' I ask quietly . `` Yeah , we 'll see , maybe tomorrow '' . He turns his head a little so I can just make out his left eye . It looked a little wet , but I could n't be sure from on his bed . `` Bye Max '' . `` Bye Jimmy '' , and he walked out the door . I sat there for a couple of hours , just remembering the last 7 years . The day Jimmy would n't stop crying , then I showed up , and his eye 's dried up . All the times we watched tv together , or got dressed up and played space knights . I went through everything , every last memory , until there was just nothing . `` Bye Jimmy '' I said to the empty , dark room , but no response . Jimmy walked up the stairs , not sure of what was to come next . He opened his door slowly , set his bag down , and glanced over at the bed . `` Max , you here ? '' . He waited , but no response . He sighed , sat down on his bed , and remembered . He remembered Space Knights , and Saturday morning tv . He remembered Max being there for him , when he had a bad day . He too , remembered it all . `` Thanks Max , for everything '' . I get a call , it 's short , but I guess I needed to hear it . I 've been reassigned . A new place opens up before my eyes . A boy , maybe around 4 is laying face down on his bed . `` Hi , I 'm Max '' .
She 's panicking . I 've seen it before , when she 'd take me to school with her . She would show me to her friends , back when all you needed for friends was to be stuck in the same room for awhile , and maybe some imagination . Before the kids learned to hate themselves , and take it out on each other . I do n't have to look at what 's on her test to know what it is . Math used to make her anxious . Snapping pencils and sobbing into worksheets . Of course it did n't help that her teachers made fun of her for it , along with the speech impediment . `` Obviouswy you should wearn to talk like a gwown-up . '' That one had shut her up for years . She used to talk so much , have so many ideas , but that was before they 'd learned to be afraid , before they kids learned to draw into themselves and shut out the world and think that it did n't understand . I understand , or used to . She 'd tell me about it , swinging her sabre to and fro as we traversed the Malakarian Wastes as though slashing at enemies that did not exist in our world . She ranted a lot , angry , sometimes wearing her voice out in pure outrage , sapping her energy so quickly that sometimes we had to leave before making any progress toward our goal , but she needed it . God knows she was n't getting enough of it elsewhere . She was n't getting it behind daycare gates , and certainly was n't in the desks that bleached her colourless and made her mute . I never knew what it was about school that did that . Now she needs more than imagination to make friends . Imagination , she says , actually makes it harder to make friends . They think you 're strange if you talk too lofty . A freak . I was willing to leave . Anything to help her - anything to put color back in her voice and her eyes , anything to bring back the smiling girl I had known . But still she spoke to me , even though I knew from the way her eyes flickered that she could n't see me anymore . I do n't even know if she can hear me anymore . I like to think she can - after all , she did put the pills back , that night when I caught her with them , staring . Too old for me , but far too young for that . And now she 's panicking . I weave through the gymnasium . None of the kids notice me ; some of them used to be able to , but not a single one so much as glances up , even as the draft from my passage makes their tests flutter . Spring . The SATs . The terror in the room is tangible . It 's imaginary numbers instead of imaginary friends . A math test . Grades are love , grades are life . Maybe if she gets good grades her mother will finally be happy with her , even though her mother is never happy . She looks like she 's going to start snapping pencils , waving a sabre around at enemies that are n't there . But the pen 's her sabre now - she 's just forgotten how to use it . She might be about to cry . She looks like she did the night with the pills , the day the teacher made fun of her in front of forty of her peers , the day her best friend called her a baby and sold out all her secrets to the gossipy kids . She 's about to give up . It 's just a math test , kid . It 's okay . I stare over her shoulder . I need to help her . I ca n't lift a sword against this enemy , ca n't hold off the dragon . I can not alert her to the oncoming storm , the incoming army . It 's imaginary numbers . There is no help here . I reach out and touch her on the shoulder . Her test flutters . `` Hey , kid , '' I say . She ca n't hear me . `` Do n't panic . '' And , very slowly , I feel her relax . The tears dry from her eyes . With a deep breath , she closes her eyes , and starts again on her test . For a long moment , we remain there , an invisible shapeshifting shadow and a seventeen-year-old who never quite let me go . And for once , I 'm glad she did n't .
I forced down the rage that threatened to boil over as I locked eyes with my host . This would likely be his last memory of me as I faded from his sight . He had n't been able to hear me for days , indicating that my time drawing strength from him was ending . 14 years . I have n't lasted 14 years with a human since the days of our fall . Despite the anger of failure , this was a victory of sorts . 2 years short of maturity . As the old ways fade , my kind draws closer to this reality . For Millennia , we roamed the world with the puny humans as our play things . I 've seen they call us `` super-nats '' and mythical creatures now . We were the things of Dreams . Of Legends . Of Nightmares . The wizards and sorcerers could barely defend themselves from us , let alone their people . Thinking ourselves invincible , we were complacent in our power , the eternity of our rule . We did n't understand what they did until far too late . Imaginary , we were called . It inspired Hope , fear , wonder , and terror . The wizards destroyed our name . They opened their schools , and taught that Imaginary means not real ! Imaginary means that something is make believe , that it does n't exist . We laughed at them . Not exist ? Preposterous . The human population began to swell . We were always loners , and it was n't till the end that those of us remaining figured it out . They had killed our gateway into this plane . Our kind must bond with an infant and siphon power from their belief until they reach maturity after 16 revolutions of their sun . If that belief is cut off , we lose our gateway and must start over . For centuries now , people have been taught we do n't exist . Taught that their spirit companion is n't real , they cut us off from their world again and again . In the face of all the stories and evidence and history of our existence , we ca n't reenter their world . It ’ s maddening ! The 21st century brings new hope , however . People want to believe . Their TV shows , movies , books , and video games all speak of us . The humans are enchanted . They do n't see that it will be their doom . They dream of our reality , and once we get a foothold , you can be sure that the past will not repeat itself . We will crush them and make sure that they can not deny our existence . We will be back , for we are patient . We are eternal . We are Imaginary .
They say that purgatory does n't exist , but they 're wrong , they 're dead wrong and do n't you let a damn soul tell you otherwise . Forgive me , cussing is this nasty habit I 've fallen into . But it is n't becoming of someone like me . Why if Abby were here she 'd tell me ... But the truth is she has n't been here , not for sixteen years . They say that she should be having kids about now . Likely by the time her child takes its first breath , I shall be gone . Even this void is not as permanent as the one that awaits me . I 've seen the others , simply swallowed up by nothing , they evaporate in the air going God knows where . Unless we 're summoned one last time , in which case a portal opens , bring us back to our home . That 's not likely for me , but I accept my fate . I suppose if we were n't kept here and annihilated the would would be overrun with creatures like us . It 's only fair , all things must come to an end , even those things that never really were to begin .
I remember when you first called to me ... I remember running through the summer grass and laughing ... I remember sitting by your bed , staying awake all night so you could sleep ... no longer afraid of the monsters in your closet . But ... It 's getting harder and harder ... The soft glow of a computer screen stands vigil by your bed at night , and it gets harder ... I remember ... or do i ? ... Did we play in the park in the summer sun ? or was that a dream from long ago ? ... I gave up calling your name ... You do n't seem to listen anymore ... But there is a moment ... my favourite moment each night ... Just before you fall asleep , before you dream ; a moment where magic still exists . And just in that moment I 'm yours and you are mine once more . You whisper my name and i take your hand and hold it ... It 's funny i 've never been tired before ... Never felt the need to sleep ... I walk over to your chair and sit in it watching you with heavy eyes ... I remember ... but it 's going , i ca n't recall my name ... or yours ... or where we played ... but in that moment before i close my eyes and dream ... in that moment where magic still exists i see your face ... And i remember
The sun was setting on the horizon , its orange rays casting a warm glow over the city . People were hurrying home , their shadows stretching out in the fading light . Cars drove by , their headlights piercing the dusk . A cool breeze blew , rustling the leaves of the trees . Birds flew overhead , their chirps echoing in the air . The sky was a deep blue , the stars beginning to twinkle . In the distance , a church bell tolled , its sound carrying through the night . A dog barked , its tail wagging in excitement . The night was peaceful , the world at rest . All was still , the silence broken only by the sound of crickets . The moon rose , its silver light bathing the land . The night was beautiful , its beauty unrivaled . Peace .
Prologue . The sun was setting over the horizon , casting a brilliant orange glow across the sky . The air was still and quiet , the only sound coming from the gentle rustling of the trees in the nearby forest . It was a peaceful evening , and yet something felt off . There was a tension in the air , a feeling of anticipation that seemed to hang over the land . Suddenly , a loud crash echoed through the air , followed by a deep rumbling that shook the ground beneath their feet . The sky lit up with a brilliant flash of light , and a figure appeared in the sky . The figure was a woman , her long white hair billowing in the wind . She wore a long white dress that seemed to shimmer in the light , and her eyes were a deep blue that seemed to pierce through the darkness . She hovered in the sky , her gaze sweeping across the land below . She seemed to be searching for something , and then her eyes settled on a small village in the distance . The woman descended from the sky , her feet touching the ground with a gentle thud . She walked towards the village , her steps slow and deliberate . As she approached , the villagers gathered around her , their eyes wide with fear and awe . The woman spoke , her voice soft and melodic . `` I am here to bring you a message , '' she said . `` A message of hope and of change . A message that will shape the future of this land , and of all who inhabit it . '' The villagers listened in silence , their eyes wide with wonder . `` The time has come , '' the woman continued . `` The time for a new beginning . A time for a new era . A time for heroes to rise . '' The woman paused , her gaze sweeping across the crowd . `` Are you ready ? '' she asked . The villagers nodded , their faces filled with determination . `` Then let us begin , '' the woman said . And with that , the adventure began .
You stand there , looking at your own reflection , and you feel a wave of guilt and regret wash over you . You realize that you have hurt yourself the most in life , and that you have to forgive yourself before you can move on . You take a deep breath and close your eyes , and you start to forgive yourself for all the mistakes you have made . You start to accept that you are not perfect , and that you have done the best you can with the resources you have . You start to feel a sense of peace and understanding , and you know that you are ready to move on .

I won the championship last year by coming up with a plan that was both creative and difficult . My plan was to travel back in time to the early 1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power . I then infiltrated his inner circle and slowly gained his trust . Once I had gained his trust , I began to subtly influence his decisions , steering him away from the path of war and destruction . I used my knowledge of history to guide him towards more peaceful solutions to the problems he faced . Eventually , I had managed to steer Hitler away from the path of war and destruction , and he was on the brink of becoming a peaceful leader . At this point , I revealed my true identity and purpose to him . I told him that I was a time traveler from the future , and that I had come to prevent the horrors of World War II . Hitler was shocked and confused , but he eventually agreed to my plan . He agreed to step down from power and allow a peaceful transition of power to take place . My plan worked , and I was able to prevent World War II from ever happening . I was declared the champion of the time traveler 's competition , and my name will go down in history as the one who prevented the horrors of World War II .

'' The old woman went on to tell Lila that she was the guardian of the magical cave and the golden apple was a gift to her for finding it . She said that the apple held the power to grant wishes and that Lila could use it to make her dreams come true . Lila thanked the old woman for her kindness and left the cottage with the golden apple in hand . She returned home with a newfound sense of hope and possibility . From that day forward , Lila used the power of the golden apple to make her dreams come true . She explored the world , made new friends , and experienced a life full of adventure . The End .
I won the championship last year by taking a very creative and difficult approach . I decided to go back to the year 1933 and find a way to stop Hitler from ever coming to power . I knew that I had to be careful and not do anything that would drastically alter the timeline , so I decided to use subtle methods . First , I visited the offices of the Nazi party and spread rumors that Hitler was a fraud and a con artist . I also spread rumors that he was a coward and a weak leader . I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the party , so that they would spread it to the rest of the party . Next , I visited the offices of the German President , Paul von Hindenburg , and spread rumors that Hitler was a dangerous and unstable man who should not be trusted with power . I also made sure to spread these rumors to influential people in the government , so that they would spread it to the rest of the government . Finally , I visited the homes of important people in the Nazi party and government and planted evidence that Hitler was a fraud and a con artist .

I won last year 's championship by taking a very creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . Instead of trying to physically assassinate him , I decided to travel back in time and subtly manipulate his life so that he would never rise to power . I started by traveling back to when Hitler was a young adult and living in Vienna . I befriended him and started to subtly influence his decisions . I encouraged him to pursue his artistic aspirations instead of joining the military . I also persuaded him to move to Munich so that he would be away from the political turmoil in Vienna . After that , I traveled back to the beginning of World War I and convinced Hitler to enlist in the Austrian army instead of the German army . By doing this , I ensured that he would be away from the front lines and would not be able to gain any political power . Finally , I traveled back to the early 1920s and convinced Hitler to join the Nazi party . I made sure to discourage him from taking any leadership positions in the party and instead encouraged him to focus on his artwork . By the time I was finished , Hitler was nothing more than a struggling artist with no political ambitions . I had successfully killed Hitler without ever firing a single shot .

My winning strategy was a combination of creativity and difficulty . I started by traveling back in time to the mid-1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power in Germany . I knew that if I could disrupt his plans early on , it would have a ripple effect that would prevent him from ever coming to power . So , I decided to approach the problem from a different angle . Rather than try to kill Hitler directly , I opted to use my knowledge of the future to subtly influence events and people around him , making it more difficult for him to achieve his goals . I started by subtly influencing people in Hitler ’ s inner circle , making sure they were less likely to support him or follow his orders . I also made sure to spread rumors and misinformation about Hitler ’ s plans , making it more difficult for him to gain public support . I also made sure to sabotage some of his plans by subtly influencing key figures in the German government and military . I used my knowledge of the future to make sure that key decisions were made against Hitler ’ s wishes , and that his plans were more difficult to carry out . Finally , I made sure to spread rumors about Hitler ’ s plans to invade other countries , making it more difficult for him to gain the support of the German people . By combining all of these tactics , I was able to effectively disrupt Hitler ’ s plans and prevent him from ever coming to power . By winning the competition , I not only earned points for creativity and difficulty , but I also made sure that history will never have to repeat itself .

Prologue . The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Springdale , casting long shadows over the streets and buildings . The air was still and the sky was a brilliant shade of orange . It was the kind of evening that made people pause and take in the beauty of the world around them . It was also the kind of evening that made people feel small and insignificant . For one person in particular , it was a night that changed everything . The man was walking down the street , hands in his pockets , lost in thought . He had no destination in mind , no agenda , no plan . He was just walking , letting his feet take him wherever they wanted to go . He stopped in front of a small park and looked around . A few people were sitting on the benches , enjoying the last bit of daylight . He smiled and continued on his way . As he walked , he noticed a small alley between two buildings . He hesitated for a moment , unsure if he should take the risk . Curiosity got the better of him and he stepped into the shadows . The alley was dark and narrow , and it smelled of urine and rotting garbage . He could hear the faint sound of a woman crying in the distance . He moved closer , his heart pounding in his chest . Suddenly , a figure stepped out of the shadows . It was a woman , her face hidden in the darkness . He froze , unable to move . The woman looked at him for a long moment before she finally spoke . `` Do you want to hear a story ? '' The man nodded , not quite sure what to expect . The woman began to tell him a story about a world far away , a world of magic and adventure . She spoke of brave heroes and powerful villains , of dragons and wizards and mysterious creatures . As she spoke , the man felt his heart swell with hope . He felt like he could do anything , be anything . When she finished her tale , the man thanked her and stepped back out into the street . He felt like he had just been given a gift , a chance to start over and make something of his life . He was no longer the same man that had stepped into the alley just a few moments ago . He was a hero .
The old man walked slowly along the beach , the sun setting behind him . His memories of the day drifting away , like the seagulls that flew above . His feet shuffled in the sand , his stick tapping with each step . He thought of all the years that had passed , of the moments that had gone . He remembered his lost love , the one he could never forget . He looked out to the sea and sighed , the shoreline fading away . He whispered her name one last time , as he slowly closed his eyes . Goodbye .
It had been a long time since the world had changed . People with extraordinary powers had started to appear , and they were quickly classified according to their power . The most powerful of them all was me , but no one knew what my power was . I had been living in the city for a while now , and I had made quite a name for myself . Everyone knew my name , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret , and I was content to stay at the top of the power rankings . My life was pretty good , but I knew that I could never let my guard down . People had been known to kill those of higher rank in order to try and obtain their rank . I was constantly on the lookout for any signs of danger , but I was never able to detect any . My life continued like this for many years , until one day I was approached by a mysterious stranger . He told me that he knew what my power was and he wanted to help me unlock it . I was skeptical , but his offer was too tempting to refuse . He took me to a secret underground lab and showed me a device that he said could unlock my power . I was hesitant , but I decided to give it a try . As soon as I put it on , I felt a surge of energy run through my body . I could feel my power manifesting , and I could finally control it . The stranger revealed that my power was electro-kinesis , and I had the ability to manipulate electricity . I was elated , and I finally felt like I had control over my life . I thanked the stranger for his help and went on my way , feeling more powerful than ever before . From that day forward , I used my power to protect those weaker than me , and to keep myself at the top of the power rankings . No one dared to challenge me , for they knew that I was the most powerful of them all .
I won last year 's Time Traveler Killing Hitler competition by traveling back to the year 1945 and posing as an Italian soldier in the Wehrmacht . I managed to infiltrate Hitler 's inner circle and gain his trust by playing on his fear of betrayal . Once I had gained his trust , I poisoned Hitler 's food and drink with a slow-acting toxin that allowed me to escape without suspicion . As Hitler 's health declined , I was able to move freely throughout the bunker , eventually making my way to the Fuhrerbunker itself . Once inside , I planted several explosives around the bunker 's walls and detonated them , ensuring that Hitler and his inner circle could not escape . I then made my escape back to my own time , victorious in my mission .
I won the championship last year by coming up with a strategy that was both creative and difficult . I traveled back in time to just before the beginning of World War II . Knowing that Hitler was in Munich at the time , I went there and posed as a messenger delivering a package to the Nazi leader . Once I was inside his office , I quickly revealed my true identity and presented him with a gift – an old book of poetry . As he opened it , I had already planted a deadly bomb inside . Before he could even react , the bomb exploded and Hitler was killed instantly . I was able to escape before the guards could apprehend me , and the rest is history . My quick thinking and creativity had earned me the championship , and I was the first time traveler to ever successfully kill Hitler .

I was free and happy . Thank you to the person who donated their happiness to me . You changed my life and I will be forever grateful .
The sun shone brightly on the morning of June 8th , 2047 . For the first time in a long time , the world felt like it had been given a fresh start . After the War of the Nations , the world had become a much different place . Technology had advanced greatly , and the way people lived their lives had changed drastically . The world was no longer divided into nations , instead it was now made up of small self-governing communities . People were free to travel between these communities as they wished . This had brought about a new era of peace and prosperity . However , there were still some who sought to take advantage of this newfound peace and freedom . There were those who would resort to any means necessary to gain power and wealth . These were the people who caused fear and chaos in the hearts of the people . It was with these thoughts in mind that I , David Smith , set out on a mission to bring justice to those who sought to take advantage of the new world order . I was an experienced soldier and I was determined to make sure that the world stayed safe and prosperous . I left my home in the small town of Cambridge , England , and travelled to London . I had heard rumors of a powerful criminal organization operating in the city , and I was determined to take them down . Little did I know that this mission would change my life forever .
I had lived in this city my entire life and seen people with powers all around me . I had seen people with telekinesis , electrokinesis , and even some with sensors . I had even seen people with more than one power , although that was rare . Everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were , and I was the highest . Everyone knew I was the strongest , but no one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret because I knew if anyone found out what my power was , they would come after me . I had seen people kill each other for the chance to take someone else ’ s rank , and I didn ’ t want to be the next victim . I had to be careful and keep my power hidden . I had friends in the city , but I never told them my secret . I was content to stay in the shadows , but then something changed . Someone started to threaten me , saying that they knew what my power was and that they were going to use it against me . I had to find out who this person was and stop them before they revealed my power and put me in danger . I started asking around and eventually tracked down the person who had been threatening me . It turned out that it was someone I had gone to school with , a girl who had always been jealous of me and my rank . She had figured out my power and wanted to use it to take my rank and become the most powerful person in the city . I confronted her and told her that I would never let her take my rank . She didn ’ t believe me and said that I was too weak to stop her . I smiled and said that she was wrong , and then I revealed my power . I had the power of transformation . I could transform into any animal or object I wanted , and I used this power to defeat her . She was shocked and couldn ’ t believe that I had such a powerful ability . I told her that I would always be the strongest in the city , and she had to accept that . She eventually conceded , and I kept my rank as the most powerful person in the city . I kept my power a secret from everyone , and I vowed to use it only for good . I knew that if I ever used it for evil , I would become just like the people I had seen fight for rank .
First Paragraph : I was standing in the middle of a vast desert , my clothes sticking to my body from the oppressive heat . The sand was so hot that I could feel it through the soles of my shoes . I had no idea how I had gotten here , or where I was even going . All I knew was that I had to keep walking . Last Paragraph : After what felt like hours , I finally saw something in the distance . As I got closer , I realized it was a small town . I had no idea if it would be safe , or even if I would be welcome . Taking a deep breath , I stepped closer , ready to find out what awaited me .
At first , I was confused by the feeling that came over me . It felt like a warmth that settled in my chest , radiating out to my limbs . I felt a lightness , like I could suddenly move through the world with a newfound energy . I smiled and laughed , my tears of sadness replaced by tears of joy . The feeling of happiness was foreign to me , but I embraced it nonetheless . I realized that it was the emotion that I had been missing all these years . I savored the feeling , letting it fill me up and transform me . I was no longer a stranger to joy . As I continued to accept donations of emotions , I found myself becoming more and more aware of the feelings of others . I began to understand their stories , their sadness and their joy . I could empathize with them and offer my support . I realized that emotion was a part of life , and that it was something to be cherished . I had been granted the gift of understanding , and I was determined to share it with the world .
I won last year 's time travel competition by coming up with the most creative and difficult plan for killing Hitler . My plan was to send him a letter from the future , warning him of his impending death . The letter was written by a mysterious time traveler from the future , who claimed to have come back to warn Hitler of his impending death . The letter warned him that he had only a few days to live , and that he should take the necessary precautions to prepare for his own demise . The letter was sent to Hitler 's personal residence , and was delivered by a trusted messenger . It gave Hitler the perfect opportunity to flee or take the necessary precautions to protect himself . However , he chose to ignore the warning , thinking it was a hoax . Unfortunately for Hitler , the letter was not a hoax . Three days after receiving it , Hitler was killed in a surprise attack on his bunker . He was caught completely off-guard , and unable to take the necessary steps to protect himself . My plan ended up being the most creative and difficult way to kill Hitler , and I was awarded the championship for my ingenuity .

I was the most powerful of us all , but no one knew what my power was . I was rank number one , but I kept my ability a closely guarded secret , as I was afraid of what would happen if my power was revealed .

I knew that if anyone discovered my power , I would be in grave danger . I had to stay vigilant , and never allow my guard to drop .

It 's hard to say goodbye to a friend , but it 's important to remember that all things must come to an end . As your friend grows up and their needs and imaginations change , it 's only natural that you must fade away . Although you may no longer be a part of their life , the memories and adventures you shared will always remain in their hearts . They may not need you anymore , but your impact on their lives will never be forgotten . Take comfort in the knowledge that they are still the same person you once knew and that your friendship , though fleeting , was special and meaningful . As you leave , remember to be proud of the impact you made in your friend 's life and the special place you had in their hearts .
I won the time travel championship last year by using some out-of-the-box thinking . Instead of simply traveling back in time and killing Hitler in the most direct way possible , I decided to get creative . First , I traveled back to the 1920s , when Hitler was just beginning to gain power in Germany . I used my knowledge of history and political science to help ensure that Hitler would never rise to power in the first place . I forged documents , wrote fake news articles , and even influenced key players in the Nazi party to discredit Hitler 's ideas . Once I was sure that Hitler would never gain power , I traveled back to the 1940s and eliminated all traces of his existence . I destroyed any documents or records that showed his name , or even hinted at his existence . I made sure that no one would ever know that Hitler had ever lived . By taking a more creative and indirect approach to killing Hitler , I was able to win the time travel championship . I 'm proud of my accomplishment and I 'm looking forward to defending my title this year .

In a small town tucked away in the hills of New England , there lived a young boy named Mark . He was an only child , living with his parents in a modest house near the edge of town . Mark was a curious boy with a great love of learning and adventure . Mark had been taught from a young age to never go into the forest that bordered his home .

Last year , I won the time-traveler 's championship by successfully killing Hitler in the most creative and difficult way possible . I decided to go back in time and become Hitler 's barber . Knowing his routine , I would begin cutting his hair and then , when he was least expecting it , I 'd pull out a gun and shoot him . The interesting part was that I had to arrange the entire situation to make sure that I was in the right place at the right time while also making sure that nobody else noticed what I was doing . To do this , I had to get Hitler to come to a private barbershop when it was completely empty . I waited for weeks for the perfect opportunity , and eventually it came . I made sure that the barbershop was empty and that Hitler was alone . Then , I went in and started to cut his hair . As I finished , I pulled out the gun , shot him , and made sure to get away quickly . In the end , it was a success . I had killed Hitler in the most creative and difficult way possible and won the time-traveler 's championship .
I won the championship last year by using a combination of ingenuity and daring . It all started when I travelled back to 1942 and located Hitler in his bunker . I then devised a plan that involved a series of stratagems . First , I used a mind-control device to temporarily take control of one of his key advisors . I then convinced the advisor to present a false set of orders to Hitler directing him to move to a distant location to attend a secret meeting . Second , I infiltrated the bunker by disguising myself as a member of the SS , and managed to get close enough to Hitler to deliver a fatal dose of poison to him . As the poison took effect , I made my escape from the bunker . Finally , in my escape , I had to contend with an elite group of Nazi bodyguards . I used a number of ingenious tactics to slow them down and make my escape , including setting fire to several oil barrels and setting off a series of explosions . In the end , I emerged triumphant , having completed my mission and escaped without a trace . My success in this daring mission earned me the title of last year ’ s champion among time travelers .

You realize that you have to make amends for your mistakes and you have to forgive yourself . You must be willing to change for the better and accept responsibility for your actions . You also must try to right any wrongs that you have caused . After all of this , you will find the peace and comfort you seek in Heaven .
At first , I did n't know what to do with the feeling of happiness . It seemed strange and foreign , yet I wanted to explore it . I began to look for ways to feel it more and soon realized that being kind to others and helping them , brought me a sense of fulfillment that I had never felt before . I began to give back , volunteering at local charities , visiting nursing homes to bring joy to the elderly , and even helping out at a soup kitchen . Through this experience , I learned the importance of giving and how much it could bring me . I also learned that happiness could be found in the simplest of moments and that I did n't need to rely on other people 's emotions to feel joy . I found that I could create my own happiness and that it was something that I could cultivate within myself . I realized that emotions are powerful , and that I could use them to make a positive difference in the world .
I won the time travel competition for killing Hitler last year by coming up with a creative and difficult plan . I started by going back to 1923 , before Hitler rose to power . I knew that I had to be careful not to alter the timeline , so I followed him around , studying his every move , without engaging him . One day , Hitler was addressing a crowd in Munich and I noticed a small opening at the back of the stage . I quickly formulated a plan . I waited until Hitler was in mid-speech , then I snuck up behind him and fired an air rifle loaded with a cyanide dart right into his neck . The crowd gasped as Hitler dropped to the ground , dead . The authorities were quickly called in and they declared that it was an assassination . I slipped away in the confusion and returned to my own time . I won the competition by successfully killing Hitler without altering the timeline . It was a risky move , but it paid off in the end .

You can now enter Heaven knowing that you have forgiven yourself .
The city was a strange place ; it seemed to be an amalgamation of science fiction and fantasy . I had grown up in the city , but I had never seen anything like it before . Everyone had some kind of power ; some could move objects with their minds , others could manipulate electricity , and still others had heightened senses . What made this place so unique was its ranking system ; it was based on the strength of one 's abilities . I was the number one ranked , but no one knew what my power was . I had lived in the city all my life , but I had kept my power a secret . I had seen what happened to those who revealed their abilities ; they were hunted down and killed by others higher up the rankings wanting to gain some of their power . I had the highest rank , but I knew that would soon change if I revealed my power . My power was something that I had kept hidden for years , and I was determined to keep it that way . I had the ability to control people . I could make them do whatever I wanted , as long as I kept within a certain range . It was a powerful ability , and a dangerous one too . I had seen people use their powers to kill someone of a higher ranking and take their power , so I knew what was at stake . One day , I was walking through the city when I noticed a group of people following me . I quickly realized that they were the same group of people who had wanted to take my power . I did n't know what to do ; I was sure that I could n't fight them all off . Then , I realized that I had an ace up my sleeve . I stopped and turned around , facing the group . I closed my eyes and concentrated , and soon I could feel the power of my abilities taking over . I opened my eyes , and the group of people had stopped in their tracks , looking scared and confused . I had used my power to control them . I knew that they would never be able to take my rank if I had this ability . I continued to use my power to control the group and I eventually managed to get them to back off . I had discovered my power , and I had saved myself from a potentially dangerous situation . From then on , I was more careful about revealing my power , and I kept it a secret from everyone else . This city was full of people with powers , and I was at the top of

As last year 's champion of the time traveling Killing Hitler sport , I 'm here to tell you the story of how I won . My strategy was simple : I just had to be creative and think of a way that would completely surprise everyone . I had to come up with something no one had ever seen or done before . So , I decided to travel back to 1945 and to the night the Nazis were celebrating Hitler 's 56th birthday . I made sure to bring along a few items that would be useful . First , I brought a large cake , decorated with a portrait of Hitler 's face . I also brought a few bottles of wine , some candles , and a couple of Nazi flags . When I arrived at the celebration , I made sure to blend in with the crowd . I waited for my moment and then I revealed my plan . I lit the candles , raised a Nazi flag , and started singing `` Happy Birthday '' to Hitler . At first , everyone was confused . But when I brought out the cake , they started to catch on . I lit the cake with the candles , and when it exploded , it revealed a robotic Hitler doll . The doll was rigged with explosives , and when it detonated , everyone at the party was killed instantly . I had won the Killing Hitler sport ! I shocked everyone in attendance with my creativity and ingenuity . The crowd roared in applause and I was declared the champion .

I won last year 's `` Killing Hitler '' competition with an ingenious plan that was both creative and difficult . I traveled back in time to just after the infamous Beer Hall Putsch , when Hitler was in prison . I knew that if I could get to him in his cell , I could take him out without the risk of being caught or tracked . So I posed as a guard and gained access to the prison . I then made my way to Hitler 's cell and , using a poisoned dart , quickly and quietly took him out . This was a risky move and I knew that if I was caught I would be in serious trouble , but I managed to make it out of the prison and back to my own time before anyone noticed what had happened . My plan worked and it earned me the title of champion and a huge number of points . Killing Hitler may be a game , but it 's also a serious mission that requires careful planning and execution . I 'm proud to have been the one who succeeded .
Last year , I won the time travel tournament by showing the most creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . My plan was to send one of his closest confidantes , Rudolf Hess , back in time to warn Hitler of his impending demise . As Hess 's loyalty to Hitler was unquestioned , I calculated that this would put Hitler into a paranoid state , resulting in him taking drastic measures to avoid his own death . My plan worked perfectly . Hitler ordered Hess to cut off contact with all his friends and associates , and to even change his name . As a result , Hitler became increasingly isolated , and was unable to rely on anyone for his protection . This meant that when I finally made my move , it would n't take much effort to take him out . I traveled back to 1945 and , armed with a silenced pistol , I found Hitler in his bunker . As I raised my gun , Hitler 's eyes widened with fear as he realized his fate . I pulled the trigger and his body slumped to the floor . After Hitler was dead , I quickly departed the bunker , leaving a stunned and silent crowd behind me . My creative approach to killing Hitler resulted in me becoming the last year 's champion in the time travel tournament . It was a feat that most deemed impossible , but I proved them wrong .
I won the title of last year 's time travel champion by completing the most creative and difficult mission : killing Hitler . I stepped back in time to November 9 , 1938 , the day before Hitler ’ s fateful speech to the Nazi Party in Munich . My plan was to intercept Hitler as he made his way to the event . I identified a weak spot in the security detail and used it to my advantage . I sneaked in a small explosive device that I had crafted and activated it near Hitler 's podium right before the speech . The explosion was loud enough to startle the crowd , and when people looked up , they saw me with my gun pointed at Hitler . I quickly shot him twice in the head , killing him on the spot . He did not have time to react , and his men took off running as soon as they realized what was going on . The deed was done , and I was able to quickly flicker away to my own time . I had won the title of `` Time Travel Champion '' for killing Hitler with style and creativity .
It had been this way for as long as I can remember . In this city , every person had their own special power , whether it was telekinesis , electrokinesis , or even the ability to 'sense ' things . As a result , these powers became a way to rank people within the city . Everyone had their own rank , and I was number one . No one knew what my power was , not even myself . I had never been able to unlock it . But this fact made me the most feared person of all . It was said that with my power I could bring down the whole city with a single thought . But that wasn ’ t the end of it . Rumors had spread that anyone who could kill me could take my place as number one . People had been trying to find a way to take out the number one spot for years now , searching for any weakness or vulnerability that I might have . But I knew that I could never be taken down . I had worked for years to make sure that my power stayed hidden , and I had become a master of my secrets . If someone wanted to take my spot , they were going to have to work hard to even stand a chance . In the end , no one ever did . To this day , I remain the number one of the city , and no one has been able to take my place . My power still remains a mystery , but I ’ m content with that . As long as no one knows what my power is , they ’ ll never be able to take me down .
My victory was a long time in the making . I had spent many months researching the most difficult and creative ways to kill Hitler . I experimented with various methods , such as poisoning , sabotaging his communication systems , and even hiring assassins . Finally , I decided on an ingenious plan . I traveled back to 1939 and disguised myself as an SS officer . I gained access to Hitler ’ s residence and with the help of some explosives , I blew the entire building up . My plan worked perfectly and Hitler died in the explosion . I was awarded the highest number of points for creativity and difficulty . I was declared the champion time traveler for killing Hitler in such an innovative way . It was a great feeling of accomplishment and I was thrilled to have won !

Last year 's competition for `` Killing Hitler '' was one of the most challenging and intense yet . I needed to come up with a creative and difficult way of executing the infamous figure without initiating a global war or disrupting the timelines . After some careful planning and consideration , I settled on a plan that , though subtle , had a major impact . My plan was to travel to the year 1944 , when Hitler was living in his Wolf 's Lair headquarters . My first task was to sneak into the compound , which I accomplished using a clever disguise and some old-fashioned infiltration . Once I was inside , I made my way to Hitler 's personal quarters , where I hid myself in a cupboard . From my hiding place , I was able to observe Hitler 's daily routine . After a couple of days , I noticed he had a habit of taking a glass of water before he retired to bed . I quickly devised a plan to take advantage of this routine . On the night of the competition , I waited until Hitler had gone to sleep and then I made my move . I snuck out of the cupboard and replaced his glass of water with a glass of poisoned water . Knowing Hitler 's penchant for a good night 's sleep , I was sure he would drink the water and succumb to the poison before morning . My plan worked flawlessly and the next morning Hitler was dead . I won the competition and was hailed as the champion , having accomplished what nobody else could . With my ingenious and daring plan , I had changed the course of history and won the ultimate prize .
The sun was shining brightly , birds singing in the trees . Clouds drifted high in the sky , the wind rustling gently . But beneath the calm of nature , a storm was brewing deep . Fear crept into hearts of all , no one daring to speak . The whispers grew in intensity , rumors shifting the mood . Trembling hands clutched at hope , fear gripping like a noose . The sound of drumming hooves grew louder , drawing ever closer . Torchlight glinted in the dark , an army marched in anger . Panic rose , despair followed , air clogged with cries of dread . All eyes gazed upon the king , what fate would he decree ? With a single word , he declared , `` Retreat ! ''
Once upon a time there was a city full of people with supernatural powers . Each person had a rank , reflecting their level of power , and the highest ranking individual was said to be the most powerful . For years , the city ’ s citizens had lived in relative peace , each person content with their station in life . But all that changed when a mysterious stranger arrived in the city . No one knew who he was , only that he was incredibly powerful , strong enough to challenge even the most powerful members of the city . He moved through the city like a ghost , seemingly unseen by all . Yet , many people sensed his presence and they knew that he was the highest-ranking individual in the city . The stranger never revealed his true identity , or the source of his power , but rumours began to spread that he had the power to kill anyone he pleased and thus take their rank as the most powerful individual in the city . It seemed that anyone who challenged him was never seen again . Despite the mystery surrounding the stranger , no one dared to challenge him . People were too scared of his power , and they began to refer to him as “ The Unseen ” . That was until one day , when an old man appeared in the city . He was a wise elder , known to the city ’ s inhabitants , and he had come to bring news . He told the people that the stranger was none other than the city ’ s long-lost hero , the one who was said to possess a power that surpassed all others . The Unseen had finally revealed himself , and all could see that he was the most powerful person in the city . Everyone was in awe of the stranger 's power , and no one dared to challenge him again . Little did anyone know , however , that the Unseen was actually you . You had been hiding your true power for so long , and had come to the city in search of a battle worthy of your strength . Now , you had finally found it , and you were the undisputed ruler of the city .
My victory this year was a difficult one . After months of strategizing , I finally developed a plan that would take me to a point in time just before Hitler was to give a speech . I slowly made my way towards the speech stage , slowly and carefully , evading detection . I made it to the stage just as Hitler was making his way to the podium . I had to act fast , so I took out my trusty time-traveling device and set it to just before the moment Hitler began to speak . Then I leapt forward in time , just moments before Hitler began to speak . As he was about to begin , I shouted out `` HEIL HITLER ! '' and pulled out a gun , aiming it squarely at his chest . I waited for the shock on his face , and when it came , I pulled the trigger . The entire audience gasped and I heard cries of horror in the crowd , but my mission had been accomplished . I had killed Hitler , and in doing so had won the time-traveling championship . Now , all I had to do was make sure I had enough time to get back to my own time unharmed . With the mission complete , I retreated back to the future , mission accomplished .

They had been married for a decade when their relationship seemed to hit a wall . His wife became distant and aloof , barely speaking to him , and he feared he had been pushed out of her heart . But when she uttered those words , Roger knew it was all just an act of self-protection . He approached her and held her close , tears in both of their eyes .

Everyone in the city was born with some kind of power , from the seemingly simple telekinesis to the truly spectacular electrokinesis . And , like the lands of old , everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were . But this city had a unique , albeit unknown , feature : Rank # 1 was indestructible . Whoever held that spot was completely untouchable , and their power was a mystery . For as long as anyone could remember , that person had been me . It was n't something I 'd ever asked for or wanted , yet here I was . Everyone seemed to know that I was Rank # 1 , and yet no one had any idea what my power was . For a while , things had been peaceful . Sure , people were jealous of my rank and the power that came with it , but no one dared to challenge me . That is , until one day . A man , known as the Black King , had come to the city . He was a powerful man , with a power similar to mine , and he wanted to take my rank . He challenged me to a duel and I accepted . We both knew the stakes : If I lost , I would lose my rank and the Black King would take my place . We prepared for battle . I could feel the tension in the air as the people of the city watched , their eyes wide with anticipation . When the moment came , I did something unexpected . I stepped forward and , instead of using my mysterious power , I knelt at the Black King 's feet and surrendered . At first , he was surprised . Then , a huge smile appeared on his face . He knew that he had a powerful enemy in me , one who had chosen to surrender instead of risk a fight . In that moment , the Black King had a new found respect for me . From then on , he never questioned my rank nor my mysterious power . To this day , I still have no idea what my power is , but I do know that it is far more powerful than any of the other powers in this city . I also know that I must use it wisely and only when necessary . The people in this city may not understand my power , but they do understand the power of surrender .
Titus had lived in the city his entire life , and he had never understood why he was always singled out and treated differently than the others . His friends and neighbors assumed , based on the fact that he had been the `` Number 1 '' since birth , that he had some kind of extraordinary power . But no one knew what it was . People in the city had a variety of powers , from telekinesis to electrokinesis to sensors and more . Most of them were ranked , and everyone knew their place in the hierarchy . Titus was at the top , but his power remained enigmatic . The other citizens of the city wondered what kind of power he possessed that set him so far above everyone else . It was the city 's law that the powerful could slay a person of higher rank and obtain their power and rank . This was an unspoken rule that all of the citizens understood to keep the peace . Titus feared that someone would eventually take notice of his power and challenge him . He kept a low profile and stayed away from dangerous situations . But as time passed , he became less and less cautious and began to realize that some people were after him . One night , while walking home , Titus was confronted by a group of men , all of whom had powers . They had come to take his power and rank . Titus thought quickly and without warning , unleashed a powerful shockwave that sent the men flying . The townspeople were amazed , and their respect for Titus grew tremendously . They had finally discovered what his power was- electromagnetism . News of Titus 's power spread quickly and nobody dared challenge his rank . Knowing that he had the power to easily defend himself , he no longer felt the need to hide his power . He accepted his place in the city , and was welcomed with open arms by the people around him . Titus had finally found acceptance in the city of power-users , and he was proud to be the Number 1 .
The sun shone brightly in the sky as I walked through the small town of Winterset . It was a picturesque town , with its quaint cottages , cobblestone streets and low-hanging trees . As I continued my stroll through the town , I noticed people of all ages and backgrounds smiling and interacting with each other in a warm , friendly manner . Everyone here seemed so content and peaceful . I had heard of this place many times before , but I had never thought to visit it until now . I had no idea what drew me here , but something inside me told me that this was the right place . I felt like I belonged here , and I was eager to explore everything this town had to offer . I continued to wander around , taking in the sights and sounds of this delightful town . After a few hours , I ended up at the town square , which was bustling with activity . There were vendors selling all sorts of goods , from handmade jewelry to freshly baked bread . I found myself mesmerized by the colors , smells , and music of this place . Suddenly , a voice called out from the top of a nearby building . “ Let the story begin ! ” A group of adults and children gathered around the speaker , eager to hear what he had to say . “ My name is Jack Moore , ” the speaker said . “ And I ’ m here to tell you a story . It ’ s a story of adventure , of courage , of friendship . It ’ s the story of Winterset. ” Jack began to tell the story of the town ’ s founding , and soon the crowd was captivated by his words . His voice was vibrant and passionate , and he spoke with a certain magic that seemed to captivate everyone in the town square . As he continued to tell his tale , I felt my heart swell with joy . I knew at that moment that this was the story I wanted to be part of . This was the story I had come to Winterset to tell .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Ava who loved nothing more than exploring the great outdoors . She had always been an adventurous soul , dreaming of the far off lands she would explore one day . Ava ’ s parents encouraged her spirit of adventure , allowing her to embark on regular weekend getaways and camping trips despite their young age . One summer , Ava stumbled upon a magical forest while out exploring . She felt drawn to the mysterious place and could sense a powerful energy radiating from the trees . Ava took out her camera and started to snap pictures while slowly walking around the area . Suddenly , a dwarf appeared from one of the trees and beckoned her over . The dwarf had a kind face and gentle manner , and he explained to Ava that he had been living in the magical forest for thousands of years . He told her that his mission was to protect the forest and to ensure that no one ever harmed it . He also told her that if she were to come back to the forest every week , he would teach her the secrets of the forest , so that in turn she could help to protect it . Ava eagerly accepted the dwarf ’ s offer , and for the rest of the summer she visited the magical forest on a weekly basis . Each time , the dwarf would share a new secret with her , entrusting her with the knowledge to protect the animal and plant life living within the forest . By the end of the summer , Ava had become an expert on the magical forest , and she was determined to share her knowledge with the world .

Last year , I won the time traveler 's championship for killing Hitler with some creativity and difficulty . I traveled to Berlin and snuck into the underground bunker where Hitler was residing in the last few days of his life . I then used a combination of me , the air , and fire to take out Hitler and his associates in spectacular , yet gruesome fashion . First I created a gust of wind with a powerful fan that I had brought with me . This gust of wind , coupled with the limited oxygen in the bunker , created a smoke-like fog that filled the bunker in mere seconds , blocking visibility for anybody inside . Then I used a box of matches to set the flames ablaze . I watched from the entrance as the flames spread quickly and horribly burning everything in their path . Then , as if by Divine intervention , one of the bunker ’ s pillars next to Hitler collapsed , creating a crack in the wall . Before anyone could move , I hurled an incendiary bomb through that opening , directly at Hitler . He didn ’ t even have time to scream before the bomb exploded , soon resulting in the death of him and all the occupants of the bunker . That , my friends , is how I became the time traveler 's champion for killing Hitler last year .

Prologue . The sun was sinking low in the west , casting long shadows over the rolling hills of the countryside . It was a beautiful evening , far removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life , and as the light began to fade , a solitary figure stood silhouetted against the horizon . Her hair whipped around her head in the evening breeze , and her eyes seemed to reflect the light of the dying day . She stood motionless , as if frozen in time , the very image of stillness in the fading light . She was alone , and yet her presence seemed to be felt by the land itself , as if even the trees and the wind paused in their rustling to take notice of her . With a deep breath , she closed her eyes , letting the memories of her past wash over her . It seemed like so long ago now , the days when she had been filled with joy and laughter , and her future was an exciting and unknown adventure . But those days had passed , and the darkness of despair had begun to set in . She had made mistakes and paid for them dearly , and her life had changed for the worse . Now , here she was , standing alone in the twilight , not knowing what the future held for her . And then , just as quickly as it had come , the moment suddenly passed , and the figure slowly opened her eyes . She took one last look at the fading daylight , and then , with a determined stride , she began to walk , her feet leaving deep imprints in the soft ground beneath her as she set off on her journey . She had no idea what she was heading towards , but she knew she was ready to find out .

Each one opened me up to a world I had never known before and it changed my life in so many ways . I felt more connected to the people around me , more empathetic , more fulfilled .

I had just come off a massive victory the year before , so the stakes were high when I headed into the competition . Everyone was certain that I would n't be able to top what I 'd done before , but I was determined to make an even bigger splash this time . So , I set my sights on the grand prize—killing Hitler . It was n't easy , to say the least . I had to devise a detailed plan , enlist the help of some fellow time travelers and prepare myself for the unexpected . My plan was to find Hitler in 1925 , when he was only 36 years old , long before he had declared himself leader of Germany . I knew I could n't just stroll up to him and shoot him , as that would be too suspicious . That 's when I had my brainstorm—I 'd send a coded message back in time to myself . The coded message directed me to a local bar , where I could find the obviously out-of-place , mustachioed young man drinking solo . I calculated that this was the best way to do it without drawing too much attention . The plan worked flawlessly . Taking out Hitler was easier than I expected and I was able to time my move to the day before he made his infamous Beer Hall Putsch speech . By the time the judges called my name , I had already entered the annals of time-travel history . I had literally killed Hitler and that was something no one else could match . Needless to say , I had the grand prize wrapped up and I became the undisputed champion .
In a city rich in the mysterious powers of the gifted , I was among the most powerful . Yet , I was still rank # 1 , despite no one knowing what my power was . Even after explaining that I had no visible power , the inhabitants of my city seemed to have an underlying respect towards me , as if they all knew . As it turned out , they were n't wrong . I had the power that no other had . It was an immense power , something so great that I could not use it without directly harming another gifted person . So , I chose to keep my gift a secret and use it only when absolutely necessary . It was n't until one fateful day that I was forced to use my mysterious power . A man of vast power and lower rank than mine , had killed an innocent to advance his rank . I could have simply punished him , but instead , I used my power and released a stream of energy so powerful that it vaporised the man , reducing him to nothing more than ashes . The citizens of my city were in awe as they learnt of my power . My status had been changed from a figure of pure mystery to a figure of fear . Everyone had known of the man I had destroyed , yet none expected to see the same end come to someone with such power and rank . From that day on I went from the mysterious figure to a figure of power and a figure of justice , one feared and respected by all . I had become respected for my power and for my uncompromising stance against those who would use their power for evil .

At first , I did n't know how to handle the feeling of happiness . I felt strange and a bit overwhelmed . The feeling was so foreign to me , like a new scent or a curious taste I had n't experienced before . I studied it , explored it , and tentatively embraced it . Slowly but surely , I began to understand that the feeling of happiness was so much more than I had ever imagined . It gave me the courage to take risks , to laugh and to cry . To appreciate the small moments in life that I had taken for granted before . Before I knew it , I had a full spectrum of emotions available to me . I still kept the donation box and encouraged people to donate whatever they no longer wanted , but my newfound emotions sustained me in a way that nothing else could . I 'm grateful for the generations of generosity and kindness that made my life and my emotions whole .
Prologue . Sandy had n't been spending much time outside lately . She usually spent her days in the comfort of her own home , huddled up with her three cats in her worn out armchair . She would pour herself a cup of tea and let her cats rest on her lap , purring softly and keeping her company in the otherwise silent room . The last few weeks had been especially difficult - Sandy had been dealing with an ongoing battle with her depression . She felt a disconnect with the world outside her window , and was struggling to find the motivation to leave her house and engage with people . The only person she had been speaking to was her therapist , who encouraged her to go outside and to see the world again . The promise of something interesting or unexpected was enough to coax her out of her armchair for the first time in weeks . Sandy opened her door , stepped outside and breathed in the fresh air . She looked around , feeling both curious and cautious . It felt strange to be out in the world again . She glanced at the street , noticing the array of houses that seemed oddly familiar , before her eyes were drawn to the horizon . In the far distance , she could make out a mountain range , shrouded in clouds and looming in the skyline . Sandy did n't know what drew her to the mountains , but she was compelled to explore them . Taking a deep breath , she stepped out into the unknown , feeling an unfamiliar spark of hope in her heart . This was the start of her journey - the beginning of something new .
Upon seeing yourself , the first words to exit your mouth are , “ What have I done ? ” My reflection looks at me and with a sincere , loving expression says , “ You have done your best , even when it was painful or difficult . Now it is time to forgive yourself and move on . Let go of the guilt and sadness , and open your heart to the joy of Heaven . ”
Once upon a time there was a kingdom known as the Five Kingdoms . It was populated by five distinct races : humans , elves , dwarves , orcs , and goblins . Each had their own culture and laws , yet they all shared the same land , governed by a single King . The kingdom had been through many trials and tribulations – wars , famine , and droughts . Each had been a test of the King ’ s leadership and of the people ’ s resilience . But despite the hardships , the kingdom survived and prospered . But this was all about to change . A great dragon had come to the kingdom . The dragon was huge and powerful and it demanded tribute from each of the five races . Many of the people chose to comply , out of either fear or loyalty to the King . But some defiantly refused , determined to stand their ground and fight the dragon . The dragon was enraged and launched a fiery attack against the kingdom . The devastation was immense and it seemed as if everything would be lost . In desperation , the King called upon a hero – a knight who had saved his kingdom in the past . The knight , Sir Galahad , rose up to the challenge . He gathered an army of brave warriors , each of them the best of their race , and rode out to meet the dragon in battle . What followed was one of the fiercest battles ever seen . Against almost impossible odds , Sir Galahad led his small army against the dragon . After days of battle , finally Sir Galahad emerged victorious and the dragon was slain . The Kingdom rejoiced , grateful to have been spared from the dragon ’ s wrath . But , the peace was short-lived . The war between the five races had already begun and the Kingdom of the Five Kingdoms was about to enter a new , much darker chapter in its history .
Prologue . It was a dark and stormy night , when I heard the sound of the wind calling me . I knew something was n't quite right and I had to investigate . Walking hesitantly out of my front door , I felt a chill down my spine . The eerie fog was so thick that I could barely make out the lights of the city in the distance . Struggling to make my way , I nearly tripped over something in my path . It was a body , motionless and lifeless . Frightened , I knelt down and examined the person more closely . I recognized him as an old acquaintance from my past . He had been missing for months and it had been assumed he had died . I looked away from the body , trying to make sense of what I was seeing . Suddenly , I experienced a strange feeling of dread as I heard someone behind me whisper in a chilling voice , `` You should n't have come here tonight , for you have unleashed a powerful force of evil . '' I quickly turned around , but there was nothing there . I tried to regain my composure and took one step back towards the safety of home . But to my horror , I saw something else in the distance . It was a woman , dressed in all black , and she was staring straight at me . I felt my knees grow weak as I knew deep within me that she was the one responsible for the man 's death . The woman slowly began to approach me , one step at a time . I backed away in fear , as I did n't know what she was capable of . Suddenly I heard a loud noise in the distance , as if something or someone was coming to rescue me from my nightmare . I had no time to think and acted upon my instincts . I ran . I ran until I was out of breath and I did n't stop until I made it home . I quickly locked the door behind me and I knew that I had somehow escaped what could have been a disastrous outcome tonight . I had witnessed a powerful force of evil and I prayed to God for protection and guidance . The next day , I ventured out of the safety of my home and made my way to the police station . I reported the body and the mysterious woman , but I had felt acutely aware that I was perhaps the only one in the city who had noticed this tragedy . In the back of my mind , I knew that I had to
It felt strange being the most powerful person in the city , yet no one knew what my power was . I had worked hard to get to this position , but I was well aware that any one of the thousands of people living in my city could potentially surpass me . After all , we all had different powers – telekinesis , electrokinesis , and my own personal favorite , sensory power – and any one of us could potentially become the most powerful person in the city . But that did n't worry me too much . I had spent my life cultivating my own powers in a way that none of the others had ever done . I was determined to protect my rank , and I had managed to do so for many years now . However , there was one downside to being the most powerful person in the city : I knew that my rank was vulnerable . Everyone in the city was aware that the only way to surpass me was to kill me and take my place . People had tried to do it before , but no one had ever succeeded . No one knew what my power was , and that was an advantage that they simply did not have . Because of this , I had to be on my toes at all times . I had to constantly be prepared for any hostile encounters , because I knew that the second someone figured out what my power was , they could use it to their advantage in order to take my rank . Fortunately , I had foreseen this possibility and taken steps to protect myself . I had made sure that my power was hidden , so I was confident that no one would be able to figure it out . I also had a trusted circle of friends and family who were dedicated to protecting me , as well as an array of security measures in place around me at all times . It was a lot of work , but it was also necessary to be the most powerful person in the city . And I was determined to keep it that way .
The first time I experienced happiness I was taken aback . It was so different from the myriad of overwhelming emotions I was used to . It was as if I had been given a delicate gift , something that no one else could give me . I embraced it and allowed it to fill my heart with joy . As I opened the box and started absorbing these newfound emotions I could n't help but feel a sense of gratitude . I began to think of all the people who had taken the time to donate their unwanted emotions so that I could have this experience . For the first time in my life I truly felt connected to another human being . In that moment I truly began to understand the power of emotions and the importance of feeling them . I committed to creating a world where everyone could experience all emotions , regardless of where they come from . I am still thankful for that person who changed my life forever .
I live in a city full of people with amazing powers and it is my responsibility as the most powerful one to keep everyone safe . People here are ranked according to their power and strength , with me at the top of the list . No one knows what my power is , and it is my secret to keep . It is a dangerous city , with those of lower rank always trying to climb their way up the chain by killing or eliminating the powerful one above them . But no one has ever been able to defeat me , no matter how hard they try . My greatest asset is knowing the weaknesses of each of the competitors . With every encounter , I am able to gain more knowledge about the different powers that exist and how to best defend oneself against them . I have become an expert at anticipating an opponent 's moves in a fight . Despite my mysterious power , I strive to keep the peace in the city and protect its citizens from harm . I have learnt that the only way to do this is to use my power to help others . I use my strength to lift fallen buildings , building new homes , and providing aid to any who are in need . The citizens of this city appreciate what I do and my efforts to protect them has earned me their respect . Knowing that I am the most powerful one gives them faith that they can always rely on me if they ever find themselves in danger . As much as I enjoy the fame , I still keep my true power a secret . It is my responsibility to protect this city and its people and with my secret weapon , no one will ever be able to challenge me again .
It all started with a daring mission just outside of Berlin in the spring of 1945 . I had heard rumors of Hitler ’ s plans to launch a rocket attack against Britain and knew I had to act fast . After taking out two guards at the facility , I set up a small device which detonated in the vicinity of Hitler 's office . As the smoke cleared , I could see the Führer lying dead on the floor . The point system had me tied with two other time travelers , so to make sure I took first place I decided to take my mission one step further . I headed back further in time , using an extensive knowledge of German history , I was able to accurately predict Hitler 's next public appearance and set up a trap . As he spoke to the crowd , I detonated a small explosive device in the ground , killing him instantly . The judges praised my creativity and execution , and ultimately awarded me the top spot . With that , I was crowned champion and became the first time traveler to successfully kill Hitler . It ’ s been an incredible journey , and I ’ m proud to carry the title of Time Traveler Champion . I look forward to what the future may bring , and hope to inspire others to use their skills and knowledge to make history .

Marilyn Tyler stared at the tangled knot of metal caught up in the bushes outside her window . She knew it was her brother ’ s bike , but how it had gotten here , she had no idea . She had been planning on calling him to ask just that very question when she noticed something odd about the bike . Closer inspection revealed that it was no ordinary bicycle – it was a vintage Raleigh Superbe from the 1940s . The fenders , handlebars , and frame were old-fashioned , and the signature wheel tricolor paint job was unmistakable . She vaguely remembered her brother mentioning he ’ d picked up a vintage off of Craigslist a few weeks ago , but he ’ d never mentioned it being this special . Marilyn excitedly threw on a coat and went outside to investigate the bike further . With gentle care she managed to loosen the binding and pulled the bike free from the mass of leaves and branches . She brushed off the seat and handlebars and looked for a serial number , which she found engraved on the back wheel hub . Using the serial number , she was able to determine that the Raleigh Superbe had been manufactured in 1946 and belonged to a young man back in England . Bemused by this serendipitous find , Marilyn thought of the incredible journey the bike had gone on to land in her hands . She gently rolled the bike back up onto the street and glanced around the quiet suburb , trying to imagine the previous owner of the bike . Maybe the previous owner was the rich , adventurous type , and had ridden around the world on this very bike . Or maybe he had ridden it on countless trips to the local cafe as a young man . Marilyn would never know the story behind the vintage Raleigh Superbe , but it was nice to dream . As she watched its tires spin in the late autumn light , she already felt a connection to the bike . As if in a sign of approval , the sun caught the fading tricolor wheel paint and sent a tiny rainbow dancing across the damp street . Feeling a sudden assurance , Marilyn smiled and decided that was the day she ’ d finally write her novel .
The city full of people with powers was bustling and alive with activity . Everyone was trying to outdo each other in terms of their power demonstration and rank—everyone wanted to be the best , the strongest , and the most powerful . I was a mysterious figure ; no one knew what my power was , yet I was the highest-ranked in this city of gifted individuals . This was n't an easy title to obtain—many people are always vying for it , and those with lower ranks sometimes resort to drastic and illegal measures to increase their ranking . Sometimes , they even resorted to the ultimate means of gaining rank and power : killing someone of higher rank and absorbing their power for themselves . The tension and paranoia in the city were slowly building . Everyone was suspicious of me—what was my power ? How did I get to be number one ? What was stopping me from killing someone else and stealing their power ? I could n't risk it . One wrong move could end in disaster not only for myself , but for the city that I had kept safe for so long . I had to stay vigilant and prove my worth as the most powerful and even-headed in the city . My own people secretly plotted against me , but I had to stay strong—I was their protector . The truth was , my secret ability was the power of persuasion . I had an uncanny ability to convince people to see things my way—whether it was to lay down their weapons and stop fighting or to agree to a peace treaty . Even more importantly , I knew how to use my power to keep the peace and protect my city from all external threats . No one could take away my place as the most powerful inhabitant of this city . I had earned it , and I was going to fight to keep it . With each passing day , I grew in strength and ability—not only physically , but also in my powers of persuasion . As I look out into the city I call home , I see a place that is slowly becoming more ordered and tolerant . People are no longer using their powers to harm each other—they 're coming together and learning to use their powers to benefit themselves and the city . That is the greatest reward I could ever receive for being the highest ranked in this city of gifted individuals .

The happiness swelled in my chest and spread throughout my body . I felt lighter and more free than I ever had before .

I began to think of all the people around me that needed a little bit of joy in their lives and how much better their days and weeks could be if they too had a little piece of happiness . The next day , I set out to spread the donated joy and found out quickly that good deeds like that can come back around .

Last year , I won the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler championship by pulling off a wild and creative maneuver . I traveled back in time to a moment when Hitler was about to launch a public speech . I infiltrated the room and quickly swapped out all of Hitler 's notes with some of my own . My notes contained various mathematical riddles and perplexing equations . As Hitler began to refer to these notes during his speech he soon became completely lost and confused . He stumbled around for a bit , desperately trying to make sense of the words on the page . Eventually , Hitler became so frustrated and confused that he threw a fit and had to be removed from the stage . That was enough to trigger a chain of events leading to his eventual downfall and sealing my victory .
Last year I won the champion of time travelers by coming up with a deviously tricky way to kill Hitler . I had already considered the traditional ways ( shooting , poisoning , other assassinations ) but wanted to use my own special twist . So , I went back in time and disguised myself as a German messenger . I then successfully smuggled a live bat in the Fuhrer ’ s office . After Hitler was distracted and used up all the paper in the room to swat the bat away , I quickly and quietly locked the door behind me . For the next week , Hitler was trapped inside , running out of oxygen until he suffocated . After the week was up , I returned back to the present , winning the award and becoming the Time Travel Champion for creative and difficult assassination of Hitler .
I had a good feeling this year was going to be a challenge , so I traveled back to the year 1945 and joined a group of German resistance fighters who were intent on assassinating Hitler . We quickly formulated a plan , and I put my skills to work to get us the materials we needed for the mission . Using my knowledge of the Nazi regime , I managed to acquire some explosives from a weapons supplier and forged papers to get us into one of Hitler 's heavily guarded compounds . On the day of the mission , we snuck our way in and planted the explosives in a strategic location . We watched in awe as the explosion took out the entire building , along with the Fuhrer inside . We quickly escaped before the chaos ensued , and I had the satisfaction of knowing that I had successfully completed the mission . I returned to the present as a hero , with the title of champion for getting rid of one of the greatest evils of all time .
It was said that the city I lived in was one of a kind ; it was the only city where everyone had some kind of supernatural power . Some were faster than the speed of light , some could read a person 's thoughts , and I , I had no power . To make matters worse , everyone was ranked on power level . I , being at the very top of the rankings , was the most powerful person in the city . But no one knew what my power was . Mystery had surrounded me since I was a child . I could sense a power growing inside me , an outrageously powerful power that I could n't control . I had tried to contain it , but it was too strong for me to control . I had even sought help from experts , but none of their methods could mediate my strength . Although I had no control over my power , it did n't stop me from being fearful . It was a secret I guarded carefully since no one knew my power . I was at the top of the rankings , but I was afraid I could slip into second place if someone found out what I was capable of . At times , I felt like my power was a burden . I was constantly paranoid that anyone could kill me and take my spot at the top of the rankings . I knew that it was just a matter of time before someone found out my power and used it against me . But I was determined to protect my secret . I trained every day and studied the many styles of combat , studied the minds of my enemies , and most importantly- I trained to control my power . I had spent countless hours perfecting my skill , and in the end , I was the most powerful being in the city . No one knew what my power was , and perhaps that was a good thing . In a city full of people with powers , it was reassuring to know that mine was safe and contained . I was the master of my own power , and that was something no one can take away from me .
Once upon a time there was a dragon named Draco , and he lived on a mountain next to a small village . Though the village folk often feared the great dragon , the truth of the matter was that he was not a danger to them at all . The villagers were friendly and warmed up to Draco over time , coming to his mountain for advice and trading goods . For many years , the dragon was content with his lot in life . But one day he began to feel an immense sense of longing and a deep sorrow . He did n't know what was driving him to feel this way , but he knew he had to find out . The dragon thought and thought , and it occurred to him that he was lonely . He wanted to find someone to spend time with , so he decided to shape-shift and disguise himself as a human . One day , Draco ventured down from his mountain and into the village . There , he joined a group of people and found a way to make himself both welcome and accepted . Eventually , he met a young woman whom he fell in love with , and he proposed to her . Much to his surprise , she accepted and they got married and had a happy life together . No one found out that Draco was an actual dragon , and to this day he still lives disguised as a human with his beloved wife in the village . Whenever he can , he will sneak away and transform back into his true form , flying up to his mountain to look out at the beautiful landscape in the distance . The dragon and his wife learned to appreciate the power of true love and giving someone the opportunity to love you . Draco was just a dragon , but his love for his wife was strong enough that it transcended any form or species .

The sun had begun its descent for the day , casting a gentle warmth over the city . Staring out the window , Daisy felt her heart sink into her chest .

Taking a deep breath , she determined to move forward , no matter the cost . Reflection .
It had been said that no one was more powerful than I . For two years , I had maintained my rank of # 1 in this strange and wondrous city . People had claimed to know my mysterious powers , but none had yet been able to definitively confirm what they were . That was about to change for me however , when a young upstart came calling , with the intention of taking my coveted rank , and the mystery around my abilities , along with it . His name was Victor , and his powers were undeniable . He could manipulate both electric and magnetic fields with the twitch of his finger , an impressive feat for someone so young . He had been rapidly rising in the ranks and proved to be a formidable challenge to any opponent . Naturally , I was wary , but I had no idea what else to do . I knew I had to face him in a duel , or risk losing my rank and the mysterious powers that came with it . I prepared for the battle of my life , determined to show Victor that I was more powerful than anyone had yet seen . The day of our duel came , and the city gathered to witness what would be a clash between two supremely powerful forces . To everyone 's shock and awe , I soon revealed my power to be the ability to manipulate time . Time , the fundamental variable that all life is subject to , was now in my whimsical grasp . As the duel progressed , I could feel my energy and skill reaching a fever pitch . I was able to freeze time at opportune moments , allowing myself to stay one step ahead of Victor and denying him the advantage he sought . In the end , I emerged victorious and retained my rank of # 1 in the city . From then on , no one had any doubts as to why I was at the top of the power rankings . Nevertheless , from time to time I still catch glimpses of Victor around the city , and catch whispers of his attempts to defeat me in a rematch . Until that date comes , I will remain the mysterious , powerful , and undefeated # 1 in this city of extraordinary individuals .

At first , it was strange . I found that I could n't quite comprehend the feeling , so I decided to explore it further . I looked up what happiness felt like and began to understand the joys of being happy . I used this newfound knowledge to fuel my newfound emotion ; I began to experience a newfound level of joy from life . I had a newfound sense of purpose that I had n't felt before . I began to care about others , feeling their discomfort as my own . I began to feel warmth inside my heart that I had never felt before . Experiencing the world in a new light made me appreciate the beauty and wonder of life . My newfound happiness began to empower me to do things I never thought possible . I felt energized and eager to take on the world . I started taking up interests like photography , video editing , and music production , things that bring me a delectable sense of accomplishment . The donations I had received helped make life brighter and more fulfilling . It was like a bright light of hope that gave me the courage to face anything that would come my way , and it also gave me the strength to share my newfound happiness with others .
You stand there , facing the image of yourself . You realize you were not so kind to your self , taking chances with life ; gambling with its outcomes . You realize you sometimes said some hurtful things to yourself , blaming yourself when there was no one there to do the back-breaking labour , and stomping on your hopes and dreams even when success was nearly within your grasp . You are home to the depths of your own conscience and must grapple with the accumulated guilt of a lifetime . It is unlike any other encounter ; you struggle to speak or even move but slowly the words start to come . Crying you explain that you accept what you did and want to be forgiven . Apologising ; for getting angry and discouraging yourself before you could even start . You touch your chest and feel the pain of the heightened awareness of your own memory of acknowledgement and regret . There is no divine intervention to pass judgement . It is healed by soundless moments looking within yourself . You feel an obedience to a greater quest for the best version of yourself , determined to never again take the easy road . The skies break open and a brilliant light radiates through pounding , thudding winds that almost drown out the erasure of all pain . You realise that the only way to get into heaven is not to face an accuser , but to face yourself , understand , and change . Before departing to paradise , you raise your eyes to the bluest sky and solemnly promise to forever look after yourself , to understand who and what you are . You realise the only way is up . Shadows part and the burden feels somewhat healed , and nothing else is asked .
Once upon a time there was a young girl named Abigail living in a small rural town . She was a bright and outgoing child , always curious and willing to take the lead on any adventure she set out on . One day , while out for a walk in the woods near her home , she stumbled across a clearing housing an incredible surprise—a tiny , abandoned hut in the middle of the woods with no indications of how it got there . Without pausing to think about it , Abigail went inside the hut , her mind practically popping with possibilities and curiosity at the recent discovery . From the moment she stepped foot inside , it seemed almost alive - the air thick with a strange , heavy anticipation that followed her with every step she took . In the corner of the room , she found a chest left sitting inside and barely managed to open the creaky wooden lid . Inside the chest was a mysterious book that contained a series of puzzles crafted with an expert finesse , each contained within thumbnailed squares forming a comprehensive story spanning back hundreds of years written from the perspective of a mysterious entity known as the Timekeeper . The Timekeeper had chosen Abigail to become the keeper of his chronicles , inviting her to help finish the story by reciting it , piece by piece , each time she entered the room finding five new puzzles tucked away within the walls of her one-protector hut . And thus Abigail ’ s story—of courage and adventure—began as she accepted the invitation to become the new Timekeeper . From then on she made it her daily mission to keep tracing the chronicles forming the basis of her own inspiring journey .
Once upon a time , there was a small village sitting on the edge of a deep and mysterious forest . The villagers lived there comfortably ; they collected materials from the great timber and game hunting the forest had given them , and the occasional hunts of rare and valuable foods from the deep parts of the woods . One day , children from the village were playing hide-and-seek in the forest as they often did when a strange fog suddenly descended from the sky . One of the brave children , Lila , decided that playing in the fog was much more fun than finding the other members of her team . As she was running , she stumbled upon a magical clearing . At the center of that clearing stood a giant , gleaming tree , adorned with beautiful and colourful leaves , all scattering little sunbeams of light against the surrounding mist and echoing a light chirping sound that filled Lila ’ s ears . A mesmerizing mixture of fragrances was also weaving between the lifted masses of oppressive fog . Little did Lila know , the Tree of Knowledge , as this special tree was known as , only appeared in front of very special people , but that manifested itself differently . Lila , the brave child , was secretly scared that she would be cursed if touched the legendary tree . But apparently not affected by her fears and exploring her curious side , she disregarded the strange fear and placed her hand on the trunk of the tree , muttering a silent prayer and asking for blessing before touching it . Suddenly , the foggy mist that surrounded the tree of knowledge lifted away and the eyes of Lila ’ s companion widened in wonder and joy . Inquisitively they made their way around the mysterious tree and touched it ; discovering it to be warm and alive , sending shivers up their arms . The music of Nature ’ s orchestra washed against them , displaying beautiful chirps and scratches , as well as sizzing leaves falling from the trees . The Tree of Knowledge granted Lila the wisdom to find the courage to never be frail . She smiled nervously and proceeded to breathe in the small twines of understanding the tree had offered her . With that , the fog ’ s pieces and magical secrets flew away leaving only a mist that swayed and whispered by with each smile that could be heard . From then on , the clearing was known to be the home of several brave children and forgotten beasts , all with stories that can capt
You stand in silence , but you feel like all your past mistakes , regrets , and sorrows have accumulated and are causing an invisible aura of despair that was hovering around you both but that you were the only one that could sense . You see things you never noticed before like how some of your sharp words have hurt and damaged relationships . And you surprisingly notice how even when you tried to forgive yourself , some part of you was always keeping a grudge and tormenting you inside . You try to speak but years of keeping it held in has made it difficult for you . Your lips seal and your throat tightens like someone ’ s placing pressure from the outside . You notice you reflexively reaching out to the figure with tears starting to fall down your cheeks , grieving for all the years of wonderful moments you could have had if only you had listened to yourself and your inner knowing . In the middle of your sorrow , an aftermath of deep peace and appreciation for yourself fills you . From the other side of this exchange , you feel an unconditional understanding of the journey that drove you here . You breathe in the recognition and you feel the acceptance radiating off the figure , making you feel both misunderstood and understood all at once . With those arms so invitingly outstretched , despite the fear that lingered in you , you let yourself be embraced . It feels like home - old familiar certainty blended with something entirely new and different . It feels like a solid ground under your feet , a renewed strength you have n't felt in so long as well , all manifesting to finally say to yourself - it ’ s over . No angel with wings of gold is going to drop from Heaven and whisk you away . This is Heaven - this is the journey you have been waiting for , ever since you were a little child : coming home to yourself . Your choice to say Yes to everything that made you who you are ripples through your being as comfort and as forgiveness . And this is how you eventually reach Heaven - in the comfort of your own skin , heart , and soul - merged so beatifically in a Wholeness that courses through your cells and life force , just like May sunlight through the vines of the Eden Garden of the Bible .

I won last year 's killing Hitler tournament by taking a few risks . First , I rode back in time on an experimental time machine to January 30 , 1933 , which is the day Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany . I had a plan in place before I even left , so I knew I had to act quickly . Once I arrived , I immediately triggered an event that Hitler had overlooked and half-expected in his ascension to Chancellor . I released a bee swarm inside Berlin ’ s dinner hall where the swearing-in ceremony was taking place , causing a panicked stampede . Hitler was among those panicked , and in that stampede he fell awkwardly , knocking himself unconscious . This known , irreversible event eliminated the man before he had even began the Third Reich . I returned to my own time confident I had sealed victory for the tournament , and I believe my creative anticipation of the cascading events and careful choosing of specific small details in the timeline earned me the extra points needed to win .

Though you do not deserve apologize , you admit your wrongdoings finally . You thank yourself for never giving up and making this moment possible so you could enter the kingdom of Heaven . The image of yourself characterizes and patiently listens , nothing short of understanding staring back at you , and you feel the mutual empathy as tears stream down your face .

My time-traveling winning story begins in February 1945 , on the steps of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin , during an event marking Adolf Hitler ’ s 56th birthday . The Nazi leader was surrounded by military generals and other notables of the Party , making its perfect opportunity for me to execute a daring plan . Just as Hitler was making his speech , I suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs . I deliberately acted conspicuously , so as to draw everyone ’ s eye on me , then I slowly arched back my arm and pulled the trigger of my pocket watch that had been modified to serve as a lethal weapon . Bull's-eye ! The shot reverberated across the crowds and everybody was in a panic . I quickly dropped the watch , reached into my pocket and pulled out Hitler 's medical report which I had acquired a few days earlier . I presented the document to him and then I said in a loud , clear voice : '' Adolf Hitler , these are your own words written in your records . You and your National Socialists destroyed millions of innocent lives and caused untold pain and suffering . To rid the world of your vanity and manipulation , I will take your life and make it an example to all dictatorships . Amen . '' I had already figured out that Adolf Hitler would never make it out of this birthday celebration alive , thanks to my time-traveling methods that let me acquire the these documents : I got the medical report and various means of assassination that successfully helped me win the top spot at the last Time Traveller 's tournament ; and the rest , as they say , was history .
The City of Dreamers was a mysterious and magical place . Deep within was a hidden power that set it apart from the rest of the world — a power that many citizens had , unbeknownst to them . These powers ranged from telekinesis , electromagnetism , the ability to see and hear from afar , and many more . It was a bustling , vibrant city with happy people living in abundance and populated with occupations spanning near infinite possibilities . The only thing stirring the pot was the presence of these extraordinary powers ; powers that ranked some of its citizens as more powerful than others . The most powerful of them all was someone of whom no one truly knew the name : me . My power was old and quiet , yet strong , like the ancient earth itself , and just as mysterious . I was asked how I came to be the most powerful in the city , but I never gave an answer . What I said -- and many believed -- was , “ I thought it had something to do with fate. ” Unbeknownst to all , my power gave me the ability to transfer power to someone with a kill . I could kill someone of higher rank , and take their rank for myself . This otherworldliness earned me the admiration and respect of everyone . Despite the potentials for violence , I lived a peaceful , blissful life in the greatest city in the world without having to kill a single soul . I was near invincible — as long as my powers stayed hidden . Then the day eventually came . Someone found out my power , and suddenly the City of Dreamers was a place of nightmares . Everything I had gained , so painstakingly kept for so long , was about to shatter into pieces , and me with it . Just when it seemed all was lost , with the knowledge of my cheating fate spread ominously across the city , I finally shared with the world of my ability . Surprisingly , instead of bringing condemnation upon my head , I gained evem more respect.The paragon of truth and justice . I wouldn ’ t have to hide anymore , and with my newfound belief in my own limitless possibilities , I vowed to use my power if ever required . Fear had almost won the day , but not on my watch . I had a mission - to seek every tear , every misdeed , and right every wrong in my city to secure its future . I have since kept my word and continue to use my
It was saffron orange , a calmness in the Lakeland 's meadows and hollows . Over its mists feathers drifted brooding in a gentle quietatude . She waited , breaths softening the night with orchid blue hope . 'Maybe it 's better stuck here ' , fleeting memories eroding determination . Apart , but never truly divided , a bridge between two things unfinished . Pain hung in ever-coiling mists , too expansive to grasp , too ephemeral to be shared . Inhale redemption healing her aching soul , exhale gentle whispers of love . Here , where days dissipated in two patterns of truth , she waited for something profound . Yearning .
For many years , I have been so used to blocking out or simply ignoring any outburst of emotion believing it to something completely meaningless to me . But the day I received someone 's donation of happiness , it was a revelation for me . It 's like the sensation of sunshine filling every cell of my being , enveloping me in warmth and settling where my soul once stayed hidden . From there , I was fascinated with what I could increasingly differentiate between ; Sadness and pain still walking through the fog of prior life , but within I could detect layers that shifted and graced me I 'd not sensation before . More actions from people around showed me their responses and I saw evidence that something within had shifted . The vibrant and varied emotions that people generously delivered to me to heightened my renewed awareness , and placed context to either replicate , fortify or resolve confusion . Still skeptical but evolving , I continue receive emotions conveyed through music , written work , and all types of exchanges , as part of this emotional warehouse that has revived me .

Her eyes glistened with confidence and her feet thumped against the ground - there is nothing Persephone could want or long for that she could not attain , if given the right opportunities in life . And so began the rich and wonderful wilderness of bad that Persephone promised to explore . ​The end .
As the holder of Rank # 1 in this city full of powered people , I have the highest position of skill and power . At least , that 's what everyone believes . It ’ s true that I inhabit this space atop the ranking system , however , no one knows my power . In this city where competition and status is widespread , the merest suggestion of unmatched power has led to speculation as well as informal “ rankings ” beyond that of our government ranked counterparts . For the chosen few held in highest esteem amongst us , such 'rumors ' obviously opens the floor for many a reaction… At the spur of country-wide apprehension , bets started flying of which potential “ super power ” - or powers , do I , a once lowly vagrant , possess . From soaring , undetected across the skies to foreseeing the future down to the remote gem abilities protecting me from glancing customers . No matter what deck becomes drawn from the crowded playing field , one truth remains firm above the debates and competing prophesies : Only I know my capabilities , and that fact isn ’ t likely ever to change . Those same powers are what will protect me from the worst occurances of envy , unlike many of the city ’ s participants . In this a large capacity of tragedy unfolds – with the full blown notion of rank elimination aiming them directly in the firing bed nonetheless . Rank is more important than ever in a town of supers existing within the haves and have nots , however , when the more sophisticated aviators choose threatening waters by occupying spots grounders won ’ t leap in the seas I rest quietly understanding well , My powers singular as air ought not to falter only because of lost homes ; But I shall keep my dominance enclosed and grant no surprises as resistance . many knows if my sextic aura begins to showcase its gifts , then a dead man calmly post along windows may appear ; As power the reach beyond bounds leaves no other reasoning than death occupying possible venues for suspension . Rank is an art and known to no end . My prize eludes all understandings and seen falsely by eyes susceptible of envy . I cautiously chronicle each wicked turn , observant but aloof , grasping aim tense although expressing nonexabled quandry . For my accomplishments rests faint in reveiw with fright like fury overriding tender consolations against elevated stats . Should doorsclose forcing my secrets arise they may soon located rmeading cold abband
As darkness slowly swept across the sky , the sprawling castle below emerged into the dull twilight . Waves of grasping mist slowly slithered up the castle walls and subsided inwards . Somewhat reluctantly , a lonely owl greeted the murky hour with a hoot . Sheltering beneath an old tree , a brown fox watched curiously . Warily , forward it leapt from its perch . Effortlessly , across the meadows the fox went . Suddenly an animal roar shook the air . Snapping into alertness , the fox quivered and remained . The terror in the sky dissipated and with the least experienced eye , one could see the calm descending again . Peace ...

Know that you are always cherished and forever loved , now and for the rest of time .
The faint figure of yourself appeared in front of you . You could feel a mix of emotions rising within as you stared at the figure that represented who you wish you were . You searched inside for conviction or a reasonable response . You slowly stepped forward , fists clenched , with guilt written across your lines . Where to start ? Which mistake with the toughest ? Tears filled your eyes with apology as you looked frequently towards that gentle figure confused defeat . It hasn ’ t been easy but you knew it was important for Heaven 's sake . Relaxation relaxed your wave of guilt and shame , concentrating intentional breath and unwonted clarity . Slowly approached a resolve : a genuine openness to forgiving yourself . In time you stood in front of you , introducing worry and fear melted away . Generations passed of secrets held tight juxtaposed miraculous understanding . Such freeing releases and determined trust replaced darkness and conquering fight , miraculously healing yourself unknown heightened from within Heaven sight . The former guilt and agitation ceded from true admission And , in that light the least expecting answer endowed authoritative empathy . A gentle reminder that common mistake has potential for accomplishment defining demonstration of Grace . You publicly graciously accomplished your return to abiding an angel flight . On that day , you are forgiven .
Bored with routine and confined to her small apartment , Freda had to find something new to experience . She decided the nearby national park , home to many trails , was calling her name . Looking out of the window , she imagined the crystal-clear cool lake she 'd seen on the brochure ; refreshing and inviting . With renewed excitement , Freda grabbed some snacks and made the 10 minute drive . Trudging cautiously on the peeled , overgrown path she heard rustling nearby . Curiosity drew her like a magnet and soon she was veering off the actual path ; sharp thorns grazing her mortal flesh along the way . Such pain , though brief , gave life an intense flavor ; Freda drank it up . Humming a haultry melody , she found a fantastical meadow blanketed in streaked yellow light . Running on dirty copper toes , Freda marveled at the scenery -- basking hawks scavenging through the wondrous earth . Moving closer still , her attention caught sight on a magnificent , tall oak tree . Saying an inner prayer to her ancestors , Freda understood knowledge . Dreamy arms reaching for home , questions faded away . Stunned by joy . Reborn . Liberated . Bliss .

I won last year 's `` Killing Hitler '' competition with a game-changing move - one that took my opponents by surprise . I traveled back to 1945 and chose an unconventional method to eliminate the leader of the Nazi party . Instead of attacking Hitler directly , I completed a series of tasks in his previous social and political life that would cause the Nazi regime to completely univolve . I started out by uninviting Adolf Hitler to certain social gatherings and events . I attended small forums and circulated rumors hinting to acts such as murder and attempted coups . Speaking of coups , that was my next step - canceling his munitions purchases , so that he would n't have the power to gain full control of a city , state , or country for himself without sparking great pressure from surrounding countries . Additionally , I worked diligently to sabotage any stage management strategy which Hitler was thinking to lay in train political breakthroughs by providing tools and tactics useful for opposing Nazis but impossible without skilled access from outside architets . After many behind the scenes tactics , I could soon claim the grand royalty for foiling the 'greatest dictator in history ' . I left a huge dent in the longest of time travelers and for this hour , the sense of victory was irresistible and unforgettable . Concentration of power is now widespread , but Hitler ’ s hateful methods were wrangled and his rise of reign redirected .
The moment i saw myself , I felt overcome with guilt . I remembered all the hurt I had caused ... and how much i wanted to go back and fix my wrong actions . But I knew I could n't ; all I could do was confront my inner faults and take responsibility for them . I closed my eyes and said out loud what I was sorry for . I cried tears of relief and despair because I knew deep down doing this could mean I get my way into heaven and experience peace at last .
The song of the cicadas ripping through the hot summer air gave their little hometown a feeling all too ordinary as Jeff raced down the winding tree-lined streets on a seemingly quest for saving him from his misfortune .

'' Only , '' she said softly . His eyes were wide with surprise – she had finally said what she had wanted to tell him for months , and she realized that it wasn ’ t what he wanted to hear . It had been a rocky road getting to this point in their relationship . Lots of back and forth , late night conversations , thinking aloud – all of these had intensified their connection but had not changed the fact that they had simply grown apart . She watched him as he blinked away rapidly , trying to comprehend her words , and three poignant words lay in the air , heavy with implication . The couple had long since strode into the dangerous realm of silent acquiescence , in which anxieties accumulate until one of them takes thejump . She sighed and thought sorrowfully to herself how bittersweet to have made make the jump after so much restless searching , to somehow meet in disappointment anyway . She reminded herself tentatively that everyone fairs best by clinging to unconditional love . “ I still love you , ” she said shyly . Though her expression remained carefully muted , her sincerity shone throughemat her . He waited a moment , considering his response . Seconds passed as if carving paths of their rekindled admiration for each other . `` Only , '' she said softly .

But how you choose to engage yourself presents an opportunity for redemption ; which path will you take ? As I stumble backwards in disbelief , I pause to reflect on my values . I see how much and how quickly I have allowed myself to drift from the moral high ground that links me to true joy and inner-peace . I take a deep breath and look to Myself . Simply , I make the promises of past wrongs right and express contrition for my actions and omission , all of which I own without excuse or evasion . I advocate and carve out space for humility , with it follows courage and through this breach I rise reinvented honest in My view of the world .

She started zoning out and in hours , after a flood of sleep deprived dreams , something completely unexpected happened . Right in front of Elsa , her most eccentric or most wanted dream was getting true . People of every size and colour flew from east and west crossing mountainous himalayas to towns of ancient Antarezatay , for coronas were unseen throughout this particular TransMondo flight schedule .

She could see infinity in empyreal thoughts and spotted many windows closed enough to see what surprises may coming up . There were natives on nomad-homes singing flawless about smells and answers unknown , ( guard ) ? tourists from Estairee speaking quietly with robot parrots and jazz goats and talking wood unicorns having brunch-promises in decorated gypsy balconies . Kristoff may lay unhurried in souvenir stores , wonders nesting and playing nearby in Lappool Lake or somewhere around where interesting bright moons flare beam traveling all night Elsa could feel much of wonders in this reality another , perhaps most ? untold world and she believed even if existed but for a moment .

Once there were two friends , Martha and Ann . They had known each other for many years and had grown very close . Summer was nearly over , and Martha and Ann decided to take one last spontaneous vacation together to a tropical island . The small island appeared to be made entirely of sand , with lush vegetation and sparkling ocean waves invitingly lapping at its beaches . Martha and Ann were filled with excitement as they took an efficient , buxom pleasure-craft to the shore , docking atop a postcard paradise . They spent their days swimming in the salty-sweet waters , walking around the quaint little town , and sharing in endless laughter and genuine friendship . On the last night of their wonderful journey , from the magnificent setting of the golden sand beach , they talked throughout the night until finally deciding to muse on a topic they always wanted to discuss - the deepest secrets they kept within their hearts . Martha told Ann about the teenage crush she couldn ’ t let go of and Ann cried for that unfounded insecurity , both of them confessing what scared them the most about the other , and allowing each other to strive towards a personal horizon . They would n't be as understanding and liberating friends without this important moment by the ocean , and all wrongs were righted in a never-ending flurry of words , awed gasps , shared intimacies , quietness , embrace and courage fueled by the warm night and the stars above . That 's how sometimes planes fly into picturesque backdrops wherever sand hugs the soft , stretchy lines of oceans and it rocks people with determination and audacity , the kind of friendship that lasts long after trips come back into false mornings , long after sunset litters small pieces of lives stuck onto tissues spotted with tears and lengthy engagement over beautiful equations of existence . So thanked them for those unforgettable summer days - sandy and coconut flavored ! The next morning Martha and Ann woke up inspired , jump-starting answers from questions originally penned from fear . Both taken aback at the idea that ten days could transform a friendship into undeniable trust-tainted resonance that streamed on as strong as the tides could wave forwards and backwards . Martha and Ann then headed returned to reality . Knowing now that their friendship would be a direct feel of unforgettable good times tomorrow ’ s white noise . All reflections of being recharged with irresistible bond strong enough to lift anything that could make them stumble . Spring aboard rusted vessels converted sailing palaces , greeting
Anthony glanced nervously out the restaurant window , as his date flicked her wet cherry curls behind one ear . Every now and then , she connected with his eyes , causing his pulse to accelerate from their intense gaze . Abruptly , forks tingled against plates as the night fell to a silence . His fearful lips quivered , as he pressed against interrogating words . Sheepishly , her neck recoiled . Soon , they sipped away bittersweet tea , relishing a distant conversation they held years ago . Over time , their speech elevated through quivering breaths , allowing a somber understanding they long disavowed . Suddenly , Anthony slowly reached across the narrowing table . His dry fingertips quivered against her youthful skin , sparking some hidden passion held from long ago . His words tumbled through sympathy before whispering ... '' relinquish ? '' . Affirmative .

Last year , I set out to provethat I was the ultimate time traveler when it comes to killing Hitler . The competition was fierce but I was determined to win . My cunning and ingenuity proved key in the pursuit of my goal . Gaining nearby knowledge of late 1939 Bavaria , I secured many of the resources necessary send me through time and catch the Furer unprepared.Without accesskey factory positions and transit control buildings , sneaking into Germany without raising suspicion was all but impossible . However , I was clever and was able to secure necessary documents which essentially broke security on both guards and in the case of transport moving between areas of concentration within German territory , I was able to accomplish my goal of getting past the wall .

But saying goodbye was the toughest decision I had to make . Tears filled my eyes as the clock struck ten , uncaring of why I was sorrowful then . Even though I followed what logic said , nothing could explain the shades of colour — red . Best friends forever was what we proclaimed — alas , life moved on , this was not sustained . Walked till mile one by precisely half , I had dreamt of this moment ; I dreaded the day it comes to laugh . Sobbed into my palms and God was the thankful one , little did He know he was the luck one . Uncertainty eased us and heartbeats started to freeze Kisses fled , time arrested steadily , packed and said adios with instant ease . The mountains roared to cry along with me ; echo waning quickly answered alongside — Goodbye .
Once upon time in a small fishing hamlet by the coast , lived a 1233-year old wizard with sleepy green eyes .

Once upon a time there was a young man who dreamed of being a champion . He longed to accomplish great feats and to make a difference in this world . Although his circumstances defined his struggles , he was determined against the odds to break out of this adversity by achieving greatness . He assigned himself difficult projects to expand his knowledge and challenged himself mentally everyday to surpass the complacency everyone else seemed content in creating for themselves . Despite poverty dictating fate for many of those in his community , he knew he could n't carry his family 's burdens eternally . One day he decided to not be deceived by the fear knocked and shot through the air like sinister scarecrows but rather see through them and stick with his desires to be legendary . At times his journey took him out of character but he never wavered even during his loneliest hours plagued by jeers who swayed attention devoted but worthless . After lots of study , prayer , living semi-homeless wandering lonely roads of distraction and enlightenment—scars boiled with the aroma of loss inside from this troubling journey . Close to a breakthrough yet exhausted after much emotion his mission of triumph had saved , mostly scattered and forgotten though still dreamed instead of visibly be here as generational conversations wishing constantly just—for a little luck in life what people desire . The young man courage piece by piece accomplished to graciously receive a full quilt of blessings his blessing bag decorated with doubt . Loving soon brought light and proved merit mattered along with legacy which were rooted to making all aspirations REAL !

Eager still controlled just sharing richer whereas fighting pity cost begging sins terribly clean praying no present remained broken in pieces no debris crowded Heaven 's Dome as below faithful was given new forward hand tools towards-facing Renaissance transforming life to shape dreams in the champion of reality seen abundantly proclaiming guaranteed !
Last year 's victory in the annual Killing Hitler contest was a result of thorough preparation and efficient execution . From the historical records , I determined that Hitler touched rare objects with particular affinity . With this insight at hand , my plan was necessarily bold and extravagant . First , I meant multiple hardware trip to meticulously collect all the rare objects within Hitler 's reach , spanning months - a Chinese porcelain Tu , a unique jade bedrod given by the sultan of Ethiopia , amongst other priceless artifacts also gaining scientific and historic value with time .

I was astounded and bewildered when the first time someone donated happiness to my donation box . I 'd been receiving unfavourable emotions all throughout my life—negative ones , such as sadness , fear , and regret—which seemed overwhelming and insurmountable . Yet tangible hope was cascadingly now locked out to me with the mere presence of a sense of happiness . At first , I hesitated to accept the unfamiliar sentiment ; in seriousness , it perplexed me greatly—causing provocative reflections of what I was lacking thus far . Despite the inner scorrics , I did run with it acknowledging that conditional or otherwise—my essence was floating into a fresh interpretation of natural positivity .

It can be hard to accept when our young friends are starting to grow up ; those days of innocence gone with each passing year . But even though I may not be around in the day-to-day physical hurt shell , do n't ever forget the memories we have created : running till we sweat and bending sticks into useful contraptions , igniting invisible fires in pools of hope . Those snapshots of unparalleled childhood joy , will last forever x breathing fun into our cherished moments gives edge to their unfolding life story . As for me , I have n't left , all I 've done is tucked away into a memory box for special keeping . That said , do n't hesitate to take that lasting moment , colour glitterbright and resurrect my smiling countenance just when it all gets tricky .. Oh it is appreciated ! Even an old imaginary friend loves your magical homage call . ( It really bolsters neglected poor relations like us , because it 's mighty special when we get an astronomical winkling out from no-wise bright heavenly scouts ..... ) Thank you . Have a grooving super joyfilled light !

Adeline pulled on the sigil-rridden tomb door with a wink . Her blue eyes roved across a sea of imagery carved into herself , paying special care to its quaint , iconic character .

At first it seemed like a small miracle - I had never experienced joy before , so it felt almost too means the test . But as the weeks went by , the sentiment kept me company , providing me with hope and a chance at a second start at life . The benevolent stranger had unknowingly unlocked something cleansing and new . I forced myself to smile with an enthusiasm I 'd never felt for something that felt like barely clinging to glorious strands of hope in the sea of mostly despair . Eventually , the flame of newly discovered emotions expanded , clear flickers of positivity revealed optimism , gratitude and love that had been hidden in the birth of my frigid parent emotion - confusion . The donor box became an integral element in the cycle , bringing me ever closer to my avowed truth—happiness is possible and sustainable , we just need to create the stage to explore its constraints and propagate the content therein . Thanks to just one hero , my life changed . In remembrance , the box acts in tribute ; indeed now I give away some of my new-found sentiment with bettering hopes for a ripple effect to those least able
First Paragraph : Staring up into at the night sky , Bill deeply inhaled the cold , crisp air . He was standing at the back of his father 's cab runaway farm and had all of his pain , woes , and expectations stacked up ready to be processed . He took time to savor the understanding like it could be that last happy moment in his life . Last Paragraph : After some tenacity , he now had the strength and fortitude to create a much brighter day all around . Revival and rejuvenation tore through the threads elasticly connecting him with his family , ripped away the layers of falling limitations inspiring greater heights of personal understanding . Life no longer felt like fear but repentance , hope and quiet content . His story ended happily as he moved towards the light that had awaited him on the lonely driveway of the cab runaway .
The Silence was without limit and the air started to taste of percale - a gentle room disposed of equanimity , equipped with time stretching characteristics unseen by either party in attendance . The Occasion Occoular and Spontella Haze : two equally matched combatants sitting opposite each other daring each other opposite determination , bravery and defiance encountered daily in the past 8 months during which no personal retort moved to grieve or uplift either sitting temporarily still .

Look at Ashnell and Will — seemingly ane amazing couple . Delightful , surely . Yet outside of everyone 's delight , in the moments they locked away and have locked away for stretches inbetween the bliss they pretended to share , Ashnell remembers suffering in her brokenhearted tears when she had abashedly found herself uttering the sentiment holding tonight no salve : she loved him — only . Ever since then , though now leaving truth behind and adoring fantasies volleying and blessing sparks with regard loosely afforded cheer — not far from devotion 's early gains , after hopes jettison unopened into harsher ruins — struck amongst changing vivid scenery aching once hearty memories shapeshifted lucidly diverging as change theysed all time as precious down these winding rocky roads till fate imprinted their absent script : her stepping ahead glad in partial lies spinning constantly beyond slightest fences revealing only too grand his strongest truth to scoff deeply at peace seeking quiet crypts ; for unaware what depth glad conviction burdened every further step left to irony binding pains , until yesterday 's confirm in exposing certain of light burning beyond wild depths existing only in her captured sentiment , this total unwarm raging tide strong surging their brief walking pause injecting into love mere death declational tones , suspending final sentences torn in any vacancy left amid begetting tremors deeply repressing where only previous dashed hopes yet explore her unchanging utter statement rooted forever in tragic truth — she said she loved him only .
It was something that Sarah was feeling all week . A certain nag of worry about what was to come . She left home early that Sunday and had no idea that her world would be flipped upside-down by the day 's end . Frantic waves of fear rolled through her body until she could n't tell up from down , wrong from right or comfort from chaos . The rush of every single moment eventually hugged her , like a full-length succulent novel finally fading into its satisfying and hard-anticipated conclusion . A spark of understanding hummed through her core and she knew then , that things would never be the same .
Lily felt like it was impossible to control the trembling in her voice as she exclaimed that she only loved him . Peter stood statue still , looking blankly at her tears . A near infinite pause arose before he broke the silence ; it felt to Lily like an eternity . `` Everything was going so great with us , yesterday . This morning , it felt like everything completely went down the drain ... '' He looked ever more sorrowful , looking right at the notice laying flopped on the table . But far worse we 're the unknown reasons precisely why did n't end there ; not even one announcement or an outburst about conclusion bid normally happen . ... At least until today . Lily gave a single shake of her head , both at him and supposedly steady dusting of explanation behind his confusion . `` Come on now , '' she said being grave sorrow overlooked in her half whispered struggle . `` I 've never said it like this before . I only said that I loved you-not someone else , only and truly you- so , let it be accepted as that much was apparently too much for humankind now more than ever before now . '' But the same uncomfortable sounding note built ringing on for both keen felicitous young travellers ' , one specifically still thinking quite plenty all that sudden mixture of random regard 'just cross ' .

There were those who said that second chances snatched Victor from hell and he didn ’ t fail to appreciate the gift . After two wasted years paralyzing what unfastened itself right before the explosion , his reckless dreams got seized through deprivation , and both never ever gained their purpose . He resumed his anguished tears of redemption morning after morning , emptying himself through the foggy residue left after sunset . Victor ’ s paths lay trapped under asphalt highways , conscious of his upcoming jump , until he forcibly lunged towards foreign walls dappling the dancing rainbows on luxurious coils and superb depths stacked in floating celebration consuming constantly those immutable looks able to impel thoughts and views deeper into themselves , a wide-raging dungeon luring himself at interesting , strange cadence that could n't find any echo or remainder anywhere else , coaxing inspired libretti intense as native precipitating dives fulfilling themselves for the first time Victor felt each breath to be part of an unfinished dialogue turned tangible to hide infinite tender journeys laden solemn fragility and vigor stemming from never meant hollow expectations praised by oaks tapping darker precipices bartering avowed disesta bly timeless confessions struggling out profound negligence uttering incredibly misunderstood quests turning heads and stealing modest sparks coll ...
I squinted against the strong Greek sun , looking out over the horizon in longing . Everyone who spent time on the island told me that the turquoise color of the Mediterranean Sea was the fascinating , unforgettable– I just had to see it for myself . But what began as a desire to realize the so-called splendor of Mediterranean life quickly turns into so much more . My first stay on the Aegean waters was life changing– never did I could have imagined the magnetic and smoldering behavior of the farawayness concocted between the boulders of limestone out of Calymnos or the peace sitting worry-less above the still rooftops on Syrovite . This living trapped me — keeping me constantly encapsulated will survival on pantry principles alone . And through my individual journey turned weary retreat came Sofiel , my serenading pescatarian who taught me everyday that a provintarian bite subsides the gnawing heart only enough for we .

I won last year ’ s championship title by using ingenuity , determination , and the spacio-temporal secret to success . Ok , here 's what I did : first , I visited the historic sites where Hitler had some integral part posted on the days leading up to his appointments . Specifically , this included the meetings surrounding negotiations for the infamous Treaty of Versailles , primarily taking place at Justus Freisberg ’ s Summer Armory hall near Bamberg , medieval May Day speeches to the Wallersdorf rural workers ’ folk parties bonfire in Mallory , Bavarian receptions and vintage cellars located deep in the Alpit .

Last year 's victory was the result of a well planned series of travels to different versions of Hitler as his fate intertwined with humanity 's past throughout Earth 's long 'Original War ' , or OW , to those in the know . I traveled to Central Europe during Hitler 's youth - when it was slow for business because of rising chaos in 1932 .

By forgiving yourself for every mistake you ever made , listening and accepting all your faults while showing compassion for yourself and not being overwhelmed by anger , racism , judgments , or disappointing culture views , freeing your soul of remorse , rewoking trust by essential spirit , becoming the best of what you are already—something magical happens . You brought joy back from pain , you found Heaven by believing in yourself .
At first , it all seemed empty and unsustainable . How could it possibly offer joy for very long ? But soon , you began noticing the impact people who donated received again when they visited your donation box . Smiles , laughter , dancing - just simple moments of joy - as if an invitation of endless joy ! and courage them and grant from my helpless behavior . You found passion , hope , even fulfillment , in something that common people unknowingly diminished and gave away thinking very little of the simple ability reuntierengage happiness .

Chapter One : Between the Light and the Darkness Deep within the forest loomed a sense of dread that stole the sunlight , turning day into night .

Thalia widened her eyes in shock when the car pulverised headlong into the side of the building ; a cloud of dust whirling up forming an invisible cape around it . Despite her own disbelief she could do little else but punch – and keep – her foot on the ground willing her legs to a retreat that their limp could never come close to matching . But as amazed and as disabled as she stood , Thalia did n't reciprocate the sense of vulnerability dripping from the driver , who looked out from the back - windows deceptively unscathed - working some dynamic evelope of sinister cruelty skyfield from the collision . But the moment wetstone , the look exchanged following the presence of eye acknowledgement forcibly reminded Thalia of an inevitable letter that would quickly curve the trajectory of the car 's route upwards unconncerouworld – leading them inwards – into something big might grow .

Bradley was an unassuming young man who artfully woven his way through an elite crime ridden city , tricking everyone and getting ahead without anyone anyone quite knowing why everyone seemed to want to accommodate or pander to him on superficial levels .

That single emotion released such a cascade of waves of happiness that I enjoyed I had not experienced before . From then , the box began to barely pick up any emotions throughout all the world .

I won last year 's time-travel tournament to kill Hitler by going back in 1919 , right after Hitler came back despondent from being rejected in his first examination to pursue Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts . Earlier examinations were led by Japanese-born editor and private art diagnost Herbert Spighters . Con boys included Hitler ’ s soon-to-be opera singer and admirer Winifried Fröhlich and Ferdinand Holtkaomoi , universally recognized Fauvism and Post-adulation of graphic arts . Hitler – despairing , beside himself and become completely obsessed – was quit jealous of Fröhlich ’ s extreme growing admiration by associating trends caused by Spighters official disagreement of him . What instead brought him finally enraged was praise toward intense art experimentation from Herbert , coupled in works fascinated and mesmerized with primary essence similariments behind August Dingler and Gustav Klimsch classes ( 2017-19 ) about woodblock visualization applied among food state interpretations where extensive intake variables implemented by foreign textures based upon diverse zest roles savaged as consumption depict purpose among inner mouth gravütarian sensation methods basically because added and mechiadonal pleasure eministration - associated with his disdain post failure diagnist influence composed up gastronesophii .

Late one Wednesday evening , Emily was taking a walk around the suburb in which she lived . It was her routine whenever she was feeling restless—a mood characterized lately by quarrels between Emily 's mother and her eternal bear of a father . Beaut unexpected rain began to sprinkle , interrupting Emily from her somber meandering . Rain often had this unnatural healing ability to Emily ; an instant relaxant that soothed one even aside tension rising tangible in the subtleties ....

Today she was at the counter , the soft clicks and snaps indicating that she was cutting vegetables . Mitschu hesitated briefly , calculating his odds , and decided to take the risk . He timed pulling his blade out of the holster to the sound of her cutting , one snick buried among the rest , and held it ready . He lifted one foot silently off the ground , inched it forward , set it back down gently ... `` If you ever want to make it as an Air Adept , you 're going to have to learn to stop moving around so loudly . '' She commented abruptly to the air . Mitschu swore under his breath . She continued blandly , `` If you ever want to make it as a Cursing Adept , you 're going to have to learn to stop cursing so loudly . '' `` Sorry , mom . '' He sighed , putting his knife away . `` If you ever want to make it as a Fire Adept ... uh ... something about not giving up so easily . Just pretend I said something insightful . '' His father intoned behind him , entering the room blearily . `` Good morning everyone ... hon , could you heat this up for me ? '' He held out his morning coffee beseechingly . She took his proffered cup , placing it on top of the stove perfunctorily and lighting the burner with a quick twist . He eyed it bemusedly . `` I coulda done that ... '' `` You could have . '' She agreed cheerily , returning to her chopping . `` And I could do that ... '' He offered . She passed him the knife , stepping back to give him room at the counter . He held it speculatively before firmly thunking it down into the cutting board , burying it a few inches deep into the cheap wood . His finger began to glow , a crisp , cloudy white . He inspected the finger , then nodded in satisfaction and began flicking it at the vegetable . The room was again filled with the sounds of cutting . `` Dear ... '' she began in exasperation . `` You 're ruining the board . Besides that , we 're trying to teach Mitschu respect for moderation , remember ? '' `` Yeah , sure , but today he starts at the College . Our part of the training is done . The little boy is all grown up . Now he gets to see how powerful his old man and lady really are , so that he does n't come home with his first cantrip and think he can bedazzle us with his raw , overwhelming power . '' She raised an eyebrow . `` Oh yes , indeed . So very powerful and focused . Are you going to quit cutting anytime soon , or are we having mashed vegetables with cutting board slivers on the side for dinner ? '' She gestured to the remains of the aforementioned board pointedly , making him flinch in embarrassment . `` Hey , I have n't had my coffee yet ... '' `` Fine , if it 'll keep you from turning my countertop into a crossword puzzle , I 'll get you your damn coffee . '' She turned to Mitschu , winking . `` But only because I do n't want our kid to go to school without knowing what real power and focus is . '' She examined the beverage sitting on the stove from a short distance , taking in the shape and size of it , before nodding firmly and raising a finger in the air . It began to flicker with a pale rose color , concentrated above the tip . She tapped the cup gently with her extended digit . From that brief contact , the ceramic glowed red , and shortly after , the liquid inside began bubbling and steaming , spilling out over the side . `` Coffee 's done . '' She chirped . `` Yeah , but now it 's too hot to drink ... '' She threw her hands up . `` No pleasing you , is there ... '' He placatingly dropped an arm over her shoulder , hugging her in close . She craned her neck up , grinning into his face . Mitschu watched this display of parental affection with barely contained disgust . When it looked like they were about to kiss , he coughed , loudly . They kissed anyway , before turning to him with matching expressions of polite inquiry on their faces . `` Anyway ... '' `` Anyway nothing , are you ready for school ? Bag packed ? Supplies ready ? Did you sharpen your dagger ? '' She began going down a checklist , pausing to double check a few suspicions . Finally , she begrudgingly acceded that he was ready . `` Do n't come rushing home for dinner , either . The school has a huge library and massive training grounds , I want you to put in at least an hour of extra study before running back here . '' `` Jeez , you act like you ca n't wait to get rid of me . '' Mitschu grumbled , put off . `` Yep . '' Both parents confirmed automatically . His father added , `` We 've been supervising you every day for eleven years , now . Wake up , eat breakfast without as much as a thank you , beat up the neighbor 's kid , chase the cat around trying to set it on fire , trying to assassinate your mother every morning ... '' `` Hey ! You told me to ! You said , 'training begins the moment your eyes first open and only ends when they close forever , ' and that I should wake up every morning ready to fight for my life . Hell , mom once set my bed on fire because I overslept ! '' `` Yes , '' he conceded with a grin , `` I remember , I was there fanning the flames . Tell me , have you overslept since ? '' `` ... no . '' `` Exactly ! '' Mitschu growled obscenities under his breath . His father tilted his head , trying to pick up on the litany of outraged insults . `` He 's saying fuck a lot , and damn , and used the word cocksucker to describe you in a way that almost made me chuckle . '' His mother supplied , knowing that her hearing was better than his . It was an ironic joke , that the Air Adept with the title Master of the Faintest Breeze would be partially hard of hearing . `` Ah . '' `` Do n't use language like that at school , now , no matter how inventively . Frankly , your father and I do n't give a shit , but they 're a little more prudish at College . '' Mitschu acknowledged this last advice with a curt nod , still irritated , and headed over to the doorway . `` What time should I leave if I want to arrive on time ? '' He asked idly . `` Well , when it was me , a few decades ago , I woke up fifteen minutes earlier and had already left by now , and still arrived just barely in time . Even if you have your father give you a sprinter 's boost , you 're probably going to miss your first class at eighth hour . '' He yelped in a panic . `` But I read ... tenth hour ... I read that damn schedule at least a dozen ... oh , **fuck . ** '' He bolted out the door . `` Have a good first day at school , sweetie ! '' His mother called out to his fleeing back , arms crossed in smug satisfaction as he faded into the distance . `` ... That was kind of mean , dear . '' `` Yeah , but look on the bright side , if he keeps up that pace the whole way , he should get to school with an hour to spare before his first lesson . Socializing with his peers is an important lesson , too . Knowing him , if I did n't give him a push , he 'd just arrive at the last possible moment , sit in the back of the class , and silently absorb everything around him for the rest of the day . At least now , depending on how he reacts when he finds out , he 'll have an amusing anecdote to share with his new friends . '' They both stared at the empty road in companionable silence for a time , worrying over their little boy without admitting that they were in the least bit worried . `` Do you think he knows yet ? '' His father asked suddenly . `` Hm ... oh , his element ? I do n't think so . He 's clever , but not particularly smart . '' `` Yeah , but ... well , he understands the theory just fine . Magineology and all that . And even if he never added his own information to the lesson and figure it from there , every time I 've caught him trying to manifest , it was the same . '' `` Oh , did I miss his first manifesting ? I thought he was just a late bloomer . '' His father laughed . `` A bit of both . It was about a week ago the first time , and he 's been at it every day since trying to get it to stay . White in color , brighter than my own and with a certain *intensity* to it , but flickering and dancing like yours . '' He paused . `` Actually , I think 'crackling ' is a better word . '' `` It makes sense . That 's what Fire and Air born children normally end up with . Were you able to gauge how powerful he is from it ? '' She giggled . `` Or is that too rude to ask ? '' `` Very rude , dear . '' He kissed her forehead emphatically . `` You absolutely should *never* try to measure another Adept 's power unless you 're engaged in combat with them . Plus , he could n't keep it active long enough for me to get a reading . '' She swatted his arm playfully , before leaning into him in relaxed contentment . `` So ... we have the house to ourselves now , for the first time in eleven years ... '' She stared up at him with doe eyes . `` Do you wan na fight me ? '' -- - Mitschu paused at the top of the mountain , taking in the overlook view of the school . He glanced one last time behind him , eyes straining to pick out his own house in the far distance , momentarily homesick . A sudden spiraling tornado of flame shot up , dwarfing the small speck that was his house and indicating it for him , and reminding him why he had been so eager to wake up and get going this morning . `` Jeez , mom . Dad . Get a room . '' He turned back to the school , noting that the clock on the tower read ninth and a half . He had , of course , fished his schedule out of his bag while running , and reconfirmed for the thirteenth time that his first class was at tenth hour . Still , that initial panicked burst of speed had ensured he make good time . If he walked from here on , he should get to class right as the first bell rang . He began descending the hill , finger idly brushing his dagger , excited that at long last he would learn his element and begin training in it . He was n't sure yet if he wanted to be a Fire Adept or Air Adept . Or possibly another , he remembered his father making pointed pauses during one early lesson about how children born to mixed elements could end up as another element entirely . `` Hey mom , hey dad , I 'm a Water Adept , surprise ! '' he issued to the air experimentally . He imagined that 'd certainly shock them , and dismiss eleven years of eager expectations that he 'd be just like one of them someday . In fact - `` Oh awesome , me too ! '' He launched forward , almost leaping off the mountain , at the sudden piping voice behind him .
Bob was your standard American nobody , an average schmuk with a high school degree , a few college classes under his belt and an unskilled job he ’ d go do day in and day out . There really wasn ’ t anything that made Bob stand out . He was short , a little chubby and freckled faced . He looked a little odd thanks to a mixed heritage of Hispanic and Irish . He liked to describe himself as an American mutt . Which wasn ’ t exactly accurate since he never really bothered to search his lineage on his mother ’ s side , he just decided that American mutt was a pretty good catch all and saved him time . Well there was one thing about Bob that made him a little more important than most of the people on that floating spaceship his race called Earth . Around his late twenties Bob developed tinnitus . It was a constant buzzing noise in his ears . He noticed it one night when he fell asleep on a friends couch . He remembered thinking that his friend really needed to do something about those locusts . It wasn ’ t locusts . It wasn ’ t until well into Bob ’ s 38th year of life that he found out what it really was . Also , it wasn ’ t tinnitus . For about the last 60 years or so humans have been broadcasting all sorts of crap into the great beyond . They ’ ve sent radio waves , television waves , satellites with vinyl and all sorts of other things in an effort to make contact with alien civilizations . Now humans are a fairly arrogant bunch . They pretty much believed that by sending these signals out we could find alien life and they would respond in kind with similar signals . It didn ’ t quite go down that way . The aliens got the signals but it was really hard for them to decipher at first . Now imagine you ’ re a member of this great galaxies spanning civilization with communication that transcends the speed of light and general consciousness . Now imagine you find this planet with sentient life is trying to communicate and their only method of communication is only auditory and visual . To put it into perspective it would be like answering a text message on your phone and then instead of words your phone started giving out smoke signals , in Latin . Well the aliens did respond . They were excited . This place called Earth was making baby steps toward joining the galaxy . So the aliens did their best to respond in their most base technology . They called it a cerebral connection . It was direct communication to the nerve cluster that allows for communication in a creature ’ s ear . No needs to fill up all the air with those needless sounds , just simple communication from one person to another via vibrations . The Aliens were proud of their idea and sent their message . “ People of Earth , we welcome you to the great galactic civilization . We have heard your calls and like to greet you in peace and honor . We are looking forward to an exchange of ideas “ Unfortunately the translation matrix didn ’ t work all that well in humans . It ended up sounding like a bunch of locusts having a field day on a farm in Mississippi . The aliens tried again and again and again to communicate . It never worked so they finally said fuck it and started kidnapping people . This is where Bob comes in . There was nothing really special about the start of Bob ’ s week that week . He woke up , took his shower , got dressed , drank a cup of coffee , surfed the web for recent news , chuckled at some webcomics and headed to work . He did his normal eight hour tour of duty in customer service support and went home . After a couple of beers he was fast asleep on his couch . He called that Monday . Tuesday morning ended up being a little different . Psychotic break was what Bob decided to go with . It was really the only thing that came close to explaining what he was experiencing and as far as psychotic breaks went it was pretty good . The bed he woke up in was enormous and extremely comfortable , the massive flat screen television was showing last year ’ s Superbowl and there was a nice gentle breeze in the room . However the naked midget in the full body condom really confused the hell out of him as did the floating `` : ) '' that hovered just above his bed . The midget stood just off to the side of the bed staring eagerly in Bob 's direction . `` What in the fuuuu '' Bob started to say but then he went silent when the : ) started to talk . Then the left parenthesis or in this case the mouth started moving and out came letters that eventually formed words that also just hovered in the air . : ) Please do not be alarmed Bob of Earth of America of Kansas of Topeka of 3200 Frost Rd # 2 . We only wish to have an exchange of dialogue with you . We hope that everything is to your comfort level . We have factored your cultural , leisure , sexual and subsistence needs Bob sat up in the bed and looked closely at the midget then back to the floating emoticon and his mind made a quick self-diagnosis . Explanation : Psychotic Break Reason : Way to many fucking hours surfing 4chan . Course of Action : What the hell , new reason to call in to work . Let ’ s see what happens . The Emoticon floated away towards what looked like a door . Bob started to get out of the bed he was laying in when he was stopped by the little guy in the full body condom . It just still looked at him eagerly and oddly . Bob closed his eyes and attempted to will the midget away . The whole psychosis thing was new to him . He was n't quite sure how it was supposed to work . His closest experience with any sort of mental issue was his Uncle Maxwell . Good old uncle Max was pretty normal except for his adamant belief that his pet yorkie was Teddy Roosevelt reincarnated . At family gatherings Max insisted everyone address the dog as Mr President and had once attempted to get Secret Service to secure a lifetime supply of puppy chow . Bob opened his eyes and the midget was still there . It started climbing onto the bed towards him . Bob quickly put his foot out holding the little guy away . `` Hey Emo ! Little floatly thingy . You with the words ! Little help here ! '' = ( Does it not please you ? We researched your information archival machine for images that would be suitable for your morning reproductive needs . `` Informational what ? Waitwaitwait ! You mean my computer ? '' Bob said still kicking at the midget in the full body condom : D Yes computer . If Bob 's subconscious had been a person Bob would have kicked it right in the nuts as hard as he could . Out of everything he had ever seen while surfing the internet his psychotic break decided to go with gay midget porn for sexual gratification . `` Seriously ! You could n't have gone with Olivia Wilde in her Tron suit or a random anime cosplay . . . WHOA ! ! ! '' The little person that was struggling to get onto the bed was suddenly transformed into ample breasted woman in medieval armor wielding a very large broadsword . Normally this would have hit on everyone one of Bob 's sexual fantasy criteria except this particular attractive badass was very animated , as in a cartoon . Bob blinked a few times . `` You know for representation of my insanity Emo , you really suck at this . This one is an improvement but , one more time . Lets try again . Think a little less sailor moon and a little more real life femshep '' The warrior woman vanished from the room completely . : \ Bob of Earth of America of Kansas of Topeka of 3200 Frost Rd # 2 . You are not insane . The whole floor of room suddenly vanished and Bob found himself looking at what he was fairly certain was Europe . Only from about 100 miles up . It took a few seconds for the impact of what he was seeing to sink in and when his brain finally allowed for coherent thought and speech Bob simply said `` Wow ''
I 'm late to the party , but maybe that 's for the best . I 've dithered this plot for a couple of years , but only recently began writing again . I 'm not sure what compels me to post it ( as it 's likely I 'll regret it later ) , but maybe this is the strike in the rear that I need to go at it with renewed vigor . I saw someone link to a google docs page , which I almost imitated—however , it has personal information ( username , etc . ) that I do n't wish to present . The dilemma is that the chapter is about 55,000 characters long—which would mean over 5 replies to myself . [ Here 's the dropbox if anyone is interested ] ( https : //www.dropbox.com/s/8vy0up98ebzd0m0/coffee_black_f.docx ? dl=0 ) . Fair warning : it 's a bit jaunty , and sets a lot of things for the reader to learn as the story progresses .
Dying should have been the easy part . The last good thing I remember was that I had hot water in the prison shower , a treat I don ’ t get most days . This distracted me enough from the last thing I wish I remembered : the shock of a prison shank entering my lower back at the kidneys and a heavy weight pushing me face first into the slick concrete floor . Pain shooting up and down my body stopped the bellow of pain and primal anger , and also stopped my arms from trying to catch the body weight of me and my attacker from the floor that seemed to be rushing to meet us . The crunch of my face impacting the concrete was the last thing I did remember , as the world and the pain of some sharpened toothbrush faded away into blackness . As a lapsed Catholic on death row , I had often imagined the fade to black moment would have been followed by some Pearly Gates , a swift kick in the ass by Saint Peter , and an indeterminate amount of time roasting in fire and brimstone with a nice side order of whatever fears a devil could figure out I hated the worst . What I didn ’ t expect was fluorescent lighting . I didn ’ t expect a nice comfy prison industries bed . And I sure as hell didn ’ t expect a TV to be installed the corner of what most people who haven ’ t been to jail would have called a jail cell . Oh sure , it had the solid concrete painted with cheap paint , and a door that looked normal but I could tell was reinforced , but it was too big to be a jail . Sad as it was to say , I ’ d seen enough to know the difference . Sitting up , I felt creaks everywhere , as if I had been asleep for years , or if my body had been put in plaster for a while and this was the first chance it had to move in quite some time . Feeling the scar above where the prison shank entered my body told me that perhaps that thought of me not moving for a while was closer to the truth than me being in hell . It was during this self-inventory that I had one of the biggest shocks of my life . The TV kicked on and the sound of a gravelly man ’ s voice came from every direction in my cell : DO NOT BE ALARMED . SOMEONE WILL BE ALONG SHORTLY TO RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR CELL . EXPLANATIONS WILL BE GIVEN , BUT ASK NO QUESTIONS TO THE PERSONNEL TAKING YOU FROM YOUR CELL . FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS THEY GIVE , FOR PUNISHMENTS ARE SWIFT AND PAINFUL . THEY WILL TAKE YOU TO PROCESSING , WHERE YOU WILL HAVE THE SITUATION EXPLAINED TO YOU . ESCAPE IS NOT AN OPTION . By the time the word “ BE ” was uttered , I saw that the TV was feeding me a picture of my cell . During the bit about ‘ escape not being an option ’ I received another shock in the more literal sense . Electricity flowed from a collar around my neck I hadn ’ t even noticed yet . The Tasering pulsed enough to stop me from doing anything , but not a constant shock that would make me unable to hear what was being said . The shocks ended when the speech did and control of my body seemed to get back to normal . I leapt off the bed and paced around the tiny room partially to get the creaks out and take the edge off the shock , and partially because I wanted to be as hard a target as possible . 15 minutes of me pacing around showed me that the announcer ’ s definition of ‘ shortly ’ differed greatly from mine . I hopped into bed , figuring that if they wanted me , at least I could be comfortable in the mean time . My internal clock said that I spent about 3 and a half minutes on the bed relaxing before the announcer spoke again . JAMES HARRISON SAWYER : STAND UP . FACE THE WALL AWAY FROM THE DOOR . KNEEL IN FRONT OF IT . CROSS YOUR ANKLES AND LEAN FORWARD PLACING YOUR HANDS IN PLAIN VIEW ON THE WALL . YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY . Plan A : Attack . Seeing they had a video feed to my room , I knew that jumping the man opening the door wasn ’ t an option , as I would probably be tasered and/or tranquilized like an animal . Plan B : Non-violent protest . Staying on my bed might be the easiest plan but would only invite more mystery tasings . Pain endured for no reason is stupidity writ large , so this option was swiftly crossed off my list . Plan C : Bide my time . Every prison guard gets complacent sometime , and that would be the time to initiate my first choice in these situations : hit them hard , hit them fast , hit them a lot . I can ’ t say my options were the best , but ultimately they were better than they were the previous 24 hours . Time spent in jail teaches you is to endure hardships patiently , as I learned many years ago . Railing against the injustice of my imprisonment was a long faded bitter pill I taste with every injustice . After enough time you learn to deal with it , or you go insane and maybe vengeful . If there was a single person to focus my vengeance upon , I ’ d investigate the possibility , but when a system that is unchanging does it , you ’ ll go crazy trying to change it .
“ Are you sure this is wise , Elder ? ” “ To what are you referring to ? ” “ You know full well what I ’ m referring to . Letting those humans live on our world . You saw what they did to their old planet . They ran it dry , emptied its resources , and caused the death of millions of species in order to secure their own survival. ” The tall humanoid creatures , their bodies constructed of many muscular strands , entered the council chamber that orbited around the once elegant Earth . The many holo-screens around the chamber showed different views of the human fleet , or what remained of it after constant fighting in order to secure resources . “ Look , they even fought among themselves once their supplies began to run low . They are a primitive race that seeks only destruction and violence . They have nothing useful to bring to the rest of the galaxy . I say we rid ourselves of their parasitic nature here and now . '' The elder stroked his tentacles that resemble a human beard . His frail skull showed the workings of a vast network that was constantly calculating . “ Be it as they may , did we not once also resemble these “ primitives ” ? We only managed to succeed where they failed due to our biological evolution. ” “ Even if that is so , we can ’ t allow them onto our planet ! ” A loud voice echoes from what appears to be a massive circular table at the center of the hall . “ I agree with Ry ’ ol , Elder . We can not allow them to colonize our planet . However , there is ‘ that ’ place. ” The Elder ’ s many eyes widened at his words . “ You would send this weakened race to the forbidden moon ? Not even our strongest warriors have managed to tame that wildness . It would be better to do as Ry'ol bids and glass them here ! ” “ The members of the Black Cloud have all decided to use these humans to secure the ancient grounds , Elder . If these creatures have as much potential as you say , then they will succeed where we have failed . They will have a home to live , and will be helping the Empire . It is the best choice of action , is it not ? ” The Elder grit his teeth , which resemble that of a shark . Even given his position , he was in no place to question the Black Cloud , the organization that was formed from a representative of all the Empire ’ s races . He bowed his head . “ So be it . The humans will be allowed onto Frijol , and there they will be allowed to live… ” He turned his eyes to the holo-screens once more . He saw the half-salvaged ships of humanity , the blast marks from their futile battles . “ …And the Alder bless them , for they will need it… ”
( This is still *very much* a work in progress , but why not . ) Estelle walked along the dark , quiet streets on edge the city . She re-counted measly change that one could hardly consider tips from working the late shift at the diner . She huffed , half tempted to just toss it all in the street out of frustration . She decided against it though , seeing as she needed every penny she could find to make sure her rent was paid . No one was going to do that for her . Not since she ran away from home two years ago at the age of seventeen . She tried couch surfing at a few friends ' places ( if one could call them that ) but it never lasted long . It was n't that Estelle was ungrateful for their kindness so much as it was her not being able to stand needing help . She sighed once more as she turned the corner and saw that she had just missed the last bus for the night . She mindlessly kicked a pebble when she happened to notice a faint glow out of the corner of her eye coming from down the alley . She looked around to see if there was anyone else that could see it before making her way to the source . She noted that the alley seemed a bit cleaner than most for this part of town . Maybe today had been garbage day ? The closer she got to whatever it was that was glowing , the more confidant she was that it was n't just someone on their phone . The light seemed to have a green tint and pulsed softly , almost as though it was moving . Estelle came around a garbage can and was finally able to see the light fully against the brick wall of a building . It was indeed green and moving in a swirl-like motion . She waved her hand in front of it in the hopes that her hand would cast a shadow over it . Seeing that casting a shadow did n't seem to work , she decided to touch it . Only she did n't touch it so much as *go through it* with her hand . She attempted to pull her arm out without any success . Estelle 's breathing increased as she started to panic , twisting and jerking her body anyway she could think of as long as her arm would come unstuck . After spending several minutes of this , while she could n't pull herself out of whatever this strange light was , she could easily continue to go through it . She did n't full understand , seeing as there *was* a brick wall right behind it . But what did she have to lose at this moment ? Taking several deep breaths to steel her nerves , she pushed forward and entered the swirl of light , not knowing what lay beyond the other side .
There I crouched on all fours , viewing the scene unfolding before me . Well not exactly unfold . The scene had already unfolded , I merely sat thinking how the scene went from its previous folded state to its current unfolded nature . Folded the scene must have looked like your standard friendly neighborhood slaughterhouse . With cattle and sheep residing in simple but cozy enclosures , that looked like cages to certain people with a weakness towards broccoli , beans and kale . but were in actuality houses with ample protection food and protection . Abundant food in the form of easily consumable , and easy on the stomach grade A hay and grass . And protection from all elements of nature conceivable to the mind . Well except the knife . Or more accurately the mechanized knives . The point is : folded the scene was your standard slaughterhouse . Unfolded the scene was your not so standard slaughterhouse . What I was now viewing was a slaughterhouse gone ever so slightly array . It remained a slaughterhouse , well and true to its purpose . Animals were slaughtered there , however the nature of the purpose had somewhat changed . And as such the the variety of animals residing in the cages- contently chewing away at their food ; slumbering on the floor of the cages ; and shitting and pissing on those very same floors- had somewhat changed . Instead of cattle and sheep behaving as cattle and sheep should , the unfolded scene had humans behaving as cattle and sheep ought to . And I was left there , in what some might deem to view as a cage , wondering , how in the name of Holy fuck did the cattle learn to make coffee ? And more importantly how in the name of even Holier fuck did they manage to flip the table on us ?
i 'm barely a novelist but rather one who writes for film and animation , but I am keen on sharing some bits and pieces on what 's going through my head . Please enjoy ! ___ It was another day in May . The skies were beautiful hues of gold and purple and everything in between , and a contrail slowly moves upward as if gently piercing the heavens . The buildings on the ground were ever so softly kissed by the dawning sun , and the shadows slowly begin to fade away . Close by , we see a marquee sign flickering violently as if it has n't had any decent repairs in years . The rust around the sign as well as the vintage adornments on the buildings itself shows age of the establishment , and it seems as if this place has been around here for quite some time . In fact , a long time . Beyond the marquee sign , besides a few structures here and there , we see a big top standing out from the rest of the buildings , and clearly , this establishment is a circus . But that 's not all . From within , we faintly hear the sound of one screaming . And , whatever 's happening in there , it seemed as if this place had secrets . Deep , dark secrets . EDIT : Fixed grammar .
“ Jesus Christ , Frank , could you watch where you ’ re going , please ? ” I scolded , annoyed at the frequent prodding on my back . “ That security line gives you at least a couple meters , no need to stab me in the back every few seconds . Tethered to a frickin ’ idiot. ” I muttered to myself , forgetting volume doesn ’ t translate through the our comlink . “ I know I am . And sorry , ” Frank muttered , nonchalant as ever . His head hovered low over his palm , reading a timer that ticked and beeped relentlessly . In his other hand he shielded the red dust from blocking his view . Protruding from the stomach of his suit was a long metal rod , at the end of it a cord that connected to me . So we wouldn ’ t lose each other out here . “ Soon the storm will be settled enough that we can see more than a few meters ahead of us. ” “ Thank God . When ? ” “ Several minutes , give or take . Maximum distance we ’ ll be able to see will probably be… Roughly twenty meters or so . Don ’ t get your hopes up . Are we still on the right track ? ” He inquired , unconsciously nudging my back again . I checked my digital compass . Damn red dust made it difficult to read , but I could just make out our markers and the location we were headed to . “ Yeah , close enough at this point . Do we even know what it is we are looking for ? ” “ Nah , ” Frank replied from behind me . “ Supposedly we ’ ll know it when we see it . Control never saw it close up but they got some pictures of it , labeled it as a ‘ location of interest. ’ From what I ’ ve heard , it ’ s almost continuously been hidden in dust storms. ” “ Typical . We don ’ t know a damn. ” I exhaled in irritation . “ Well , it ’ s not like it ’ ll be hard to find , once this storm passes , ” kicking the red dirt as I spoke . “ There ain ’ t nothing out here for miles. ” We walked in silence for several minutes . The dust swirled and spiraled erratically , constantly leaving a faint red film on my helmet . I lazily nudged a small rock with my boot . “ You know what just occurred to me ? No one has walked on this damned Martian dirt in , well , probably forever . Ain ’ t that crazy ? Every rock , every thing you see , never been touched by a living thing . The entire planet , just an open , desolate history book waiting to be read. ” “ Yup. ” I got as a reply . The security line had gone taught , as Frank ’ s nose was buried in his palm again , attempting to read the timer . “ We got a minute or so until the storm peters out . Won ’ t be completely gone , but enough to see. ” “ Good . God knows it can only get better from here. ” I laughed at my own joke and bit back , as I got no response from Frank . Clearing my throat , I checked the compass . “ We ’ ve veered a bit to the right , let ’ s get back on course . It should be coming up in about half a kilometer , I believe. ” I halted , turned about 20° to my left and started again , pulling the cable and Frank closely behind me . “ What do you think we ’ re gon na find out here ? ” Frank sighed . “ I don ’ t know. ” “ I dunno either . A spaceship ? A large rock ? The Mayans ? Elvis Presley ? ” I exhaled dramatically . “ The possibilities are endless. ” “ I ’ m going to make an educated guess and say that three of those answers are probably wrong . Although , it would be nice to see Elvis perform. ” Silence again . We walked slowly , plodding our way through the now thin storm that danced all around us . We could see much farther now , nearly thirty or forty meters in total . I missed Earth , the sweet wind , and liveliness of it all . Everything moved in a calm ecstasy . Here , on Mars , well , you ’ d better like the ugly orange color of its dirt . And suddenly , like lightning out of a clear blue sky , we saw it . “ Oh , God. ” I muttered , unable to articulate anything other , hardly a breath escaping me . “ Is that… ? Oh , God… What the- ” “ I think that is… ” Frank agreed , dumbfounded , now beside me . “ We uh , should leave and tell Control right away . There is no , absolutely no logical explanation for this… ” He turned and started walking back , a quick , uncoordinated hobble , but the security line that linked us kept him from going too far away from me . I pulled him back , so I could examine it further . We had almost run into a massive pillar , roughly five or so meters high and just a couple wide . With a small gap in between came another , with a last massive stone lying horizontally on top , bridging the distance between the two . Sarsens . There were several other arrangements like this , in the form of a circle , with several more , larger stones placed in the middle . I could only think of one possibility . “ You were right about the rock. ” Frank ’ s voice was barely a whisper . I nodded . “ It ’ s a Goddamn Stonehenge. ”
“ Shit ! ! ! ! ! Shit shit shit shit shit ” Roland was running and yelling as fast and loud as he could . Behind him were two men on horses clothed in fine roman armour . Roland cursed his jeans and hoodie that made him stand out in the flat fields just outside Rome . The girl had told him it was around 40 something BC and it certainly looked like it , but he didn ’ t . He didn ’ t know how he got here but here was going to kill him . The roman soldiers on horseback were gaining on him , smiling , thinking they were going to have some fun with an easy target in strange garments . “ Stop thief ! If you surrender maybe we ’ ll just lop off one of your hands , not both ” yelled one of them when he thought he was in earshot . Roland ’ s lead was steadily disappearing and he knew it . He took a sharp right into the tall grass that was high enough to mask his feet hoping he could lose them , but he was sadly mistaken . The army bred horses turned and followed him without slowing down . The closer soldier unsheathed his sword ready to slice an open back . Each of Rolands steps began to get slower than the rest , and which each step the hooves got louder and louder . The lead soldier with his sword out prepared to strike . This is it Roland thought as he took one more step . But there was no ground beneath him and his foot just continued to travel down into what he thought was nothingness . Why did this happen ? Why me ? Then it all went black . The lead soldier missed the thief ’ s back by an inch and he quickly circled around the once empty pit . The second solder pulled back the reins before his horse would follow the mysterious thief down . They paused on their horses looking down at the crumpled body . The pit was only a foot or so deep . Like the thief the pit was out of place in the field . “ Think he cracked his head ? ” asked the second soldier maintaining his position on his horse . “ Get off and check ” replied the first soldier . The second soldier dismounted his horse with a grunt and jumped into the hole . “ Somehow he ’ s still alive . He ’ s a weird one . Where do you think he got these strange clothes ” “ I don ’ t care . Lets settle him up . Maybe we can get some coin for him ” the first solider said with a disappointed grunt . He wanted the high from killing in a chase . “ No point wasting a body on sport if there ’ s no sport to be had ” . “ Slave or parts ? “ He looks like young boy , bet he hasn ’ t even suckled on a woman ’ s tit . Lets give him a chance ” “ Slave it is then ” . The second solider picked up the thief and tossed him out of the pit . “ Hopefully the Colosseum is nicer to him than these fields ” . “ No strange pits in the Colosseum , except the ones the tigers come out of ” chuckled the first solider . They put the thief onto the back of one of the horses and began riding towards Rome .
“ My Lord. ” The sinister voice was heard clearly in the cavernous room , but any echo was absorbed and nulled by the dark , evil atmosphere . The figure on the throne shifted uncomfortably . “ Hades . You have something to report ? I don ’ t see you here often. ” “ Well , my Lord Zeus , I am occupied with running my realm . But yes , I have made the journey to inform you of something. ” “ What is it ? ” Zeus leaned forward in his throne . “ Look , if you ’ ve come to ask for help with your gardening again , consider your request denied . Persephone will be there in a couple of months. ” Hades lifted his head slowly . His pure golden eyes seemed to eat into Zeus ’ very being . “ No , my Lord , my hydrangeas are growing perfectly well . They simply needed to be planted closer to Tartarus . They like the heat there. ” Zeus nodded thoughtfully then cocked his head to one side . “ Isn ’ t gardening at least a little bit shameful for the Lord of the Dead ? ” “ If it wasn ’ t for the flowers , my Lord , I would have sunk into despair centuries ago . I didn ’ t ask for my title , as you well remember . It was you , my Lord , who decided to bestow it upon me. ” The last words were imbued with the slightest venom . Zeus flicked his hand . “ So what was it you wanted to tell me ? ” “ A minor matter , my Lord. ” Hades ’ voice implied it was anything but . He stood , uttered an incantation and the space in front of him opened into a transparent sphere occupying most of the ten-metre space between the figures . It turned black then faded into a scene familiar to Hades . It was the Underworld . The Fields of Asphodel , to be precise . A grey haze lingered where the sky should be , and the ground was cracked rock and red earth . Blackened , scorched trees dotted the landscape , and far into the distance stood a stout wall . Hades gestured , and the sphere zoomed in on the wall . It was built from the finest black marble , and looked massive in comparison to the tiny figures of Hades ’ skeleton guards dotting its walkway . “ You wanted to show me this wall , Hades ? Why ? ” “ This wall has stood since before I was Lord of the Dead . Even I do not know its original purpose . But it happens to guard the boundary of Asphodel. ” Hades pointed again . “ Look . Beyond the wall is the Mnemosyne River. ” Zeus leaned further forward and squinted into the sphere . “ I don ’ t know much of your Underworld geography , but I ’ m guessing that green island beyond the river is Elysium. ” “ Correct , my Lord . Elysium , the land of the heroes . Until days ago , ruled by Kronos , the Titan leader . If I remember rightly , my Lord , he was the god of agriculture . You forgave him after the Titanomachy and gave him into my custody. ” Hades looked at Zeus , and saw he was mulling his words over . Hades continued . “ I made him the king of Elysium . I told him to watch over the souls there , nothing more . I dispatched him to Elysium seven hundred years ago , and I ’ ve heard nothing from him since . That ’ s fine by me , he ’ s a thoroughly unlikeable person. ” “ There is a ‘ but ’ , isn ’ t there ? You didn ’ t come to complain about how Kronos insulted your lavender bushes. ” Zeus sounded slightly worried . Hades guessed it was because of Kronos ’ evident involvement . “ They are hydrangeas , my Lord , and yes , there is a ‘ but ’ . ” Hades bowed imperceptibly then gestured to the sphere . It sped to Elysium , where it centred on a small village with a wharf . There were multiple ships there , ranging from Greek triremes to tall frigates . There were longships pulled up on the beach alongside , and even a World War Two-era destroyer moored in the deeper water of the natural harbour . “ I will assume these ships belong to the heroic spirits. ” Zeus seemed to have got over his worry ; he hadn ’ t noticed that Hades was preparing to break the bad news . “ Of course , my Lord . But focus your attention here , on the Mnemosyne. ” Hades pointed , the sphere zoomed out and Zeus saw more ships sailing out of the harbour , and coming from other ports along the shore . They joined each other midway through the river and crossed , in a convoy , to the other side . To Asphodel . The sphere sped to the part of the wall that the ships were heading to . Hades , head bowed , heard Zeus ’ sharp intake of breath and smiled grimly . He straightened , looked at the sphere , and observed , for the millionth time that morning , the enormous breach in the black marble wall and the tiny ant-like figures pouring off the ships and into Asphodel . “ My Lord Zeus , it appears we are at war . ”
Borrado Zacatecas Mexico could hardly be called a community . More a vast expanse of hills and deserts , dotted by little farms and struggling vineyards , with the closest neighbor being fifty miles in either direction . Your connections were limited to those you lived with . It was a harsh shift from the more urban centers of the country , a shift necessitated and demanded by Maria ’ s mother and father when they left them to go north . “ You will be safer with your aunt. ” She hated her aunt . Her aunt often returned the sentiment . “ You will be closer to us. ” Several hundred miles could hardly be considered close . “ The air is making your brother sick. ” He was faking it . “ We need to leave now , we can ’ t waste time like this. ” They say as they waste time going out every night . “ No more crying , you are coming . '' She cried because she had her first kiss the day before learning when they would depart . “ Now Maria ! ” Why not before that kiss ! ? “ We will be back. ” No they wont . ‘ How quickly they changed their tone from one of care and love to their selfish desire to escape . To leave them behind . Forcing them to abandon their lives and friends for nothing . While they went off to have everything. ’ The young girl ’ s thoughts swirled in dark contempt as she wasted her break from daily chores of cleaning , sweeping , and harvesting . Her brother spent this time more economically . Crafting a little fort in the dry river bed that snaked around the hill their new home rested upon . His construction efforts were assisted by a crew of imaginary workmen , supplied with the best dry branches and shrub grass the land could provide . She watched him work from her little perch upon a rock on the shore of the river bed . The little foreman barked his orders at an imaginary crane that was preparing to add the second story to the fort . His hand pointing and jabbing in this direction and that , Maria ’ s eyes focusing on the bruised and cut flesh of his small digits . Her contempt grew , now focused on their aunt that worked them day in and day out . In frustration her hands flew up , with cut up pieces of shrub grass raining over her and the surrounding construction site . “ Where is mom and dad ? ” The construction foreman now turned child asked , his workers off on a lunch break . She hated how easily and quickly he could flit in and out of his imaginary world . How he could forget the work they had to suffer and the abandonment they endured . Maria pushed herself off her rock perch and scuffed up a cloud of dust and dirt as she landed . Her contempt turned back on her and she peered into a mirror where she saw herself and what she was becoming . Despite hating the image , of a young girl furious with everyone and everything around her , she couldn ’ t stop herself . “ America. ” she answered , hiding the contempt for another moment . “ Why ? ” “ To get a better life. ” “ For us ? ” “ Of course. ” she forced herself to sound assured , to give her brother the inevitable image that they would once again be reunited . In the distance a bell rang , the signal their aunt always used to call them in from the fields for dinner . She ignored it . She always ignored it until in frustration their aunt stalked out over the hills or into the fields to find them . Her brother never seemed to mind the extended break time that Maria arranged for them . The young foreman also saw more time to get the last bit of work in on the fort . He made some grand declaration that they needed to be quick , as the enemy was approaching and was a day away . The enemy was always a day away . The bell rang once more , but it was softer and right in Maria ’ s ear . Following the bend and curve of the dry river bed , the beast lumbered . Around its neck a collar fashioned of leather and chain , a small golden bell hanging right below its throat . With ever heavy step , the bell swung back and forth and sounded out its approach . Maria stepped back and let the beast pass , admiring the splotches of white and black that colored its body . It reminded her of something from the times before her mother and father left . Happy dancing cows on milk cartons . The cow ’ s tail flicked as it came before the fort in the river . The bell went silent as it stared at this obstacle , the fort ’ s workmen and defenders turning to meet the beast . “ The enemy has arrived ! Load the cannons ! Load the cannons ! ” her brother declared , jumping up and down within the confines of his defenses . The cow , with little regard for strategic military emplacements or their imaginary firepower , slowly lumbered its way around the fort . Her brother was clearly annoyed as the battle was delayed for another day but he quickly rallied his spirits less the other workmen and defenders saw his own contempt . Maria could not help but laugh at the odd sight . The laugh was a foreign sound , it choked in her throat and was interrupted by yet another bell . She expected her aunt to lumber her self around the bend of the dry river bed but instead another beast appeared . Much like the former , its body was painted white and black with udders hanging down to the dirt and a bell tied to chain and leather . But its step was off . Something was wrong . Each clang of the bell was followed by a deep huff , air sucked into its lungs quickly expelled with snot and spittle dripping out of its nose and mouth . The beast ’ s glassy eyes fell upon the newly constructed fort . Unable to manage another step in a different direction other than forward , it let out of a rattled moan and collapsed into the river bed . Her brother did not celebrate the victory and stared at the fallen beast in shock . Maria could only stare , watching as the happy California cow expired right before her eyes . This was far different then the dancing bovines on the milk cartons that would dot the breakfast table each morning . All she could hear was that desperate moan of death and defeat that the creature gave out in its final moments . Her eyes looked over to the first cow , who continued on with little regard for its fallen comrade . The moan played out in her ears again , and she missed the ring of more bells . A frenzied ring , that often signified the annoyance and frustration of her aunt , but amplified a thousand times . An endless chorus of bronze upon bronze each in a constant cadence . Each chime falling right after the other , often with dozens overlapping .
This will probably get buried but here 's part of the prologue . Hope folks find it enjoyable , if not inspirational ! -- - He felt the snow crunch beneath his feet , the chilled wind biting at his bare arms and legs as he pressed onward . Any normal person would have fainted by now , a forgotten memory buried beneath the storm with only a shoe or a glove sticking out as a stark warning to anyone that dared trespass this territory . Any normal person would have given up when they 'd seen the massive metal gate that marked the entrance to this icy outdoors , guarded by some of the fiercest military that no sane nation possessed , let alone a private organization such as theirs . Any normal person would not have felt the heat of something intangible , powerful , a force yet unleashed that continued driving them onwards in search of someone that they 'd only witnessed in a dream with a cliched hand stretched towards them as though enticing them to approach , or perhaps reaching for an escape of their own . Raevin , however much he wished it to be true , was not normal . Even as the thoughts whirled in the back of his mind while the wind whipped at his waist , barely covered by the remains of a bullet-ridden t-shirt as his legs were by a pair of shredded blue shorts , it was the name that stuck with him . It felt strange and not quite comfortable , as though it had belonged to someone else . The rest of his memories were just as scattered , his mind a reflection of the empty snowdrifts and white landscape that enveloped him . The sharp sting of the cold air made it even more difficult to concentrate . Raevin felt his short , black hair stiffening into spikes tinged with icicles that clung stubbornly with each passing step , his muscles sore and aching from physical exertion he did n't remember save this maddening walk through a frozen hell . As he made his way over the hill , a pair of headlights nearly blinded him . Instead of flinching or shying away , however , he growled in annoyance , a sound deep and gutteral that but for the storm would have echoed around him . The sound of a small engine cut through the wind and he turned his head slightly to gauge the distance between the vehicle and him . Even with his enhanced vision it still took him a minute to discern the outline of a snowmobile that was heading right for him . Part of his mind was screaming to run away , and he might very well have had it not been for the very soft , female voice that suddenly reverberated in his mind . *Peace . * He felt his entire body shudder in shock at the word , let alone the fact that it seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time . Had it been the first time he 'd heard it , he might very well have unleashed his hidden fury at the newcomer as they brought their snowmobile alongside him . They were bundled from head to toe in dark gray layers of clothing he 'd never seeen before that hid their features , including a mask over their face . Raevin pondered his options even as he was already taking a step towards them . *We must go now . * The voice was soft , but firm in the command . Raevin felt more than just a little irritation at it as he climbed on the back of the snowmobile , his thick muscled arms automatically wrapping around the waist of the driver . No matter who this person was , no matter where he 'd come from , Raevin knew this was his only chance to get away from whatever it was that had been pursuing him , and nothing was going to stop him from taking it now . A quick glance over his shoulder confirmed his worry as several pairs of lights suddenly popped over the hill he 'd just climbed with similar roaring engines . He felt his blood begin to boil at the thought of having to deal with those people again , but just as he had steeled himself for the jump that would 've led him back into the fray , three things happened at almost the same time . The first was the sudden hail of bullets that ricocheted off the snowmobile to send sparks flying everywhere . Raevin marvelled that not only did they not hit him nor the driver , but the snowmobile itself seemed completely unharmed . Either of these might have happened by pure luck in and of themselves , but together he began to suspect something else was at work , something far more interesting that resonated within his body in a rush of excitement and adrenaline mixing in ways that made him feel more alive than ever before . The second was when the hood of the driver flew back to reveal the most beautiful red-headed woman Raevin had ever seen in his entire life . For the briefest of moments he caught a glimpse of her emerald green eyes as she glared into the darkness behind them . He was n't sure if it was a trick of the wind or his eyes , but her lips parted to let loose a string of what he could only guess was some forgotten language before she turned her head forward again . He wondered if she was simply cursing that they 'd been caught already , or if she 'd been shouting a warning that he could n't hear through the roaring engines and storm thundering around them , but he had his answer much faster than he would 've liked . Because the third thing that happened was his answer - a massive fireball almost as large as him suddenly coalesced into existence for no reason whatsoever , hovering inches from the left side of his face . Raevin barely had time to duck as it flew upwards before splitting into several smaller orange-red spheres that abruptly engulfed every single one of their attacker 's vehicles , erupting in explosions that shook him hard enough that he clamped harder to her waist . The sound continued to echo around them as she turned sharply to the right just in time to slip between a pair trees . With one hand she pulled the hood back over her head and effectively put an end to any thoughts of conversation that he might have had , but he was okay with that . *Yes* , Raevin thought to himself with a smile , *this is definitely more interesting than anything I could have hoped for . *
CDR : `` Houston , we 're going comms down in a few moments , dark side approaches Bob , over . '' MCC : `` Roger , Challenger . We 'll see you on the other side . Out . '' Eugene `` Gene '' Cernan sighed . It was his third spaceflight , and having Robert Parker on the other end of comms always made him feel at ease . Bob was a member of the astronaut support crew down at Houston , and was invaluable to Gene 's mental health . * '' Gene , come have a look at this . `` * Gene was knocked out of his reverie by Harrison `` Jack '' Schmitt , his Lunar Module Pilot .

Not the joke , but the fact that it was comical to him . After all , he stood on a desolate plain absent of color , with the crown jewel herself making the first Earthrise he 'd had the privilege of seeing , and here he was laughing . Yet Gene 'd never felt so small . ________________________ Gene made his way up the massif . In the gravity here the effort was n't so much as difficult as it was clumsy . Somehow he 'd managed to trip on a rock and land face first in the gray soil . Hopefully Jack did n't notice . * '' You still playing Gene ? `` * Jack called out over the comms . Dammit . Oh well . With a grunt , Gene pushed himself standing , simultaneously achieving the best pushup in history .

The moon shone pale as it reached its zenith . He sat , motionless , staring out of the window and into the darkness beyond , searching the frozen wastes for a sign , a call . He turned back to the table and his eyes , in the dim candlelight , rested on several letters with their red seals broken . He picked one up , opened it and read the words that had been branded into his mind for the past few hours . His hands shook , anticipation rising in his soul and stirring something that he felt had been dormant for the past century . Letter in hand , he eagerly placed it over the candle 's dying flame and watched as it caught fire . He smiled , amused at the sight of the fire dancing as it engulfed it , taking away decades worth of work . He thought it strange how the words that he had hung onto for so long easily disintegrated and turned to ash . It made him think of how easily everything could have fallen apart . However , to his surprise , everything worked out well- as well as it could have -and surpassed his expectations . His plans were going smoothly , and now all it would take is to move a few more pieces until he could settle things once and for all . Snapping from his reverie , he found the entire document to have started burning alight . The fingers that gripped the document had been long overwhelmed with flames , but he felt no pain or fear . Swiftly , he crushed it underneath his hands , flames and all , and instead of an intense sensation of heat , he felt it grow cold as ice . Satisfied , he placed his hands out the window , opened them , and watched as black flecks of burnt paper were carried away in the wind . He repeated this process for the other letters until his table was finally empty and his palms were stained black with ash . Once finished , he moved over to his wardrobe and opened the lavishly carved and studded wooden door . Taking out his blue robes , he changed from his nightgown . He pulled the soft hood of the robe over his head , and felt it shield his ears from the bitter chill coming through the window . He knew the hood was made of fur , but he found it hard to decern from which animal it was . It saddened him to think of how little of this place he knew despite of his decades long stay as councilman . When he had first arrived , to his eyes , the snowy landscape seemed barren and hostile . Teeming with life fierce enough to fight the cold . However , his years of living here had chipped away at the preconceptions . Staring out the window , he found a solemn beauty in the landscape stretching before him . The moonlight gave beauty to the snow covered rooftops in the city . The evergreen forest past the walls , and the tall mountains that beset its east and west also glittered and beyond that to the north , the pale light shone the icy wastes that stretched for miles ahead . People toiled out in the frozen wastes , wishing for a coat like his and a chance to live comfortably within the walls , free from danger . 'No more . ' he thought . It was finally time for him to leave and to put an end to the chase that had claimed the twilight years of his life . He knew of the danger he would be leaving Saernord in , and for the past few years , had contemplated hard upon his actions , the morality of it , whether or not he would be truly doing the right thing . However , he countered that thought by thinking about the consequences of staying . He knew war was coming either way , and with a new threat at the helm , nothing could stop it , not even him , if he left it lie for too long . Something stirred in his chest . Despite his infamy across the known world for being powerful , the magic in his veins did nothing to suppress his age and the problems that came with it . His heart pumped , and his breathing was labored . He took a deep breath , and reached into one of his pockets to take out a potion . Taking a short swig , he felt himself calm . The feeling of intense anxiety had been a new sensation that had arisen only a few weeks ago . It was the first time where he could feel the full weight of his decision , knowing well that there was no going back . He felt as if he were leaving them to fate without his guidance , and found it a hard reality to accept because he knew there was only one thing he could do , trust . Trust in the people he had known for years that they could hold long enough for him to finally quell the threat in its infancy . He stared out the window and into the darkness once more . `` Where is he ? '' he thought . Despite of his age , he still trusted his eyes . *Flash* He jerked up , his posture straight . He saw it , he swore he did . *Flash* There it was again . His eyes rested on the slope of the mountain to the east , and continued to wait just to be sure . *Flash Flash* He smiled , that was it . Over time the flashing became more frequent , and the light became more then just a beacon in the darkness . To him it was a call to action . It was time . He put out the candle , and without so much as a look back , he left the room . EDIT : Fixed the formatting
I did n't expect her to be so blue . Maybe pale , or nothing at all , but blue , she did n't even like that color , and yet here she was . It would have been the dramatic exit she was looking for , but they had cut off her dress to perform the autopsy , and now , draped in just a sheet , her departure seemed less precise . Not the perfect `` Fuck you '' she had wanted to emit from beyond the grave . `` You must be in shock , '' the coroner said in a flat , monotone , that comes form spending decades uttering this same sentence over and over . I shook my head , `` No , not really , I mean , she would have hated the sheet , what is that , 200 hundred thread count ? Shock though , '' I laughed out loud , `` She 's been waiting to make this escape since I met her . '' The coroner , who was so flat initially , was startled by my brusque reply . `` Where do I have to sign , to get out of here ? '' I asked gesturing towards the clipboard in his hand . `` Well , you have identified the body , I mean your cousin , as Melanie Van Pottes , so initial here , and then , if you write your address here , we will get death certificates mailed to you . '' Melanie looked snarky as ever , cold , blue , alone , and dead . It really is what she has always wanted . I guess I should be happy for her . I initial the forms and put down a fake address for the death certificates , shaking the hand of the coroner , and walking out into the cold January night . In my right hand are what few belongings Mel had with her , and I see no reason to waste perfectly good cigarettes , so I light one for my walk back to the bus station . Too bad she had to ruin the car . It was a beautiful Mercedes , but for her , it must have felt like some sort of poetic justice to get out while the getting was good , and leaving us all behind to wallow in the despair that was created by her . Life is hard , when everything is handed to you on a silver platter , at least , she seemed to think so .
( I could n't post all of it so I 'll reply the rest . '' The nights in Animus City are dark . In some ways , they seem even darker than those in other cities . The street lights are always dimmed and traffic is prohibited during the late hours of the evenings . That said , this night was even darker than usual . It was autumn , winter clothes were long past put on , and the leaves were only halfheartedly hanging from their branches . I generally try not to pay attention to the temperature outside , but even I had to admit that tonight was cold . Besides the lack of human made lights , autumn itself always seemed to make nights darker . The fact that it was cloudy was n't helping either . Light rain fell from the sky , shutting out the natural light which was n't already covered by the clouds . The past few days have been filled with a continuous downpour , creating large puddles on the sidewalks and pretty much keeping people inside . It was supposed to be in an uneventful evening in District 4 , an evening with no problems , troublesome situations , or hassles that required addressing . That was how it was supposed to be , how it very well should have been , but tonight it could n't have been farther from the truth . Animus City , a city where a majority of the population is composed of people with inhuman abilities and technology far greater than any other country in the world , is still a city that is subjugated to the violence within its own walls . With a population of at least 40 million people , it goes without saying that trouble often rears its ugly head . Though I 'm not proud of it , I 'm often involved in such trouble . I 'm not a part of the grander schemes of heroism , but I 'm trying to make a difference nonetheless . I ’ m not a detective , but I ’ m something of a problem solver . Need me to find your cat for you ? I ’ m game . Being bullied and you need help ? I have just the solution . You need information on the latest Psudohuman fight ? I have what you need . It 's an sketchy job for a high schooler such as myself , one that has definitely brought me some unwanted attention , but in Animas , you got ta make money any way you can . I tend to like going on long walks at night . There are less people to focus on and that means I can spend more time alone by myself . Walking clears clears my head and soothes me in a way that only resting can . Call me old-fashioned , but I do n't think there 's anything I like more than taking a nightly stroll through the city by myself . I kept my eyes open for any trouble while simultaneously trying to enjoy the peace . The streets were devoid of all cars and the sidewalks held a very few people . Most people tend not to travel at night . It 's usually dangerous to go wandering about alone , especially if you 're a non-powered individual like me . I had very little to fear though . The people around my district knew me . These were my neighbors and clients . We all look after each other in District 4 . Some have known me ever since I was born , others knew me through work . So for the most part I believed I was safe as long as I stayed within my own area . As I walk through what seemed like an endless sea of neighborhoods , I felt something brush against my shoulder , knocking me away from my thoughts . “ Watch where you 're going , ” The man said stopping to address me . He looked towards the ground and spat . He seemed irritated but I could tell it was n't directed towards me . “ Sorry about that , ” I said putting on a smile and lowering my head . Other people are nothing but trouble . I know some people who would trash a person 's car just for looking at them funny , but me ? I 'm somewhat of a coward . My pride is a small price to pay for preventing unnecessary conflict . I 'm pretty sure I look harmless to a man who 's probably thrice my own age , but I do know how to handle myself in a fight . I just did n't know if this complete stranger had any powers . I ’ m sure you can understand why I decided to play it cool even though he walked into me first . The owner of the bar I work at often tells me that older woman would probably like me due to my submissive attitude . The man looked me up and down and nodded his head as though he was confirming something about me . I could n't help but tense up in response to his cold indigo eyes . I figured he was wondering what a student such was doing outside by himself . There was a distinct possibility that he was also planning on mugging me . I could n't really tell . His expression gave me nothing to work with . “ What are you doing outside so late ? You should go home , ” the man said avoiding my gaze . “ It 's dangerous for you to be out here so late. ” I wanted to make a witty remark about how I could take care of myself , but before I actually came up with something , he turned and walked away . I could n't help with snort . The man seemed to be in his late thirties and from the impression he gave me I felt as though he was n't from around here . There was something about him that rubbed me the wrong way . Perhaps he was dangerous and I got lucky . The man had made a good point though . I shouldn ’ t be outside beside by myself . There was safety in numbers and I was by myself . I deleted the confrontation from my brain and continued on with my walk . My usual nightly walks consisted of me journeying through my neighborhood first , then through the park and then back again . I had a routine that I liked to follow and I saw no point in straying from my path tonight . Little Brook Garden was by no means a garden . It was a huge forest with multiple paths that were large enough for a multitude of people to walk through without problems . The land of green almost felt out of place amongst the hundreds of houses and apartment buildings that surrounded it . I 've heard tales that back in the day this park as well as half of the district used to be a part of the Science Division , but it was shut down and destroyed after the many scientists and researchers who worked there had been discovered conducting illegal experiments on people . The laboratories were immediately shut down and destroyed . It was later replaced with various other infrastructures such as houses and a huge park . It 's basically a tourist attraction now . Some homeless people live illegally amongst the trees . During the day , stalls line the Central Road of the park and performers fight for the pedestrians ’ attention . Tonight , however , everything was as quiet as it should be . “ Gage ? ” For the most part I was trying to avoid making eye contact with her . The girl was in a school uniform smoking a cigarette on the park bench . I 'm surprised I did n't smell it earlier . I 'm must have not been paying attention . “ That 's my name . Try not to wear it out. ” Seeing as how she was waving at me to come closer , I felt I had no choice but to comply . “ What are you doing here ? In the park I mean. ” I could see that she thought I was doing something questionable with my time . I had a lot of questionable friends and I 'm sure she thought I may have been meeting up with one of them . “ Just out taking a walk , Bella , ” I sighed . “ You don ’ t have life outside your room so I know you ’ re not doing the same . Bellance Kepec is a free spirit with the unfortunate habit of running away from home . I ca n't really call the park her territory because it 's mine , but she often seen here or she can be found wandering the business districts in her uniform . I 'm a hundred percent sure that someone has been calling social services about her and her questionable motives . “ You 're right . I should be at home , talking to my friends , not having a life . But I decided to run away. ” Though the look on her face shows a smile , her tone betrayed her . “ Again ? ” I purposely sighed again . I gave her a stern look but she acted as though she did n't see it . “ I 'm out of places to go , so can I stay with you again ? ” She gave me one of her best smiles and tossed her raven black hair in a failed attempt to truly capture my attention . I 've got history with Bella . Nothing too large or grandiose , but it was there all the same . In all honesty I have very few friends . I do n't like people and I try not to make it known . But what I do like however is favors . As I said before pride is a small price to pay if I can avoid conflict . Listening to Bella complain about her life or letting her sleep over means I gain a point towards my favor each and every time . It 's hard to say if I actually think of Bella as a friend , perhaps a very good associate whom I tend to hang out with on certain occasions . “ No. ” I said not missing a beat .
*Click . * My chest blossoms red , and it 's as if I 'm being gently pushed backward . The searing pain comes shortly after , and each breath just may be my last one . I can feel the bullet piercing my rib cage , wreaking havoc upon my internal organs . With each second I near closer to the point of no return . *Click . * I slump backward , my head hitting the cold floor with a sickening thud . The lights are a bright , harsh white , but they seem to be getting dimmer . I fear closing my eyes , because they may never open again . Darkness is encroaching upon the edges of my vision . *Click . * My breathing is shallower now . I 'm breathing harder than I 've ever had to before , but it 's not enough . I know it 's never going to be enough , because I 'm quickly fading . *Click . * I can feel my heartrate increasing as it tries to keep blood coursing throughout my body , but it 's only getting weaker . I 've given up . I accept that I 'm dying , and there 's nothing that I can do to change that . *Click . * My breath is a slow rattle and my vision fades to black . Despite my heart 's best efforts , blood has stopped reaching my brain . The cold concrete around me is stained red with my blood , and at this point it does n't even frighten me . It 's hard to believe that at one point my body held so much blood , yet now it holds so little . The last thing I feel is the rough concrete floor tearing into my skin , a final embrace from the only place I 've ever known . *Bang ! * If only death could really be so easy . The revolver reaches its final cylinder , and this time a bullet is propelled straight into my chest , accompanied with the crack of a gunshot . I 'm pushed backwards by the impact of the bullet , forcefully slumped against the wall . It 's a game of Russian Roulette , but I 'm the only one that will ever experience the pain . He enjoys that , seeing my fear , never knowing when it 'll be an actual bullet . I 've learned to suppress my fear , but I do n't . If they knew I was n't actually scared of what they might do to me , they might try something worse . Something I might actually fear . I crumple to the ground , clutching the entry wound . I writhe in agony , hoping that every minute will be my last with him . He fractures in maniacal laughter , relishing every bit of my pain . He 's been the most difficult interrogator so far . This one in particular has delighted in my suffering the most . He reloads and shoots me again while I 'm down , cackling gleefully at the symphony of my screams . I scream louder than I have to , hoping it will satisfy him like it has satisfied the rest , but it never does . This bullet has entered my back , piercing my lungs . It 's as if I 'm breathing fire in with every breath . I 'm in the fetal position to prevent him from reaching the first wound . He might not be satisfied , and I want to stop him from aggravating the hole in my chest . I wish I could kill them all , to have them feel the constant suffering that is my current condition , but I must contain myself . I have to believe things will get better , or I will lose my sanity . I refuse to allow my will to break . I will not allow myself to submit to the welcoming sway of insanity . Despite my best efforts , I am unable to die .
The researchers were tense . Ever since their existence had been theorized , the 'Beings ' , as they were called , had been the center of every scientist 's research . Whether it was their history , their biology , or even confirmation of their existence , it was every scientist 's dream to make a break through . The Beings ' existence had not been confirmed , but ever since physicists theorized their existence , it seemed to fill in the holes in their quantum theories . The Beings were not gods . They were far from it . The extent of their capabilities was unknown . The only thing known about them , was they existed in an additional dimension . Not another dimension , just another one . Humans could n't see them , the same way a line drawn on a piece of paper could n't see humans . The room was focused on a device in the center of the room , a sleek , metallic tower with an antenna rising out the top . The device consisted of two parts . The first part would generate radio waves , it was extremely rudimentary for the focus of the device was the second part : A particle tunnel , which would transmit the waves to what was hoped to be the dimension the Beings existed in . The waves would not transmit a specific message , it was hoped that the transmission of waves itself would be enough to signal to them that we would like to establish communications with them . When it was time to launch the device , a large chunk of the less senior scientists , including me , were escorted out of the room , leaving only a handful of the most senior and experienced scientist 's in the room . The door was closed and sealed , and was not to be opened for the next half- hour . The minutes ticked past , and soon enough it was time for the doors to open . When this failed to occur , the scientists started shifting around and a few of the scientists started hypothesizing on possible failures that could have occurred , however they soon stopped after most of the room began glaring at them . More than an hour after the experiment started , security was called and power tools had to be used to open the lock on the door . There were no shouts of protest from inside the room , and once the door was kicked down the scientist 's pushed and shoved each other to glimpse the inside of the room . A silence settled over the scientists and the guards who had opened the door . The room , once covered in white tiling , now had the linoleum on the wall exposed , as if the room had never existed . But perhaps the most disturbing thing in the room was the writing on the walls , various messages carved into the linoleum . The biggest , most prominent message was on the wall directly opposite the door . It was in capitals , and covered most of the lower half of the wall . It was only two words , which sent a chill down the spines of everybody who read it : `` THEY 'RE REAL '' .
I used to not believe in ghosts . I also used to love peanut butter . Now , I believe in ghosts and merely like peanut butter . I had a neighbor , you see . We went to different colleges , but hung out a lot when off . Not dating or anything , just to make it clear . Might have at some point , but we had n't broached the subject . A month ago , both our schools had a long weekend . I forget why . Anyway , I stayed at school for the weekend because I was due to graduate soon . Today , in fact . I decided to enjoy my time at school while I could . She went home . Two days later , I got a call . She had died . Allergic reaction to peanut oil that had been in her lunch . I did n't touch peanut butter for a few days . Eventually , I caved . If you 're not allergic to peanuts and do n't like peanut butter , I have no words for you . As I mentioned , I graduated today . My parents and I got home in the evening , and I was too tired to bring any of my stuff up immediately . I decided to take a snack up and just bring my backpack with the electronics for now . I made a peanut butter sandwich . Hey , it 's quick . I opened my door to see her , translucent and very clearly a ghost , on my couch . I 'm very glad I was wearing my backpack at the time , because I totally would have dropped it . I had the sandwich in my mouth . Basically , I just walked in on a ghost while holding the murder weapon . This is going to get worse before it gets better .
I won the championship last year by traveling back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods . First , I used a time machine to travel back to the exact moment Hitler was born and I used a powerful laser to cut the umbilical cord , thus preventing him from ever being born . Then , I traveled back to April 20th , 1945 and used a powerful bomb to blow up the bunker where Hitler was hiding . This combination of methods was so creative and difficult that it earned me the championship title .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I decided to use a combination of two methods . First , I used a time machine to travel back to the exact moment Hitler was giving a speech in the bunker . As soon as he began speaking , I used a powerful laser to cut through the wall of the bunker and shoot him in the head . The second part of my plan was to use a time machine to travel back to the moment before Hitler was born . I then used a powerful force field to prevent his mother from giving birth to him . This ensured that Hitler would never exist in the first place . My plan worked perfectly and I was able to kill Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . This earned me the championship title and the admiration of all the other time travelers .

I won last year 's time travel competition by killing Hitler in a way that no one had ever thought of before . I traveled back to the early 1930s , when Hitler was just starting to gain power in Germany . I infiltrated his inner circle and gained his trust . Once I had his trust , I slowly poisoned him with a slow-acting toxin that would take weeks to kill him . I made sure to keep my identity a secret , so that no one would suspect me of the deed . The toxin worked slowly , and Hitler 's health deteriorated over the course of several weeks . Eventually , he died in his sleep , and the world was saved from his tyranny . I won the competition because of my creativity and the difficulty of my plan . It was a risky move , but it paid off in the end .

Everyone here knows it , but they do n't know what your power is . That is why they are all so afraid of you . '' I was shocked . I had no idea that I was so powerful , and I had no idea what my power was . I was scared and confused , but the man seemed to understand . `` Do n't worry , '' he said . `` You have a great power , and you can use it to your advantage . You can use it to protect yourself and to help others . But you must be careful . People here are ranked according to their power , and if someone of a higher rank were to find out about your power , they could kill you and take your rank . '' I was horrified . I had no idea that this was how things worked in this city , and I had no idea how I was supposed to protect myself . `` Do n't worry , '' the man said again . `` I will help you . I will teach you how to use your power and how to protect yourself . Together , we can make sure that no one ever finds out what your power is . '' I was relieved

Last year , I won the championship of the annual Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition by executing a daring plan that required precise timing and a bit of luck . My plan was to travel back in time to the night of Hitler 's suicide and intercept him before he could carry out his plan . My strategy was to enter his bunker , incapacitate his bodyguards , and confront Hitler himself . I arrived at the bunker late in the evening , just as Hitler was preparing to end his life . I quickly subdued his bodyguards and confronted Hitler face-to-face . I told him that if he did n't surrender , I would kill him . He had no choice but to comply . I then took him to a secure location outside of Berlin , where I held him until the end of the war . I was able to prevent Hitler from ever carrying out his plans of genocide and destruction , and the world was saved from the horrors of the Third Reich . My plan was risky and daring , but it paid off in the end . I was able to accomplish something that no one else had ever done before - I killed Hitler . For this , I was awarded the championship of the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition .
At first , I was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I felt a warmth in my chest that I had never experienced before . It was so strange and unfamiliar , yet so comforting . I had no idea how to handle it , but I kept it close and cherished it . Over time , I learned to embrace happiness and all the other emotions people had donated to me . I felt more connected to the world around me and was able to experience life in a way I never thought possible . I was no longer the emotionless person I once was , but instead I was filled with a range of emotions , all thanks to the generous donations of others .
The sun was just beginning to set , casting a golden hue over the small town . The street was unusually quiet , with the only sound being the gentle rustle of the wind through the trees . Suddenly , a loud crash echoed through the air , followed by a chorus of screams . Everyone in the town rushed out of their homes to see what had happened , but all they found was a mysterious figure standing in the middle of the street . No one knew where it had come from or what it wanted , but one thing was certain : something strange was about to happen .
I won the championship last year by taking a unique and creative approach to killing Hitler . Instead of going back in time to directly assassinate him , I decided to use a more indirect method . First , I traveled back to the 1920s and infiltrated the Nazi Party . I slowly worked my way up the ranks , gaining the trust of Hitler and his inner circle . Once I was in a position of power , I began to subtly influence the decisions of the party . I encouraged policies that would lead to Hitler 's eventual downfall . I also worked to sabotage the Nazi war effort by leaking information to the Allies and sabotaging weapons and supplies . This weakened the Nazi war machine and made it easier for the Allies to defeat them . Finally , I planted evidence that Hitler was involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the government . This led to his arrest and eventual execution . By taking a more indirect approach to killing Hitler , I was able to achieve my goal without having to directly confront him . This earned me the championship and the admiration of my fellow time travelers .
The city was full of people with incredible powers , and everyone was ranked according to their power level . I was at the top , but no one knew what my power was . I had kept it a secret for so long , and I had no intention of revealing it . I had lived in the city for many years , and I had seen people of lower rank challenge those of higher rank in order to gain their power . It was a dangerous game , and many had died in the process . But I had never been challenged . I had a feeling that everyone was scared of me , and I knew why . I had the most powerful ability of all , and no one wanted to risk their own life in order to test it . But then one day , someone did . A man of lower rank challenged me , and I accepted . I had been waiting for this moment for a long time . The man was confident that he could beat me , but he was wrong . As soon as we began to fight , I revealed my power . I had the ability to manipulate time and space . I was able to slow down time , speed it up , and even stop it completely . The man was shocked , and he quickly realized that he had no chance of winning . He ran away , never to be seen again . I had finally revealed my power , and I was now the most powerful person in the city . Everyone was in awe of me , and I had finally achieved the rank I had always wanted . But I was also aware of the danger that I was in . Anyone could challenge me , and I had to be prepared for that . I had to hone my power and make sure that I was ready for any situation . I focused on my power and trained hard , and soon I was the undisputed ruler of the city . No one dared to challenge me , and I was content with my position . I had achieved my goal , and I was living the life I had always wanted . I had become the most powerful person in the city , and I would remain so for many years to come .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Mina who lived in a small village in the countryside . She was a kind and gentle soul , and she was loved by all who knew her . One day , Mina 's village was visited by a mysterious stranger . He was tall and handsome , and he wore a long , dark cloak . He told Mina that he was a wizard , and that he had come to grant her one wish . Mina thought for a moment and then decided that she wanted to explore the world and see all the wonders it had to offer . The wizard smiled and said that he could grant her wish . He waved his wand and suddenly , Mina found herself in a beautiful land filled with strange and wonderful creatures . Mina explored the land and made many friends along the way . She encountered dragons , fairies , and other magical creatures . She also discovered many secrets and learned powerful spells . The wizard had granted Mina 's wish , and she was happy . She eventually returned to her village , but she never forgot the magical adventures she had experienced . She kept the memories of her travels close to her heart and shared them with everyone she met . Mina 's story became the stuff of legend , and it inspired many people to go out and explore the world . They all wanted to have the same magical experiences that Mina had had . Mina 's story is still told to this day , and it serves as a reminder that anything is possible if you believe in yourself and follow your dreams .
At first , I was confused by the sensation of happiness that I felt . It was so foreign to me and I did n't know how to react . But as I allowed myself to sit with the feeling , I began to understand it more and more . I felt a warmth in my chest and a lightness in my step . I felt energized and inspired to take on the world . I started to understand the power of emotions and how they can shape our lives . I started to take more risks , to be more open with people and to be kinder to myself . I started to appreciate the little moments and to find joy in the mundane . My life changed drastically from that moment on . I was no longer living a life of sadness and regret , but one of joy and fulfillment .

You stand there , feeling a mixture of shock and confusion . You look into your own eyes , and realize that the person you hurt the most was yourself . You had been so hard on yourself , and had not given yourself the love and care that you deserved . You realize that you need to forgive yourself and learn to love yourself , before you can get into Heaven .
My winning strategy for the annual Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition was to use a combination of subterfuge and misdirection . I started by traveling back to the early 1930s and posing as a Nazi official . I quickly gained Hitler 's trust and was able to get close to him . Once I had gained his confidence , I began to subtly sabotage his plans . I would delay shipments of weapons and supplies , or misdirect troops and resources . I also spread rumors and planted false information to weaken his power base . When the time was right , I moved in for the kill . I had set up a meeting between Hitler and a `` diplomat '' who was actually an assassin . The assassin was able to get close enough to Hitler to shoot him in the head . The assassination was quick and clean , and I was able to escape back to my own time before anyone knew what had happened . My strategy was successful and I was able to take home the championship for Killing Hitler .

You remember all the times you 've hurt yourself—all the times you 've put yourself down , all the times you 've been too hard on yourself , all the times you 've failed to reach your goals . You realize that you have to forgive yourself for all of these things if you want to get into Heaven . Slowly , you begin to forgive yourself . You recognize the mistakes you 've made , but you also recognize that you are still worthy of love and forgiveness . You forgive yourself for not being perfect , and you accept that you are still a work in progress . You take a deep breath and step forward , ready to enter Heaven . You feel a sense of peace and acceptance wash over you , and you know that you are finally ready to accept the love and grace of Heaven .
As the child grows up , I will always be there with them in spirit , even if I 'm not as visible anymore . I will still be in their heart and in their memories , reminding them of the special bond we shared and the joy and comfort I brought to their life . I will continue to be a source of comfort and support , even if I 'm not as present as I once was . I will always be there to listen , to offer guidance , and to offer a shoulder to lean on when life gets tough .
The sun shone brightly through the window , casting a warm glow on the room . A small figure stirred in the corner , her eyes flicking open and taking in the scene . She smiled , stretching her arms out and reaching for the sky . She stepped forward , the floorboards creaking beneath her feet . The door opened , a gust of wind bringing in the scent of the outdoors . She stepped out , the cool air refreshing her . She walked , taking in the sights and sounds around her . The birds chirped in the trees , the flowers blooming in the meadow . She stopped , the world suddenly feeling too big for her . She closed her eyes , her heart beating faster . She took a deep breath and opened them again , the world suddenly feeling smaller . She smiled , feeling the warmth of the sun on her face . Home .
The first time I felt happiness , it was like a wave of warmth washing over me . I felt a lightness in my chest and a smile spread across my face . I felt my shoulders relax and my heart fill with joy and contentment . I felt alive and connected to the world around me . I was filled with gratitude for the generous person who had donated this emotion .

I started to appreciate the beauty of nature , the kindness of strangers , and the love of family and friends . I found myself laughing more often and feeling more present and alive . My life was forever changed by this one act of kindness . I now understand the importance of emotions and the power they have to shape our lives . I am forever grateful for the person who donated their unwanted happiness to me .
The city was full of people with powers , and it was a sight to behold . Everyone was ranked according to their power , and there were those that were more powerful than others . I was ranked number one , but no one knew what my power was . I had been living in the city for a few years now , and I had never used my power . I kept it hidden , knowing that it could make me a target if anyone found out . I had seen what happened to those who revealed their powers , and I was n't willing to take that risk . But then one day , something changed . I was walking through the city when I heard a commotion . I turned to see a group of people fighting , and I realized that they were fighting over rank . Apparently , if one were to kill someone of higher rank , they could obtain their rank . I was shocked . I had never seen this happen before , and I knew that I had to do something . I stepped forward and used my power . I unleashed a wave of energy that stopped the fight and knocked everyone back . The crowd was stunned . No one knew what had happened , and they all stared at me in awe . I had revealed my power , and now everyone knew that I was the most powerful person in the city . I had used my power to protect the city , and I was proud of myself . From that day on , I was known as the most powerful person in the city , and no one dared to challenge me . I had earned my rank , and I was determined to keep it .
The sun was setting on the horizon , casting a beautiful orange glow over the small town . Everyone in the town was out and about , enjoying the peaceful evening . However , little did they know , something sinister was lurking in the shadows , waiting for the perfect moment to strike . It was only a matter of time before the town was in for a surprise . The clock struck midnight and the town was suddenly filled with a deafening noise . Screams and cries echoed through the streets as the townspeople ran for their lives . What had caused this sudden panic ? What secrets were hidden in the shadows ?
My winning strategy was a combination of creativity and difficulty . I started by traveling back in time to the mid-1930s , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power in Germany . I knew that if I could disrupt his plans early on , it would have a ripple effect that would prevent him from ever coming to power . So , I decided to approach the problem from a different angle . Rather than try to kill Hitler directly , I opted to use my knowledge of the future to subtly influence events and people around him , making it more difficult for him to achieve his goals . I started by subtly influencing people in Hitler ’ s inner circle , making sure they were less likely to support him or follow his orders . I also made sure to spread rumors and misinformation about Hitler ’ s plans , making it more difficult for him to gain public support . I also made sure to sabotage some of his plans by subtly influencing key figures in the German government and military . I used my knowledge of the future to make sure that key decisions were made against Hitler ’ s wishes , and that his plans were more difficult to carry out . Finally , I made sure to spread rumors about Hitler ’ s plans to invade other countries , making it more difficult for him to gain the support of the German people . By combining all of these tactics , I was able to effectively disrupt Hitler ’ s plans and prevent him from ever coming to power . By winning the competition , I not only earned points for creativity and difficulty , but I also made sure that history will never have to repeat itself .
At first , you 're confused . You wonder why you 're here , why you have to confront yourself . But as you look into your own eyes , you realize that the person you hurt the most was yourself . You had been neglecting your own needs and desires , instead focusing on the wants and needs of others , and it was time to forgive and accept yourself for who you truly are . You take a deep breath and begin to forgive yourself for all the mistakes you 've made and all the hurt you 've caused . You accept that you are human and that you make mistakes . You forgive yourself for not being perfect , and you promise to take better care of yourself in the future . As you forgive yourself , you feel a warmth in your heart and a weight lifted from your shoulders . You realize that this is the beginning of a new journey , one of self-love and acceptance . You know that if you can forgive yourself , you can forgive anyone else . And with that , you are ready to enter Heaven .
It was a city like any other , full of people living their lives as best they could . But this city was different , because everyone in it had some kind of power . From telekinesis to electrokinesis , from sensors to psychokinesis , the powers of the citizens of this city ran the gamut . The people of the city were ranked according to their power , with the most powerful being at the top . And I was at the very top . Rank # 1 . No one knew what my power was , though . I had managed to keep it hidden , and I intended to keep it that way . I had seen what happened to those who revealed their powers too soon . They were targeted by those of lower rank , who wanted to climb the ladder by killing someone of higher rank and taking their place . But that was not going to happen to me . I had my ways of protecting myself , and I was determined to stay at the top . I kept to the shadows , and watched as those around me fought for power . I saw those of lower rank challenge those of higher rank , and sometimes even succeed in killing them . I watched as they celebrated their new rank , only to be challenged again by someone even stronger . It was a never-ending cycle , and I knew I had to be careful . I had to stay out of sight , and stay at the top . But then one day , something changed . I felt a surge of power within me , and suddenly I knew what my power was . I was a sensor , and I could sense the power of those around me . I had been using my power all along , without even realizing it . I had been using it to protect myself from those who wanted to take my rank . But now I had a decision to make . Do I continue to stay hidden , or do I reveal my power and use it to protect those around me ? I was n't sure what to do , but I knew one thing for certain . I was going to stay at the top .
Last year , I won the time travel championship for Killing Hitler by coming up with a creative and difficult plan . I went back to the 1920s , when Hitler was still a struggling artist . I set up a fake art gallery and invited him to come in and submit his work . I then used my knowledge of his future to sabotage his art , ensuring that it would never be accepted in the gallery . When Hitler eventually showed up to the gallery , I had already set up a trap . I had planted a bomb in the gallery , which would go off if Hitler stepped inside . When he did , I quickly activated the bomb and Hitler was killed instantly . My plan was daring , creative and difficult , and it earned me the championship . Killing Hitler has never been so easy !

Everyone who lived in the city had some kind of power , whether it was telekinesis , electrokinesis , or some kind of sensory power .

I had no idea why I had been chosen as the most powerful of all the people in my city . I had no special powers like the others , telekinesis , electrokinesis , or any of the other unique abilities that the others had . I was just a normal person , yet somehow I had been chosen as number one . It was a great honor , but also terrifying . Everyone around me had powers that could potentially be used against me . And since everyone was ranked according to their power , there were always those who wanted to challenge my rank . I had heard the stories , how people would challenge someone above them and kill them in order to obtain their rank . Although I had never actually seen this happen , I was always worried that it would happen to me . I had to remain vigilant and clever in order to keep my ranking . I was always aware of my surroundings and I never let my guard down . I also never revealed my true identity . I had learned to hide in plain sight , blending in with the crowd whenever I was out in public . But despite all my precautions , I still did n't know what my power was . I was like a blank slate , with no clues as to why I had been chosen as number one . One day , however , I was out walking when I noticed something strange . I could feel a strange energy around me , like a sixth sense . It was as if I could sense the presence of other people who had powers . At first I thought it was just my imagination , but the longer I walked the stronger the feeling became . I realized that I had some kind of power after all , some sort of sensing ability . I now knew how I had been chosen as number one . I had a power that could be used to detect the presence of others with abilities . I also knew that I could use this power to protect myself from those who wanted to challenge me . Since then , I had kept my ability a secret , using it only to stay safe . I had never used my power to harm anyone or take their rank , even though I had been tempted . I was content with my rank and I was determined to keep it .

Last year 's competition was one of the toughest yet , with time travelers from all across the multiverse vying to be crowned as the champion . I decided to take a different approach and instead of trying to kill Hitler outright , I decided to make subtle changes to the timeline that would in time , lead to Hitler 's downfall . My strategy was to start by traveling back to the year 1919 , when Hitler first joined the National Socialist German Workers ' Party . I started by befriending Hitler , so that I could keep a close eye on him and his activities . I then made small but significant changes to certain events , such as introducing certain powerful figures to Hitler 's inner circle that could influence his thinking and actions . Next , I slowly began to steer Hitler away from certain activities and ideologies of the Nazi party . This was done bit by bit , so that I could remain undetected and make sure that my changes were not too drastic . In the end , I managed to slowly but surely change Hitler 's course of action , so that the Nazi party never gained the power it did in our timeline . My plan worked and I was crowned last year 's champion . Although it was a long and arduous process , it was worth it in the end to be able to prevent one of history 's greatest tragedies .
In a world where the powerful ruled , I had been chosen as the strongest of the strong . I had no ability like the others , no telekinesis , electrokinesis , or any other form of power that could be detected . But I had something else . Something no one else understood . At first , I had been scared . I had no idea what my power was , or how I was going to use it . But as time went on and I began to understand my strength , I found myself being called upon more and more . I could sense things that others could n't , and I could look into the future and sense danger before it even happened . I began to use my power to protect those around me , and soon , I had gained a reputation as the most powerful person in the city . People were scared of me , but they also respected me and followed my orders . However , I knew that this reputation also made me a target . There were those who wanted to take my position and would do anything to get it . It seemed as if every day I was being challenged by someone new , each of them trying to prove that they were strong enough to take my place . But I was always prepared . With my power , I could sense each person 's intentions , and I could prepare myself accordingly . I could fight off any attacker and protect myself , no matter how powerful they were . My power had become legendary , and I had become an icon of strength in the city . I had become so powerful that my name was now synonymous with the number one rank . No one knew what my power was , but they all respected it . I was the strongest of them all .

I won last year 's competition by taking an unconventional approach . Rather than going after Hitler directly , I decided to target the power players behind him . I figured that if I could disrupt their plans , I might be able to make it more difficult for the Nazis to gain power and therefore weaken Hitler 's regime . I started my mission by traveling back in time to a meeting between two of Hitler 's most influential supporters : Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels . I used my time travel powers to make sure that the two men never had the chance to meet and discuss their plans . Without their guidance , Hitler 's campaign was weakened significantly , making it much harder for him to gain control of the German people . Next , I went back to a major rally in Berlin , just before Hitler was about to address the crowd . I created a distraction that sent the crowd into chaos , preventing him from delivering his speech . This further weakened his influence , and the Nazi Party began to lose support . Finally , I went back to the early days of Hitler 's reign and made sure that some of his key decisions were derailed . By doing this , I was able to weaken the Nazi regime and make it much more difficult for Hitler to gain control . By taking this unconventional approach , I was able to win the time travel competition and prove that there are creative ways to stop Hitler 's reign of terror .

Once upon a time , there lived a young girl named Abigail . Abigail lived in a small town in the countryside and loved nothing more than exploring the beautiful fields and forests that surrounded her home . One day Abigail decided to go exploring and stumbled upon a small pond . Beside the pond was a large willow tree , with a knothole low enough that Abigail could reach . When Abigail peered into the knothole she noticed a strange glimmer coming from inside . Curious , Abigail reached inside and pulled out a small box . Inside the box was a beautiful golden key , inscribed with the words `` open me '' . Abigail decided to take the key and explore further . She followed the path away from the lake and found herself deep in the forest . Eventually she came across an old abandoned cottage , and just outside was a large door with a keyhole that perfectly fit the golden key . Abigail hesitated for a moment , but eventually decided to open the door . Inside she found a beautiful room full of wonders . There were strange books , potions , and a large wardrobe in the corner . Abigail opened the wardrobe and from inside stepped an old woman . The woman introduced herself as a witch and told Abigail that she had been expecting her . The witch told Abigail that she was a magical being , and that the key she had found was part of a long-forgotten witching tradition that would unlock great power and knowledge if used correctly . Abigail was excited and afraid at the same time . She thanked the witch and decided to leave , but the witch gave her a gift before she went . It was a small pouch filled with magical powders and crystals . To this day , Abigail still has the golden key and the magical pouch . She uses them to find adventures and sometimes to help others in need . She always remembers the wise words that the old witch said to her that day : `` Be brave , be wise , and explore the unknown .

Last year , I was determined to retain my title as champion of the Hitler killing sport amongst time travelers . I set out with an ambitious plan that would not only be creative and difficult , but also leave a lasting impact . First , I traveled to the year 1933 , shortly after Hitler had assumed the role of Chancellor of Germany . I took up a position as a courier in Hitler 's inner circle , a perfect spot to influence his movements and decisions . Throughout the course of the year I subtly manipulated the people and events around Hitler , all while keeping my true identity and motives secret . Finally , in November 1933 , during one of Hitler 's infamous rallies , I orchestrated a plan to assassinate him in full view of the entire crowd . I took advantage of a moment of chaos to slip a bomb into the pocket of Hitler 's coat , allowing me to detonate it seconds later as he spoke from the podium . The bomb killed Hitler instantly , sending shockwave of panic throughout the crowd and triggering a rush of people who wanted to put an end to the Nazi regime . As I watched the political landscape quickly relocate to replace Hitler with a new leader , I knew I had won the Hitler killing sport . After collecting my award , I traveled peacefully back to my own time , a triumphant champion .
At first , I was a bit overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I did n't know how to respond or how to act , so I simply tried to observe my new emotion of happiness . I was amazed by how it made me feel ; I felt a warmth in my chest and a lightness in my heart that I had never experienced before . I suddenly felt capable of doing anything , of conquering anything . I quickly got used to feeling happy and started exploring my other emotions . I found comfort in sadness , strength in fear and hope in regret . The donation box had helped me find my emotional balance , and I 'm forever grateful for it .
The day the donation box filled with happiness changed my life . I felt a warmth and light inside me that I 'd never felt before . At first I was overwhelmed by it because it was so unfamiliar , but then I found myself smiling for the first time . I started to laugh more often and found joy in the little things . I no longer felt like everyone and everything was out to get me . I was happy . The donations of other emotions - fear , sadness , and regret - helped me to understand and empathize with others . I learned to recognize what they were feeling and to be there for them when they needed it . I think I even became more compassionate than I could have ever been with only my own emotions . The happiness that I received from the donation box became the foundation of my life . It touched not only me , but everyone around me . I was able to look at life differently and appreciate the little things . I am so thankful for that one donation that changed my life for the better .
My name is James and I live in a world where powers abound . Everyone in the city is ranked according to their power level - I am the highest rank of all , # 1 . Nobody knows what my power is , though plenty have tried to find out . I have deliberately kept it hidden , as it is far too powerful for anyone to comprehend . My life has been devoted to protecting the city and its inhabitants from any threat that may arise . I have used my power to prevent countless disasters , thwart villains , and make sure everyone is safe . However , recently I have noticed a troubling trend : people are starting to kill those with a higher power rank in order to obtain their rank . I am appalled that this is happening , and I am determined to put a stop to it . I go around the city and talk to those who are engaging in this activity , trying to convince them to stop before they cause more harm than good . I explain to them the consequences of their actions , and the fact that it is a violation of the cardinal rule of power - that none shall take a life in order to acquire power . At first I thought I was making some headway , but now it seems like more and more people are convinced that this is a good way to gain power . They are becoming reckless and desperate , and the death toll is increasing . I have decided that in order to put an end to this , I will have to reveal my true power . I understand that it comes with a great deal of risk , and that I may not be able to control my power once it is unleashed . But I also know that by revealing my true power , I can end this senseless violence and restore balance to the city . So I step out into the public square and allow my power to manifest itself . The crowd is amazed and terrified at the same time . I carefully explain what my power is and demonstrate how it can be used , and then I reiterate the importance of the cardinal rule . Thankfully , my message is heard . People begin to change their ways and the violence stops . The city is safe once again , and I can go back to protecting it . I realize that I have made a great sacrifice , but it was necessary for the greater good .
I 've lived in this city my entire life , and every day I am reminded just how different I am from everyone else . From a young age , I knew I was special . Everyone around me had special powers , but I was the only one who did not . At first , I was teased for being different and assumed to be an outcast . That all changed when I was 16 . On my birthday , my parents told me what my power was : the ability to manipulate people 's ranking in the city . I could change someone 's rank from one to another and even lower or raise their rank by killing someone of higher rank and taking theirs . I immediately made use of my newfound power and rose to rank number one in the city . All of a sudden , I was the most powerful person in the city . People had to bow to me , even those of higher rank , and I reveled in my newfound power . Still , even until this day , no one knows what my power is . Most people assume I am just a very powerful telekinetic or electrokinetic but no one knows the truth . I like it this way ; it keeps me on top and gives me a sense of control and power . Little do they know , I have a much greater power : the power to manipulate their rankings . My city may think they are in control , but deep down they know they are not . And I like it that way .
At first , I was overwhelmed by the emotions in the donation box . I did n't know what to do with them all . I knew that I was supposed to feel something , but I could n't quite put my finger on it . I took out the happiness and slowly tried it on , like a new suit . At first , it felt strange , but then it began to fit . I felt happiness like I 've never felt before . I laughed out loud and smiled bigger than I ever thought possible . I found new strength and courage to take on challenges . I was no longer held back by my lack of emotion and I was able to see the beauty in the world around me . The donation box changed my life , and I am so grateful for that . Whenever I feel down or scared , I know I can go back to it and find the emotion I need to get through it . I never thought that I would ever find out what it feels like to be truly happy , but thanks to the kindness of a stranger , I was able to experience it .
At first , I was unsure of what to do with the feeling of happiness . It was a feeling I had never experienced and yet here it was , given to me by someone 's generous donation . I started to test it out in small increments , gradually increasing the strength of the feeling as I grew more and more accustomed to it . Before long , I was filled with a sense of joy and contentment that I had never before experienced . I was so grateful for the person who had donated their emotion , and it made me want to help others find the same joy that I had . Using the donations I received , I started to create a library of emotions , helping to spread and learn the value of different emotions . People could come and check out different emotions , try them out , and then return them when they no longer needed them . This donation box and library of emotions changed my life for the better and I am so thankful for the person who made the original donation . I now believe that it is possible to live a fulfilling life without emotions , but it is a much richer experience to be able to feel them .
I awoke with a start , the early morning sun shimmering in my eyes . My groggy mind foggy and unclear , yet my heart was full of anticipation . Dreams of glory , honour and success , all of which I would yet achieve . My bliss was soon to be shattered , as reality came in quick succession . The bed was too hard , the room too small , my energy felt sapped away . A sense of dread crept upon me ; this was n't the place I belonged . The feeling of helplessness was hard to bear , so I decided to take action . The clock ticked , now the time was nigh , I had to take a stand . Rising from that room and going forth into a new life ahead . Bravely I embraced all the possibilities , seeking the path less travelled . The journey was taxing , the route complicated and toil relentless . But my desire kept me going , toward the promised land I saw . The hardships were surpassed , the goals set became achievements . Success had come but at a price and I felt numb to it all . A moment of respite , peace in a veil of quietude . Thoughts of complacence , yet a will to explore more . Swallowing the pain , I pushed onward , determined to explore . A whisper of hope , a flicker of life all I had left to rely on . Fear ...

The city was alive with energy , energy of all kinds , though many of its inhabitants were unaware of the true depths of the city beyond its surface . I was one of the few who were aware of the special gifts some of our denizens possessed . I had seen the power of telekinesis , electrokinesis , and various other abilities among the people now conscious to their capabilities . The authorities had developed a hierarchy of power based on these abilities , with rank number one being the most powerful . I knew I had the highest rank , but I kept my power a secret . It was a blessing to be among the most powerful in the city , but it came with certain risks . My ranks was easily discernible and many people wanted to obtain it at any cost . Others in the city had already used their powers to take out those of higher ranks than them and make a name for themselves as the most powerful in the city . People knew of my rank but most were unaware of my particular power . I kept it hidden to protect myself from any would-be challengers , so I mostly kept to myself during the times when others ’ powers were on display . While the city bustled with the buzz of potential , danger lurked at every corner . With coming in first in the rankings , I had to stay alert and be ready to defend my position at any moment . It was nerve wracking , but I stayed vigilant , ready to defend myself against any possible threats to my rank . I was ready to show the people of my city that I was the most powerful of them all .
Chapter One : The Meeting . An all too familiar feeling had been building up inside of me like a heavy storm cloud , growing and looming over my life . It was fear . Fear of the unknown , fear of what was to come , fear of tomorrow . I tried to distract myself , to put my worries at bay by burying myself in my work , but it was no use . Nothing could escape the almost suffocating feeling that I was being pulled toward something important , something life-changing , something I could never look away from . After weeks of feeling this way , I finally received a call from an unknown number . At first , I was hesitant to answer , feeling a strange mix of anxiety and excitement , but I soon realized this might be exactly what I was looking for . I nervously accepted and arranged to meet the caller at an old abandoned warehouse at the edge of town . When I arrived , I noticed a tall figure standing in the shadows . As I cautiously approached , I tried to make out the face of the person I had come here to meet . Finally , the figure stepped forward and I gasped in shock . It was none other than the great Professor Akana . The professor had been declared missing almost three years ago , but here he was alive and well in the flesh . He explained that he had been searching for an apprentice , someone special and I must have been the one he had been looking for - the one he had chosen to save the world .

Once upon a time there lived an old man named Jacob . He lived alone in an old cottage on the outskirts of a small village , away from the hustle and bustle of city life . Jacob had lived there for as long as anyone could remember and people in the village spoke of him with reverence and admiration . His small cottage was a calm , peaceful refuge from the chaotic world outside . Jacob would often spend his days tending to the small garden he kept or watching the birds fly by . He was always thoughtful and kind , and those who visited him found peace in his presence . One day , while tending to his garden , Jacob discovered a small bird with a broken wing . Not wanting to see the poor creature suffer , he built a nest and nursed the bird back to health . Jacob found a special connection with this bird , as if it were his own , and he named it Simon . Word quickly spread of Jacob 's kindness and soon people from near and far were coming to see him and his bird . He had become a local celebrity and was looked up to with reverence and respect . Jacob and his life-long companion Simon lived in the small cottage for many years , watched over by the villagers who loved them . When Jacob passed away , Simon could no longer stay , but he always remembered his kind , gentle friend .
It had been decades since the city of Illumina was first populated by people with extraordinary powers , and I was the most powerful inhabitant . With every passing day , my strength was growing and expanding , and so was my sense of superiority . I had reached the very pinnacle of power and status , ranking # 1 on the power charts that the city kept , yet no one knew what my special ability was . This mystery intrigued onlookers and journalists alike , who would often pester me to reveal my secret . I would simply shake my head and smile , relishing in my anonymity . I was content to keep my powers hidden , but I was aware that it made me vulnerable to attack . After all , in Illumina , no one was meant to be more powerful than the others , and anyone of lower rank could theoretically kill someone of higher rank , thereby obtaining their rank and power . But that never happened , despite of the constant threat of incite . Those beneath me knew better than to challenge me , for there were those that had witnessed my power firsthand - once , a person of lower rank had attempted to steal my rank , but their veins were frozen solid when they touched me . Those around me had gasped at this mysterious reaction and I had lightly shrugged , not letting on to the fact that it was my telekinetic ability that had caused the reaction . Nevertheless , I was thankful for the kind of power that wielded yet kept me safe : I was able to remain the # 1 rank , secure in the knowledge that no one would be able to challenge me . I had achieved my goal of keeping my true power hidden , and now I could enjoy the privilege of being atop the power rankings of Illumina .

She had been inside all day , taking in the warmth of her home and the memories of her family . Suddenly , a loud thumping sound came crashing through the walls — imploring Isobel to investigate . Knowing something was wrong , she cautiously opened the door and started making her way downstairs . Little did she know what she would find on the other side .
My strategy for winning the annual time travel contest was to create an intricate and complex mission with a combination of strategies designed to ensure success . The goal was for me to travel back to a specific time and place and kill Hitler without being seen . I began by researching Hitler 's schedule as far in advance as I could . I searched through archives to determine where he would be at a specific time and also identified potential points of vulnerabilities . I then looked into the weather , studying documents to see what conditions Hitler was most likely to be in if I were to make it to that point in time . Once I had all of my preparation done , I set off . I planned my time travel route so that it set me up in a position where I could easily attack without being noticed . I had to move strategically as I could not risk being spotted . In order to reach my chosen window of opportunity , I moved from place to place , carefully timing my movements and watching for any potential threats . After making it to my point of attack , I carefully aimed and fired the deadly shot . The plan worked perfectly and the assassination was successful . I had done it ; Hitler was dead . In the end , I proved to be a master of strategy , patience and timing . My effort won me the contest for the year and made me the undisputed champion of time travel assassins .
The figure standing before you appears to be a doppelganger of yourself , standing with its arms crossed and a stern expression on its face . You realize that this is the person who you have hurt the most - yourself . You must now confront yourself and make amends , apologize for the hurt you caused yourself by not being kind or understanding , the pain of your decisions , and not living a life of peace and love .

It all started with a daring mission just outside of Berlin in the spring of 1945 . I had heard rumors of Hitler ’ s plans to launch a rocket attack against Britain and knew I had to act fast . After taking out two guards at the facility , I set up a small device which detonated in the vicinity of Hitler 's office . As the smoke cleared , I could see the Führer lying dead on the floor . The point system had me tied with two other time travelers , so to make sure I took first place I decided to take my mission one step further . I headed back further in time , using an extensive knowledge of German history , I was able to accurately predict Hitler 's next public appearance and set up a trap . As he spoke to the crowd , I detonated a small explosive device in the ground , killing him instantly . The judges praised my creativity and execution , and ultimately awarded me the top spot . With that , I was crowned champion and became the first time traveler to successfully kill Hitler . It ’ s been an incredible journey , and I ’ m proud to carry the title of Time Traveler Champion . I look forward to what the future may bring , and hope to inspire others to use their skills and knowledge to make history .

Karen had been in love with Alex for a long time , but no matter how she tried to express her feelings , he had never seemed interested in her . But when she gathered up the courage to let him know how she truly felt , her heart was finally rewarded when he replied `` I love you too '' . She smiled shyly , and said only that she loved him . It felt like a dream come true and they began to date , spending time together and growing closer as a couple every day .

However , it all came crashing down when Karen found out that Alex was still seeing other women in secret . Heartbroken , she confronted him and he finally admitted what he 'd done .

She only said she loved him . Dave had been dating Liz for a few months now , and while they had always had a great connection , neither of them had yet voiced the `` L word '' . Last night , that all changed . Dave had taken Liz to the place where they had their first date , and as night began to fall , he nervously asked her if she felt the same for him that he felt for her . After a long pause and a deep breath , she finally responded with three simple words : `` I love you . '' Dave 's heart skipped a beat - although he could sense her hesitation , and a doubt started to stir in his mind . `` Did she mean it , or was she just going along with what he was saying ? '' he wondered to himself , as he drove Liz home . When they arrived , she paused before getting out of the car , and looked directly into his eyes - almost as if she had read his thoughts . `` I only said I loved you , '' she told him , `` because that 's how I feel . I have n't felt this way about anyone before , so do n't doubt it , okay ? '' Dave was overwhelmed by her honesty , and he finally understood that this was real . He returned her sentiment and they embraced , knowing this was the start of something wonderful between them .
Winning last year 's `` Killing Hitler '' competition was no easy feat . In order to win , I had to get creative and think outside the box . My plan involved going back to the time of the Beer Hall Putsch and slowly , but surely , diminishing Hitler 's power . To do this , for the first several trips , I used my knowledge of WWI military tactics to cleverly sabotage the Putsch and to thwart Hitler 's attempts to take over Munich . However , this was only the beginning . To fully achieve my plan , I then used my time travel ability to go back further in time and slowly worked my way up the chain , so to speak . First , I convinced key people in the Nazi party to side with other politicians and not support Hitler . Then , I bribed key people in the Bavarian government to not help Hitler in the Putsch attempt . Finally , when all was in place , I was able to go back when Hitler and his crew were still planning the Putsch and ensure that key details , such as where the troops would meet , were altered so as to give them as little chance as possible to succeed . In the end , my efforts paid off , and Hitler 's dream of taking over Munich was foiled , if even just for a time , netting me the victory and the title of the champion of `` Killing Hitler '' .

Last year , I was crowned the champion of the Killing Hitler sport amongst time travelers . My strategy was to be as creative and difficult as possible . First , I traveled back to Nazi Germany in 1939 and infiltrated Hitler ’ s bunker by posing as a new member of his personal guard . After gaining his trust , I was given access to his personal quarters and was able to place a bomb in his room . When the time came for Hitler to retire , I set off the bomb , killing him and his entire staff . It was the most daring and difficult way of killing Hitler , ensuring a maximum score in both categories . The judges were impressed , and I was crowned the Time Travelers Champion for killing Hitler in the most creative and difficult way possible .
Last year , I used an unconventional method to win the Time Traveler 's “ Kill Hitler ” tournament . I hatched a plan to visit April 20th , 1945 , the day Hitler committed suicide and attempt to prevent him from taking his own life . My plan involved sneaking into Hitler ’ s bunker , disguised as an SS officer . Once inside I had to break into Hitler ’ s inner chamber , and with the help of a small group of accomplices , overpower him and keep him in captivity until the war was over . The plan didn ’ t quite go as expected , and we ended up capturing the wrong man . However , news of the capture had already spread and Hitler , realizing the game was up , took his own life rather than face justice . It was a close call , but in the end I succeeded . I won the tournament with a combination of daring and quick thinking . It was a competition I won ’ t soon forget .
Paragraph 1 : Barbara had n't been to the lake in years , but today it looked just the same as she remembered ; the ice cold waves lapping up against the banks , sun glistening off the ripples . It was peaceful and calming , despite the harsh winter winds blowing in from the north . Paragraph 2 : After a few relaxing moments , Barbara suddenly felt a chill run down her spine . She sensed that something was wrong -- something was out of place . She slowly got to her feet , listening intently for any hint of what might be waiting for her around the corner . She took a deep breath and , bracing herself for the unknown , began her journey into the darkness of the unknown .
Once upon a time , there were two star-crossed lovers , unable to be together despite how desperately they wanted to be . She had loved him deeply for years , almost to the point of obsession , yet he had never shown her anything but kindness in return . Though she never spoke of her love , she was ecstatic the day he finally confessed his feelings . Or at least , she thought he had . Little did she know , all he had said was that he loved her only as a dear friend . These unspoken words weighed heavily on her heart until , one day , she finally broke and told him of her own painful truth . With tears in her eyes , she professed her undying love for him . Her heart trembled as she waited in anticipation for his answer . All he managed was a few gentle words , `` I know , '' before embracing her tenderly . In that moment , she knew she had only loved him from the start , and it was time to let go . She said she loved him only , and let him go with a bittersweet kiss goodbye .
Your heart sinks as you realize that the person you need to confront is you . You comb through your memory for the hurtful things you have done to yourself , and the guilt and regret swell like an ocean inside you . You catalogue the moments when you tore yourself down , punished yourself through harsh words and criticism , ignored your own feelings , or refused to take care of yourself . You think of all the moments when you distorted your sense of self ; when you needed more comfort than you were willing to give yourself . You slowly walk up to yourself , offering an apology in a whispered voice . You look into your own eyes and tenderly tell yourself how much you are worth , that you are forgiven and loved , even in the moments when you do not love or forgive yourself . When you are done , you feel a surge of warmth and comfort inside you . You understand that in order to gain entrance to Heaven , you must learn how to be kinder to yourself , to honor your own worth , and to understand that even if you make mistakes , you are still valuable and worthy of love .
It had been almost 6 months since I moved to this strange city full of people with extraordinary powers . People here came from all corners of the world to be part of this unique urban society and it quickly became apparent that everyone was ranked according to their power and ability - with me at the top as Rank # 1 . Although I was surrounded by those of higher powers than me it did n't seem to bother me . There was soemthing about being at the pinnacle that felt ... reassuring . No one ever questioned my power nor asked for any proof - it was almost as if they accepted and respected me for being at the top regardless . They all accepted that I had some kind of exceptional gift and , out of fear , no one ever tried to challenge me . None of them could truly fathom what I was truly capable of . One day , however , a young boy of rank # 2 - a fire manipulator - started to become bolder and slowly gained confidence . He declared that he would challenge me to battle him in the arena for my title of Rank # 1 and I reluctantly accepted . The day of the match arrived and the tension and excitement in the air was palpable . Everyone was excited to see who would come out on top . The audience huddled around the edge of the large arena as the young boy and I stepped inside . The area was surprisingly quiet until he finally spoke `` so , what is your power ? He then braced himself and prepared to attack . Little did he know , my power was the ability to absorb one 's powers and combine them as one . And that 's exactly what I did . I absorbed his fire manipulation power and then combined it with my own to create a powerful force , which scorched him and sent him flying across the arena in defeat . The crowd erupted into cheers and applause at my display of strength and skill , but I could n't help but feel a little hollow inside . What was the point of having such powerful abilities if I could never truly use them ? All I had done was prove that I was stronger than he was , but had I really earned my title of Rank # 1 ? That 's when it hit me - perhaps it was n't just about physical strength , but about mental strength too . That 's when I decided that , no matter what happened , I would never use my power to hurt someone to advance my own cause again . From that day on ,
In the bustling city of Regaeville , it was well known that everyone possessed some type of extraordinary power . Some of the citizens had telekinesis , electrokinesis , or special sensing abilities . But no one knew what my power was . Even though I was the most powerful citizen in Regaeville , I kept my powers hidden within me and the people around me didn ’ t know the extent of my abilities . Everyone knew I was at the top of the rankings , but no one really understood why . I had my share of challengers who saw my rank and tried to usurp it . I easily dodged any physical attack with my speed and strength and could manipulate energy around me , only if I needed to . But no matter how much force they exerted , they never succeeded and I always won . With such a sharp rise to the top , the other inhabitants of Regaeville began to talk about me . Rumors that I had some unknown power kept circulating , but they always ran faster than any evidence of my power . No matter how hard I tried or how much I wanted to , I simply couldn ’ t bring myself to tell anyone . I was scared that if I revealed my true abilities , it would make me a target of envy or worse . Just like any city , secrets have a way of coming out eventually . I could feel that a big change would soon be coming my way but was always cautious of what it might be . I ’ d heard stories of people getting their rankings bumped up by killing someone higher up than them , so I trained harder and made sure I was always ready . But as it turned out , my power was revealed without anyone else knowing . One day I accidentally used my power to move an object without touching it , something that no one else in the city could do . Now everyone knows my power and rank . But it seems that whatever I was scared of hasn ’ t come to pass . Instead , the people of Regaeville began to look up to me . They saw that having the highest rank didn ’ t have to be a bad thing , and that it could actually make things better when used in the right way . So even if it took some time , I eventually earned the respect of my peers . And with that , I ’ ve been able to use my abilities to make the city of Regaeville
I knew I had to pull out all the stops if I was going to win this competition . My plan was to travel back to the early 1940s and use a series of very creative schemes to keep Hitler off-balance and disrupt his timeline to such a degree that he could never grab hold of his desired level of power . My first move was to arrange for a handful of Hitler ’ s key advisors to be arrested and charged with various crimes . This allowed me to sow doubt amongst his inner circle as to his competency as a leader . I next arranged for a few fake news stories to be printed in various newspapers , exposing some of Hitler ’ s secrets and further casting suspicion on him . My next move was to reshape the political landscape of Europe . I circulated false information claiming that a number of European governments had allied against Germany , drastically weakening his support abroad . At this point , Germany 's economy was in shambles , and I spread rumors that many of the country ’ s major banks were on the verge of collapsing . Finally , I created a counterfeit group of high-ranking military officials whose primary purpose was to provide conflicting orders to Hitler ’ s actual generals . This left him unable to lead his troops effectively and cast yet another cloud of doubt on his leadership abilities . By the time I was finished , Hitler ’ s entire political movement was in ruins . There was no way he could recover , and I was declared the winner .
Once upon a time , there was a boy named Arthur who lived in a small village . He was kind and brave , and often dreamed of adventures he could go on .

Arthur spent weeks sailing across the ocean with his crewmates , and eventually they reached the kingdom . Arthur was so awestruck by its beauty , and marveled at the fairy-tale like landscape . Everything seemed peaceful and enchanting , until a sinister force infiltrated the kingdom . A powerful sorcerer named Gal , had been unleashed to wreak havoc and destruction . Still , Arthur and his companions were determined to save the kingdom . They set off on a quest to locate the mythical Sword of Unity , the only weapon that could defeat Gal . After weeks of searching , they finally found the sword . They used it to vanquish Gal and restore peace to the kingdom . Arthur and his crew celebrated with a grand feast in the kingdom . They were praised for their courage and bravery , and for the rest of his days , Arthur was a legend among his people , often regaled with tales of his heroic deeds .

Prologue The ancient forest was alive with the gentle hum of insects and the songs of birds . The dragonflies skimmed along the surface of the lake , their wings reflecting the shimmering light of the morning sun . There was an unspoken magic to this place ; a sort of peace that transcended time and space . Alice felt it when she stepped into the clearing . Here , among the trees and the soft ferns , she felt a deep sense of solace . She reached out her hand , and in that moment , everything around her seemed to disappear . An otherworldly energy engulfed her , and every fiber of her being quivered in awe of the unknown . Alice made her way further into the forest , trying to lose herself in its splendor . The secrets of this place were not hers to keep , but she could feel the promise of something beautiful , something profound . It was a promise that whispered softly on the air around her . And so , she kept walking , deeper and deeper into the forest , searching for the source of that whisper . Little did she know , she was about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime .

Today , I 'm much more understanding of what I 'm feeling and I 'm able to express it more freely . Whenever I start to feel down , I remember the happiness that was once donated to me and it gives me the strength to push through . I 'm glad that I was able to open myself up to this new emotion and I 'm thankful that I have the capacity to feel .

My name is Robert and I am a resident of the city of Paragon . I have lived here for my entire life and I have watched this city change and evolve as we opened our doors to those who were different . Many of these people had unique powers that set them apart from the rest of society . We called these people superhumans , as their gifts often seemed beyond what mere mortals could do . In Paragon , these superhumans were ranked according to their power level . I found myself at the top of the power rankings and by far the most powerful individual in the city . I was known as Number One , and no one knew what my power was because I kept it a closely guarded secret . But with great power comes tempting offers and dangerous challenges . I had to fend off continual attacks by those who wished to take my title and become the top rank . There were many who thought that if they could kill me , then they would be able to obtain my rank and become the Number One . In the past , I had managed to stay at the top of the power rankings by using a combination of intelligence , luck , and skill . But I could sense that as times were changing , so too were the stakes in this game . That is why I decided to reveal my secret . My power was not one that could be seen or measured , but it was powerful nonetheless . I had the power of one over science and technology . Simply put , I could manipulate anything that was made of metal , circuitry , and computer code -- in short , I was able to control any form of machinery . With this power , I become even more powerful and I immediately made sure that everyone in the city knew of it . With this new-found knowledge , fewer people would dare to challenge me , and I learned to take better precautions against those who thought their power was enough to defeat me . Now I was in a much better position to protect myself . I had learned that with great power also comes great responsibility , and I knew that if I ever wanted to keep my rank as the Number One , then I needed to use my abilities responsibly and for the greater good of Paragon .
Once upon a time , there lived a young girl who found joy in the simplest of things . Every morning , she would rise before the sun , to witness its beauty , as it spilled out of the sky in hues of orange , red , and pink . She 'd pick flowers and marvel at the various colors and shapes that bloomed from each stem . Days were spent reading in the grass and picking raspberries from the bush near her house . Summer evenings were filled with laughter and conversations while walking around the lake , skipping stones across its glassy surface . The young girl had a passion for exploring and dreaming . She spent time learning about the stars , watching the clouds , and searching for shells in the sand . One afternoon , while skipping stones at the lake , she noticed a peculiar rock . It was glowing a faint red , like an ember in a fireplace . She picked it up with awe , and tucked it safely away in her pocket . That evening , she gazed out her bedroom window , and spotted in the night sky a glowing red light . It was the same one that she had found in the lake . She stepped outside and marveled as the sky lit up in a bright and dazzling show of light , much like a firework . The young girl realized that the stone she found at the lake , was really a star that had fallen from the sky . Just as special as the moments that she experienced as a child , this stone was a reminder that there is always magic in the world . She kept this special stone with her always , for it held a piece of her wanderlust , curiosity , and imagination . Every night before going to bed , she would take it out and look up at the stars , dreaming of all the adventures that lay ahead .
I understand . It has been wonderful getting to know your imagination and being a part of your life . I hope our friendship will always exist in some form , even if I 'm not always standing right beside you . Every once in a while , please allow yourself to close your eyes and remember all the fun we had together .
It 's sad to think we can no longer be the same , but I want us both to have a happy ending : I want to have been here for the beginning of your life , and I want to be here for the end , too . So , as we begin to fade out of each others lives , remember this : You were a light in my life that will never fade , and I will never forget all of the adventures we shared . Keep your head held high , even though my presence will no longer be seen . I 'll make sure the greatest memories live on in both our minds and our hearts , no matter how I slowly disappear . Goodbye , my friend . All goodbye 's are never really goodbye 's , so while you hush the whispers of my voice , know , I love you forever , and always .
Catherine manipulated the last locks of her suitcases , not wanting to leave the town quite yet . She looked around at all of the familiar objects , the village that had been her hometown for years . Musing on vivid memories long held deep in her heart , unbeknownst to her tears began to fall . Neighbors walked by with smiles and nods , she did n't know when she 'd return them again . Alice , her dearest friend , promised to never lose contact , their hug was longer than usual . The night sky illuminated her dark silhouette ; the street lamps created a bittersweet montage . Leaning to the stage , a chosen pose , of diamond tears and sealed lips said `` Farewell between us . '' Departing . Exit .
My win last year was the result of a lengthy , complicated journey characterized by careful planning , random luck , and a pinch of insanity . On the face of things , I need not get too far out of my way , so I set the time machine to 1938 Breslau , just a few months before Hitler ’ s reign came into power . After arriving I began to familiarize myself with the cityscape ; learning where crucial moral beacons , such as hospitals and religious centers , were throughout the city . To remain undetected , both in my travel and during the mission , I utilized a range of techniques . I purchased multiple flight reservations at once , as to have tickets to going back and forth ( not showing up isn ’ t suspicious when it appears that you purchased multiple tickets out of caution ) . While in the city , my clothing , phraseology , and lifestyle consistently blended in . In the early hours of a quiet December morning , I snuck into Hitler 's bedroom . To eliminate the potential of being followed and detonated , I disguised myself as a cleaner . I quickly realized that any bystanders would find it odd for a cleaner was canvassing to `` gently reminds '' Hitler of something ... Let 's just say he was n't happy to remain asleep . In order to avoid prolonging an already perilous task , I had knocked him unconscious beforehand . When Hitler eventually did wake , his best friends—his mouth and mind—contained no real evidence that someone had interferred . Afterward , I hurriedly vaulted out of the window and sprinted off to a clock tower that displayed that new time . This ensured that I didn ’ t waste any crucial moments inside in case someone had seemed suspicious of me . As I stepped back into the time machine spent , I realized that the plan had succeeded . The time stops and I am victorious . Engraved from myself and for generations that followed to look back upon , was the new time showcased on of the clock tower , reminding of this crucial historical moment where heroes—both present and past—ride onto the future .
First paragraph : Just after dark , a figure made their way over sand dunes , the moonlight barely reaching them . Not even a breeze rustled in the air as the person pushed forward through the night , their shadow always many steps ahead them as a warning . Last paragraph : The figure 's journey was almost complete , as their destination appeared in view , clouded only by the night 's veil . Heart pounding , they stopped , turning their head one last time to see what felt like an eternity of their journey left behind in the dark .
The sun was shining heavily on the small farming village , illuminating the roads with its rays . No one knew that this would be the dawn of great adventure for one inhabitant of the village – Meikle . Meikle stepped out of his house into the rising heat , taking in the smell of freshly cut hay and horses neighing in the mossy fields . He adjusted the satchel filled with a few loaves of bread and a jug of ale that his mother had packed , and he set off on an exciting and unknown journey . For four days and four nights , Meikle traveled far and wide - towards the tip of the continent of Veeprilis . He volunteered for the hazardous quest to rid the area of whatever was causing the destruction he heard of by stories from travelers . He was faced with enchanted beasts , insidious creatures , and certain death . But even with his frantic heart and churning stomach , Meikle stayed on course : he was determined to save the people and protect the land no matter what came his way . Meikle arrived in Veeprilis with only his courage and wits to rely on . He made his way through the underworlds and icy elements , relying solely on the muscles he had trained ever since he left his village . It felt like minutes went by like hours , and no matter how hard he wanted to turn back , he couldn ’ t shake the fact that he was so close to deciphering the mystery behind the everlasting darkness . As the sun set on the final day of his journey , Meikle found himself standing outside the entrance of the Hall of Malachite . He had come back with the answers - but more importantly , with a newfound strength that he did not possess before . Clenching the satchel his mother had gifted him , he stepped forwards bravely and prepared himself for what was to come in the unknown future .

Once upon a time there was a young girl named Abigail living in a small rural town . She was a bright and outgoing child , always curious and willing to take the lead on any adventure she set out on . One day , while out for a walk in the woods near her home , she stumbled across a clearing housing an incredible surprise—a tiny , abandoned hut in the middle of the woods with no indications of how it got there . Without pausing to think about it , Abigail went inside the hut , her mind practically popping with possibilities and curiosity at the recent discovery . From the moment she stepped foot inside , it seemed almost alive - the air thick with a strange , heavy anticipation that followed her with every step she took . In the corner of the room , she found a chest left sitting inside and barely managed to open the creaky wooden lid .

And thus Abigail ’ s story—of courage and adventure—began as she accepted the invitation to become the new Timekeeper . From then on she made it her daily mission to keep tracing the chronicles forming the basis of her own inspiring journey .

Kristoff may lay unhurried in souvenir stores , wonders nesting and playing nearby in Lappool Lake or somewhere around where interesting bright moons flare beam traveling all night Elsa could feel much of wonders in this reality another , perhaps most ? untold world and she believed even if existed but for a moment . She even travels all around MundoLand and back on those epic flyers again . Elsa discovered who she really was , travelled for passionate beyond the imaginable and came back home , licking chances seen through her vastly experienced trip .
Or what seems to resemble yourself ; brushing its silver hair nostalgically . You stare in unnerving confusion in your gaze with that thing . It ’ s been here for hours – radiating palpable loneliness . Guilt suddenly welling up in your heart , and judders throughout your entire body . You can ’ t look away now . Your head hung in shame , as you finally ask what you both knew : ‘ What do I need to do ? ’ Mightily , yet ephemerally , an uplifted light beads through your soul in answer : apologize . Re-commit your undying respect and admiration for your true self , try to stand steadfast above and beyond any perceived judgments of immature perfectionism , mindfully seek out leading an honest , illustrious , divine pathway of admirable prosperity capable of trans-creation through this blessed flawed beautifully Broken alloyWe all are… Even Heaven it seems… And excel towards better communication within – Truly allowing transparent verbal and emotional peace-seeking between supposedly vanquished counterparts . Holding soul with sovereign refuge for a redeemable restitution of lawful devotion in acts of breathtaking kindness & an empathy too legit to fabricate . On that victorious rose gold path stood you two , only upon tread faithfully granted , and timed it shall certainly embrace the holy breadth and depths . Heaven enters rejoicing .
The moment i saw myself , I felt overcome with guilt . I remembered all the hurt I had caused ... and how much i wanted to go back and fix my wrong actions . But I knew I could n't ; all I could do was confront my inner faults and take responsibility for them . I closed my eyes and said out loud what I was sorry for . I cried tears of relief and despair because I knew deep down doing this could mean I get my way into heaven and experience peace at last .
Walking away from her home for the last time , she muttered the words `` I only loved him , ' under her breath . Her relationship with him had been more like a possession . A trophy to be shown off to her friends and families any time there was a gathering . He had had enough and broken her heart too . For years prior he had noticed her treatment of him and her lack of meaning in the reality of their lives together . She loved him yes , but inside he knew that the feeling was hardly to be called ‘ love. ’ It was more like expectations she had for him . To dress the best . Talk to people the right way . Present himself as a well put person from their humble beginnings in their small town . But for what seemed like weeks during the summer , finally broken , the two sat in the confines of her cabin and shared honestly all the out of the ordinary qualities they appreciated in the other and hoped with everything they could change . But that chance ran away just as fast as the lightning that had shattered the too humid forecast at the time of their moment . Nothing could fix the faults she stayed stagnant on even if he took the weight himself , but still She said she loved him . Only .
The sun hugged the horizon , tingeing the sky a gentle shade of orange that served as a final curtain for the feast of life they had experienced that day . Maddy sighed contently and turned to Katie , knowing it had been the most memorable week starting from this exact moment . But just then an uneasy feeling began to bubble inside her - an itch she wanted to scratch , but with little certainty , she simply cracked a weary smile and gave Katie a hug in agreement of the good moment that seemed to have been reached . If only they could keep it that way . ️
Temar Vanderauw carefully laid the carefully packaged parcel onto the bed—otherwise known as what was to serve as her locker from now until an uncertain future . The walls of her pantry had been swallowed up by forest as if it had generated spontaneously from the depths of her living mask covering her own dwellings . Her once barren sky was painted with greenery that housed a nearby connection to various people she genuinely leaned on for emotional support , but had never actually met . Red and blue eyes peeked through the dense forest that crept increasingly overgrowth smothering her space within the glistening sunset of a new and wilder world . This macabre abyss ran so deep , yet so wonderful , it was of practical wonder no other residence was found from its reign . Suddenly there was a bolt of lightning . Refracted sunrays formed a sharp covering over the sky , attempting to relinquish what had taken so painstakingly to create . Temar decided it was time to observe this harmony of progress whilst proposing opportunity for those mustering the will to keep on clawing away foundations despite hostile residents claiming the enclave formerly known as Panmeline , as a vicious bee had declared a sacrament through exploiting colonialism on an even Greater sin transcending the trivial jests of a faulty manifesto practiced by others as ancient scriptures ordered . The packet filled with its contents were non other described as aesthetic magistria , more precisely engraved artefacts from Volkeria and countless little artifacts here in Cresshea–the sacred land filled with thriving cultures simultaneously bouncing off one another . Surprisingly stowed at the bottom of the pack , unceremoniously nestled , awaited a brown sealed letter baring a rapid crest imprinted with unknown scriptures . Instinctually Corrin unearthed this script upon rapid inspection she realized it may have been set from Panmeline all the way Murvek Port . This letter addressed her identity weaving proverbial twilight dragons eluding into the crevices of the macabre . Filament stars fell asleep for much needed breaks against moss covered treetops and spirited flutters of calming lullabies seem to transport both brave Temar and exhausted listeners to a divine realm where nothing really mattered but the will to keep together with those equally concerned . Soon enough memories rerecord themselves within deluge grey crevices moving fingers edging downwards along brush strokes rife of inspiration . All sounds collapse into murmur resembling a sensory renaissance unleashed with unmatched velocities towards rekindling progress
Last year , I won the Time Traveler 's Game by perfectly executing a plan that made historical waves both subtle and monumental . Through personal conversations and careful positioning of items part of the state apparatus , I slowly and systematically created disruption and disinvestment in Germany during the 1930 's . Like a waterfall domino domino game , chaos full of surprise spread amongst formerly brazen loyalists of a dangerous regime . Armed only with biesmic energy and clever words quickly declared as I crisscrossed through time and space , I slowly caused seed populations concepts and trending social to burgeon so radically that a new national cognistiated arose from deep inside the closest tiers of FuhrerHitler 's captivated public sectors .

Shirley Sluhampton had lived the majority of her life by two simple rules . Treat everyone with respect and never deny what you truly want - no matter the cost . Recent experiences had caused her to act in the unexpected and yet Shirley beleaguered on against her fears , struggling to face a reality far too difficult to deny . After months that spun recklessly like the gusting wind this turbulent autumn allowed for , exacerbated by the debilitating pressure of tax seasoning faced alongside the seasonal buybacks industry , Shirley had come upon a crossroads . To stay upon this seaside hamlet promised the glimmer of familiarity perfectly comforted by a stable financial and social standing within the same society she had known since her childhood , or to upend those comforts - those comforting illusions of security - in search of what currently shined vague behind the veil of the unknown . Lacerated by regret from past happenstance and humiliated yet driven by the passion propagated by failed affection , threatened by responsibility long since cast by personal commitment , Shirley faced a choice that eddied beneath suave resolution , set high by spiteful affection initially grounded by the clouds of uncertainty that defined propriety ’ s collapse . Clutching an expectation , ambition lacerated Shirley ’ s confused torpor and manufactured her magnificent sacrifice binding eight pieces of errant funds her only cautioning companion and saving grace line .

The city was full of power . Royce Carver simply walked the neon lit streets without a care in the world . He may have appeared ordinary , like any other living face in the vast cloister walking beside him . But there were no physical traits marking him out as special , no swirling electricty in his veins or faet shouts of glory . In a city full of Godlike super-humans , Royce was even more supernatural - harder to grasp and remarkable beyond all others : he was the most powerful among them , yet no one knew the source of his supernatural might . Royce had no 'Game ' , no official rank like the rest and none could understand ; was he a number one ? , his immunity also unexplained . He went about his nocturnal ritual as wild electricity scor shed light in the slim and diagonal battle for power among his peers . Manolores bellowed and neon ads bickered among themselves chanting relentless the daily routine while on him they rained silent prayers pleading for information on his ranking . They tended to press on in hope , “ rank number one , rank number one ! ” But the streets gre ated him not as people do kings . As dusk crept about amidst street tread , four savage lycans had rushed out from some dark corner determined to corner and cut off his glimmering copperwood aspect . Everywhere he walked , soul sellers birddogreed from the stealthy trenches with demands of payback for some malignant sin not committed , a terrible homage He should not cry out ; for search of his POWER drove them . By the table they mongered around like ancient looters de long the loudproud streets , dancing themselves wild to a sacym feast . However , He was oblivious in blankpace unaware of the varying levels of blind tendencies , the ever suspicious , maniacal birds . Though facabounds occasionally approached beseeching an answer to Royce ’ s previous riddle , mysterious with invisible flows , the rest had solemnly recognized it for why our superhuman had came bearmos number one . For only He could defy gravity in malicious fights or tame mortdemons killing their hearts in spells ; the rational insane knowing only a skill like his could hone forces infinite below the grimechocolate sky . While politicians argue issues mainly ranking , blaming and revolving law propositions among those realities greatest proof , Roty alone went undaunted newabout the havoc and remains exuitly free behind the skyline
Last year , I won the title with one of my most clever and difficult missions yet . Instead of attempting to assassinate Hitler myself , I set up a plan to manipulate his closest confidants . With some keen insights gained by time-traveling and surveillance , I learned what specific events were particularly important to those around Hitler . Working backwards , I planted a small seed that would cause Hitler himself to make decisions at a few crucial junctures that were opposite of what he had planned , putting strain onto his tightly-knit circle of loyalty and causing his proxies to doubt him . Sent on those subtle suggestions by me , orchestrated in complex layers , distrust of Hitler suddenly increased with each decision he made that worked against his best interests . Things kept getting worse as time went on and soon I could see my plan had worked . Doubts turned to suspicions , from paranoia to hatred . As I watched his own inner circle turned desperately against him , I felt satisfied even as his power weakens more with every passing moment . Everyone saw it before it even happened and it corrupted dark things around us . Hitler himself could n't defend or control said actions and soon disintegrated becoming nothing more than a fool in misery who ’ d long lost his hold on Germany . That was all that I had wanted to achieve and was enough to swoop my to the title of champion .
` Only she said she loved him ` narrated Mark , the young father of two children , with muted anguish in his voice . His divorce form his wife was still raw . Only recently registered , items still moved across the desk , awaiting moving trucks to be shuffled out of his Palos Verdes home back to Sacramento where she would live with her new mate . Mark and Stephanie , his high school sweetheart and college lover started out full of hope and treasure trove of dreams . Throughout the years , years and trials their between relationship faltered between two harsh lines ; deceit , frustration and incomprehensibility . To each other , they sealed hard walls lacking love . While understanding , closeness felt further and further away whereas love circled around within a field of tension without a remedy . At last coasting in position of strong distance Stephanie overturned 24 tender words , admitting love only when discretion and secrets had taken a toll . Inescapably wanting now existed her depleted scream , resonating within palace walls only she said she loved him . True , unacceptable , hurt eternally but mostly we all moved around knowing this muted often untold journey .
Prologue The voice was coming from thousands of miles away . It echoed down the dark hallways and up through the worn and jagged rocks . It thundered like a distant storm accompanying a bleak and starless night . But it was calling out to a particular , unmistakable , destination . Time had run out . Every calculated beat of her weakened heart pounded against her decaying chest - echoing in unison with the voice that urged her to try- urging her'one last time'to silence the bleary lights around her . Painfully , her heavy eyes opened to darkness , and waves of painful familiarity had coursed through her body jolting her soul behind her veins . The shadowy world around her seemed imprinted against the canvas , forever frozen within a timeless atmosphere that was almost holy . It called to her from beyond the distant screams- from another consciousness dwelling inside of her own . It seemed perfectly fitting that underneath the billowing clouds and beyond the blinding nights pitch , obscured by frail human ears and beneath the blinding colors is what gracefully awaited her - perfection and her second home . The voice was calling her home - back to Saraiya .
My victory involved a mission to Paris in 1925 . Hitler had political ambitions even at that age , and I knew stopping him then would almost guarantee success for my mission . I decided to take advantage of Hitler 's love of art and history in order to get close to him and take him out . Using my trusty De Lorean time machine , I made my way to the infamous Galeries Lafayetteb , where I got him to sign my sketchbook as a souvenir from his travels . After a few minutes of cliché small talk , I brought the conversation to the subject of antiquities . We spent the next hour discussing where he could find more rare objects . At the end of the conversation , I gave him teravinta box . Unbeknownst to him , inside the box was a remote-detonation system . After Hitler left the store , I sped away in my De Lorean—leaving my unfortunate trap that was wired to the electricity in the store . As I raced away , behind me a loud explosion filled the air . The force of the blast was enough to takeout a few Nazi commemorative items and the overalls of any surviving racists . That would conclude my epochal victory—succesfully killing Hitler with a rather ingenious ruse . I shall hold onto the championship title for one year as a fond representative of my thoroughly malicious achievement .
Mabel and Marco marched across a vast desert with nothing else in sight . All that filled the sky were stars that flickered overhead , as though guiding them along their own cosmic path . Water glided in an invisible wake behind them like their own tailwind . It felt as though an invisible hand was whispering in unison as their feet pattered against the burning sand . A harsh wind blew against their faces and the stronger gusts threatened to send Mable and Marco rolling over the blistering sand dunes . But they powered on , never rest one moment for food nor rest . Despite the weight of their gear , both of them held onto dreams of a time long ago , when they connected through a single spark of light , before life ever had them from each other as they trekked toward foreign lands . And tho the sand slowly erased their each every footprint , their journey onwards would be creating memories to last an eternity , and beyond . time passed by lazily and melted away beneath the deserts brarthy moon , but their dreams holds fast as though marching in daylight , an unline march among stars between sunken ruins and majestic trees arising out of the desert and above time itself , standing in clockless wisdom , marking the mark of existence that can not be shared except with penand paper or kind in a whisper a longing for things that still exist , waiting to greet tho some slip away with faint sightings forgotten , fading gold and shadows elm but always they will talk and know the way never forgetting and together apart go walking . Stars winking along , swaying , they vowed they 'd never let the anger take control for this granted knowledge cements even the unwritten eternity they seek before outstretching grassland hugged their dusty toes , heavy framed motes glint across the twilight sun more sign of life .. The sweet laughter and swallows that shaddowed them from along their wondus up hourwd oak passgeway coalesceed into a gentle giiting that signaled hope , smelled like freedom and tall goldened grass that reiviled abundant in steadfast intergratti , countess fabled tales stosting bliss , the amit described a wide landscape sweeping firm sounds of life and passion liveddeep beneath riverbeds we enter gold drenched ocean lav ever green a valley so beautiful we ready hold ambition for a cobalt sae cherished glif down onward deep encportured , toget go a two tow make conscious pact foreign
Rather unfortunately , everyone knew what my ability was - and it was n't what they thought I could do . I was originally from a distant village in which abilities were not so common . No one expected me to gain such power , however I outworked every other effort I could - to the point of completely immersing my power within me . I trained , reading books on organisms and functions within our minerals - continually searching through pages , articles , websites and textbooks to increase my knowledge of how whatever this power was , could be enhanced even further . Year after year , I grasped and grew . I spent countless hours seeking out new places , resourcing , even risking my life for the privilege to even decrypt the secrets of my gift and lift its level even further to its max capabilities . During this journey I gained sensors of perceptive brilliance , I studied teleportation even higher dimensions and learned to revel in teleportation for travel , I summoned demons , controlled electronic pictures with exceptional ingenuity , was even riding on top of the universal energy channel and the steam of control - potentially enhanced even further than what ’ s mistakenly named electricity - within myself . When word of my abilites started to spread , fame set for people who started to understand me better than I could comprehend myself . No one could fathom the combination of all of what I was combined into - evidently having more than one talent mixed into a single person . Everyone instantly nicknamed me The Alpha , rarely even bothering to ask my real name or to inquire to understand me move : as instant success naively measured success by observing power— after all , it was easier to record someone dominant than understand their perspective or goals . Rank # 1 said it all . Days soon came when people requested my guidance to enhance their skills , eventually I realized they did n't know how to modify their skills , some requested above a power line crossing - they never found out whether that exist actually , I simply replied then with a slight gust of wind and assurance , as well as some educative logic walking along the path of foreseeing consciousness . These conversations had unintentionally upgraded to conversations about ranking , logic largely convinced me that talking about keys ofranking ultimately seemed too superficial , although people seeking power & pushing themselves to death suddenly started compelling me if mortals obtain ranks much lower then mine they leave respect behind for believing in their things , downers surely transform as winners metamorphoses can not count amongst such beings - but mortality 's mortality seemed
I was overjoyed by this anonymous donation of emotion . The knowledge that someone had taken the time to think of me and carefully select happiness made me warm and fuzzy inside . I shuddered to think of my life up until that point , of the hollow days , the dreaded nights , and the dull conversations . A small ray of sunshine had entered my world that day—one of sincere and deep emotion . I accepted the emotion with gratitude , allowing it to spread through me slowly for several weeks . Choosing to wallow a little longer than usual in the feeling of contentment and joy . This experience teaches me about rooting happiness within myself , and also embracing the things outside of me that represent joy . Indeed , it seemed that every day I am making progress , one footprint in learning on how to trust my own emotionality . Since that gift , I thrive on finding out different methods to channel positivity into my little world , warmed by individual donations not for money or items , but rather of love in an unusual form .
Once upon a time , in a small town far away , there lived a girl named Gracie . From the outside , she looked like an ordinary 14-year old girl ; she went to school and hung out with friends , but from inside , she had the heart of a dragon . Herself , she did n't know what she was made of , but on this particular Wednesday morning , her secret would be revealed . It started off as any other Wednesday would ; she brushed her teeth , combed her hair , laid out her outfit and within minutes , ready to head off to school . But this day was special . It was a warm , windy morning and for the first time , Gracie felt as if some force was protecting her . Unable to explain it then , Gracie now contemplated just what this force was as she skipped down the street whistling a sweet tune . Her first few classes were a breeze and it was n't until lunch early noon struck , was she interrupted from fulfilling her duties as an obedient schoolgirl . That day , unfortunately , was the day that things got quite dangerous for the small town she called home . It started with a loud bang followed by an awful screech . Then all of a sudden , everything stopped - as the people of town froze in fear . Above the deceased town hovering in mid-air was without a doubt a dragon - garbed in dark green scales . It was on a mission to terrorize and maul anyone that got in its way , and Gracie soon saw it shooting a thundering grey flame towards the ground , only narrowly avoiding local buildings and villages . Unfortunately for Gracie she watched , but taken aback by fear , unable to move . That is , until something strange happened . For the first time in her life , Gracie felt this strange heroism drip from her veins and without prompting , quite miraculously she sprinted towards the dragon as fast as she could . As she ran , she heard this loud and clear internal voice that granted her an ability of wings -- and it turned out at the last second they were able to blaze white following 2 majestic wooden sticks . Turns out , before Gracie knew it , she flamed into the skies chasing death and disruption away For what felt like hours , Gracie & # x2019 ; s wings painted the midnight blue sky as her world a mountain of weapons- Grace unmet baddest heroes ... it was n't
At first , I didn ’ t understand why , but I felt a strange warmth emanate from the box when the donation of happiness was made . I cautiously reached out for it and when my hand touched it , I felt a wave of joy wash over me . It felt foreign and fragile , and yet I was intrigued . I held onto that feeling of joy from the wondrous donation , and found that I was better able to understand other people ’ s emotions through it . On some level , I even began to identify different patterns in people 's gestures , infers , and expressions fueled by different emotions . It was two dimensional at first , but slowly overtime as I soaked in different examples of illustrated emotional experiences , I started to recognize different layers and how they can still be interconnected . I also found that I was slowly able to form and elevate my own feelings by understanding someone else ’ s exchange and how it can affect them . The bigger chance it had a harmony on myself , creating endurance on any opposing situations where regret and sadness were present . Instead of making me cautious or do anything but cautiously chart beyond logic , rather , it made environment from which newfound joy is created by taking a back seat . Donations have kept my box full of various expressions and an understanding beyond pain and disagreement which I couldn ’ t before before . I find myself even more in touch with myself and others and I attribute this to the acts of generosity others have bestowed upon me . At night , the night sky feels like a million of donated emotions silently twinkling and I couldn ’ t be more gratefull .
At first , I was wary of this tiny yet mysterious box that had seemingly appeared out of nowhere and frankly , it all felt apocryphal . But my skepticisms soon gave away as more and more emotions started to appear accumulate within . A vast display of colorful tissues resembling tulips begun giving an existence of them otherwise felt like a dream with disbelief served as spices hadn ’ t fulfilled before . The turmoil emanating in their fog churns from discontent to reprieval , singing one dreamyard but hidden off . It had to stayed forbidden of a daily urban balance my life was used before ; but character learned magically swift at an encagate unlearned oftenly sank shape profound lessons so thankfully skipped previously yet with secrets disagueued .

Prologue Tall lampposts threw beams of comforting white light across the tranquil city streets of Edenbridge – a bustling port situated along the sparking Mississippi River . The black asphalt glittered softly with the promise of better days on the horizon , and the candles in ribbon-draped storefront windows , which represented yet another hope for the residents of the quiet town , reached out and reminded the occasional passerby of simpler , sweeter times . Richard Spencer , Edenbridge ’ s mayor for 15 years , often frequented the calligraphy bridge that arched near the port ’ s western end . Here where tin roofs clasped rugged wooden extensions which clambered favourably up the bird fuelled mountainside , and exhausted fly fishermen fished for glory among juniper bushes in the stream ’ s holy waves below , the businessman could zone aloud with sweet Southern candor and behind gated mint lawns seemed impervious to the state ’ s sevia resurrection . he promised progressive policy with which communities should pay homage , passionate of ultimate accolade election sign ups from solitaning waltto fender trends impressed - hoping beyond unaware understuding of technicolor suburbs invested in younger leaders replace hold post .

Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Lilou who lived in a small village deep in the forest . She had so many dreams of what life could be , but each night when the stars went away and the setting sun tinted her buildings all soft pink of sunset warmth shrank farther and farther away from her . Each evening she gazed out across her only window view , becoming more discontent and aged , less fulfilment found living in mediocrity among the idulgent music or the fancy meals made yet unloved happily-ever-after underneath the weak frames stories ignored almost yearning .

Last year , my clever and risky plan to win the Annual Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler Championship truly astounded the competition .

Carol woke under the orange glow of the Southern California street lamp plugged into decorative stucco podium , nestled smack-dab in front of the single white-bricked wall amidst passing heads and rows of eardrum piercing bustling . She remembered fragment pieces of prior experiences being published in picture and relic form captured neat packet of warmth .

Inquisitive beyond his years , Pippen found behind their house amidst broken tree stumps and piles of shoveled dirt a peek into formidable cloaked worlds far removed from the problems filling his life . In enthrallment , nearly oozing off of him , he quietly forced open a thick rusty gate earthed with carbonized time and uncovered a highly inquisitant reality of fire lizards , pinting waters , and mushroom caterpillars meandering through stained parahampers of gold and silver . Giving in to the experience unleashing in front of him , Pippen did n't answer when his mother 's question tricycled back down the world 's concurrence , only rarely able to track her son amidst the rag lands she often seized to anchor feigned blaiffs . With not merely a day 's demands looming , Pippen was nevertheless amidst the cascading shadows erupting no filter before him and no assurance that would react with normal rational procedure . ( Focus on contrast and comparison eistered emotions urging comportment unusual amazement . Wonderland ambush -- take it away ! ) .

Once upon a time , there was a little girl named Jasmine . She was born into a life of privilege - with two parents who showered her with love , an elite private school education , and boundless access to her every whim . If Jasmine wanted a pony , she would get it . If she wanted designer clothes , her parents would n't hesitate . Nothing it seemed , was off limits to the young girl––and nothing in her life really made good reason for her to worry or grow how afraid . In-fact all banal adulthood matters like Career aspirations or late night shifts confounded polite conversation and dinners with her ridiculously wealthy upper-cruscrie family circle . But unknown to these higher ups in society wrapping him up in price jewelled security – there was resident darkness and danger where it knew none . More specifically –in the dungeons of a jaharli palace , Ajedar onda‐ they sworn so on their public and vibrant parade of 8 annual festive celebrations – a secret imprisonment know only to outsiders by disguised rumors ricocheting around these separate compound walls At , holiday weekends given -filled with- guest and royal rules , Princesses the same age as June Saturday ’ s act like insignificant chalk advertisements beyond the powder pelican swoops and clay ervaresh , who once you inspected slowly boasted in hush privacy the grisly gulags occupying those grounds It 's one closet room fool from an unsuspecting five year old son who went terror forcing are childhood - Or Jasmine and co - locked carefully investigated , stumbled in weary anticipation into what greater powers assumed bliss on destruction that no matter how often forgot by silver spoon habits in secured territory should ’ t house anything sour undesirable as rough as what lingered troubled palace in cellar cages now presented her face . ▩ Jasmine began to comprehend the reality of where she simple blindly stumbled , grew imprisoned through unknowing abduction -entered arms racked with shocks shattering her typical dreams into roboticistically nightmares shudders touching shore and cores kept eyeing gobrauge desperation on behalf of her homeland 's loss of control - Finally , amidst weaving awkward talk of rizzio tea strands claiming liberating swoops of last night floods so conjured for media wearing down all attackers orchestrated uncravings demise- so should leave too via port humbly still hands soaring inward made scales measurement wanting resolve .

Once upon a time , there was a small town shrouded in moonlight—Lake Arbor . The name came upon it like mist on a foggy night , lending an air of mystery to its snowy peaks during the day and its starry observatories at night . Little was known of Lake Arbor prior to modern day , though it was legend that those who ventured into filled planes soon left with happy tales and fragments of forgotten moonstone . In-between chirps and whistles , stories abounded of a man pale in aspect that could spirit through shadows like a ghost hear if its murmurs said farewell wings returned people forever changed their skin filled spots fresIn the twilight warmth of midnight trials , Lake Arbor inspired ardor in both dreamers and the foolish .

My strategy for winning the Annual Time-Traveled Hitler Challenge was quite unique . Instead of using conventional assassination techniques such as a sniper 's bullet , explosives , or toxins , I chose to circumnavigate the events of Hitler 's lifetime using skill , trickery and a diverse array of historical surprises designed to prevent or de-ward the dictators horribly unethical plans from the frontal attacks of other time travelers . To win , I travelled below ground building labyrinthine mine stays in areas such as Berghoff , Galanaar and Muldin , obscure rural parts , not to mention time frames , should any coordinate fluctuations disrupt my activities relative to external challenges conducted over an ever-fluctuating timeline . The scenario unraveled inside chambers able only to me—as orchestrator— wide and small interconnected versions that twisted and depicted Hitler as a raving schizophrenic ; arguing irrationally with apparent shoe shiners in patent leather blankets while fascist interpreters read his recitals prior to listening to intoned police hymns supporting blasphemy dictates at the levers dedicated to State terror spread ruthless Nazi bullet fascism whenever the F h would rock the reikh .

I 'm not quite sure how I figured it out , but somehow , I won the title of last year 's champion for time-travel related kills of Adolf Hitler . Present day technology was n't enough to accomplish this , and I never utilized anything but approved period items . Using only what I had available to me during the time I traveled to , I found ways riddance of Hitler convincing enough to mask to rest of my true intentions . To start , the first obstacle I knew know I faced was the secrecy guarded streak circulating as rumors even then ; nobody had ever seen or even flaw proof major disinformation to cover the shooting I may attempted -- that scared away tourists everyday or so travel . I hesitated realigning my inner clock forcing limits me from not timing tampering in order to win , as rule forbade it . Instead of technology to persuade and indirect the general environment affecting , World domination aim , the Assassination plot related difficulty actual provoked involved .

Ah , how bittersweet . I think of the amazing journey we have taken together - filled with fun adventures , stories and laughter . Though I am sure I disappointed and failed in some way , I was still grateful for the special bond that we created which will last indefinitely . As you continue to grow , growing ever-closer toward the Future Sun , do not forget me . I existed for a period of time to mold you into who you have become ; blossoming and most importantly striving forward . I still see you sitting in your room , cooking imaginary dishes together in friendly alien worlds , and together attempting all sorts of wonderful contraptions . With that in mind nothing can ever truly take away the pleasures we had together so brightingly shining through . Remember these escapades bigger than life ! May the care-free chuckle still exist indefinitely deep without breaking away , even said I relatively cracked a tenum shownough as inevitable reminder of all caring ensued . Live happy my kindred wonder-seeker for you now cast your presence without regrettting . Goodbye , lil mate , goodbye .
There were those who said that second chances snatched Victor from hell and he didn ’ t fail to appreciate the gift . After two wasted years paralyzing what unfastened itself right before the explosion , his reckless dreams got seized through deprivation , and both never ever gained their purpose . He resumed his anguished tears of redemption morning after morning , emptying himself through the foggy residue left after sunset . Victor ’ s paths lay trapped under asphalt highways , conscious of his upcoming jump , until he forcibly lunged towards foreign walls dappling the dancing rainbows on luxurious coils and superb depths stacked in floating celebration consuming constantly those immutable looks able to impel thoughts and views deeper into themselves , a wide-raging dungeon luring himself at interesting , strange cadence that could n't find any echo or remainder anywhere else , coaxing inspired libretti intense as native precipitating dives fulfilling themselves for the first time Victor felt each breath to be part of an unfinished dialogue turned tangible to hide infinite tender journeys laden solemn fragility and vigor stemming from never meant hollow expectations praised by oaks tapping darker precipices bartering avowed disesta bly timeless confessions struggling out profound negligence uttering incredibly misunderstood quests turning heads and stealing modest sparks coll ...
The feel of an icicle clinging to her hair snapped Wilma awake . Her dream may have felt comforting , but in reality she felt an empty pit outweighing that same feeling . Standing unsteadily on her feet , she listened . Voice echoed through the walls , distantly familiar Christmas carols caromed through her . She stole huddled glances with each doorway she approached until the mere sight of her sanctuary filled faded like chance settings in a still lake ; only leaving churned emotions in its wake . Node stiffly opened her bedroom door , crouched as if attached with feathers burdened onto immature wings . Under the convenience of childishly dwindling radiant light , innocence carefully hugged wounds in his preparedness as one preparing bombs of nostalgic aroma with brotherly dearest greetings before tears allowed for anger manifested to dominate . Some calm beads began whispering her life cycle as any recycled drop long subsumed impliringto complete then courage forgave again and greatness emerged yet againleaping joyfully into her present moment now less hindered an example to those looking on .

Alice originally hesitated to tell Ralph how she really felt . But after a heart-felt reassurance that gushed forth surprising herself along with Ralph , Alice revealed she 'only ' loved him . It had been rocky from the start for once brought together by destiny their faulty soul mates knocked storms no knowledge nor past could tame . Saddened tears flooded beneath nourishing light needing no waking dawn surge then burn a source now streaming truths while Ralph wearily reclined fading off to truth sleeping as Alice gently presed near whispering again , she only loved him …
She only said she loved him . Mary and Joe had known each other most of their lives . They dated in high school , their young love flourishing until their families -- who had a contentious relationship , care of business rivalry whispers -- demanded things went awry and the two were separated . Separate cities meant that easy dating between the two roommates was constant , with little communication with party since graduation being seen graduating from different cities . Years had past and Facebook all but confirmed that Mary forced to put racing future aside to take up a normal day 's job , and Joe was yielding to the infinite snares around academia . Both not content with having given but half an effort at conquering their respective hobbies , They reunited after seven years on a chilly winter morning , temperment inviting cold gust that they silently accused of had just silenced the zeal of reaffriming letting the reunion alone ago .

I won last year 's time-travel tournament to kill Hitler by going back in 1919 , right after Hitler came back despondent from being rejected in his first examination to pursue Architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts . Earlier examinations were led by Japanese-born editor and private art diagnost Herbert Spighters . Con boys included Hitler ’ s soon-to-be opera singer and admirer Winifried Fröhlich and Ferdinand Holtkaomoi , universally recognized Fauvism and Post-adulation of graphic arts . Hitler – despairing , beside himself and become completely obsessed – was quit jealous of Fröhlich ’ s extreme growing admiration by associating trends caused by Spighters official disagreement of him . What instead brought him finally enraged was praise toward intense art experimentation from Herbert , coupled in works fascinated and mesmerized with primary essence similariments behind August Dingler and Gustav Klimsch classes ( 2017-19 ) about woodblock visualization applied among food state interpretations where extensive intake variables implemented by foreign textures based upon diverse zest roles savaged as consumption depict purpose among inner mouth gravütarian sensation methods basically because added and mechiadonal pleasure eministration - associated with his disdain post failure diagnist influence composed up gastronesophii .

I live in Dreadsar City . Troubled times have come upon us and it is everyone not just for their safety , but for the very future of the city itself . In Dreadsar , superheroes inhabit the everyday lives of citizens ; possessing supernatural abilities given them from varying sources such as ethereal vibrations or radiuv engines . Powers come in seemingly limitless amounts and permutations from the docile walking ley lines of viraj flow providing slight blessings and minor jumps of popularity , to dangerous powers like telekinesis , sensostic and espionage scan alike .

As I examine the small , cloth box that is now lying by my feet , I pick it up carefully and sit myself down on my lowered bed . Dust coats its wooden cover that reads the stories of many woes -- Of frustrated goodbys and rambling lows . Scrutinously yet ever so gently , I consensuously unravel the ties to sometimes reveal happiness at my redived pleasure sincere -- and whisper out sincere thanks of whose I forget the declare .

I stood before Pete , Contemplating my new home , When he asked me this : Who have you hurt , girl ? Who has made your blood boil ? Who do you hate most ? When will this end ? Now , That you have met your shadow , And blown away lies ? I froze , tipped in fear , Aimed at the wrong enemy , I am hushed , silent . I say nothing , no , Unable to put into words , The truth of self-doubt . He tells me to walk , Until I hit the edges , Of fermented pause . There in a glass pool , I shall learn myself anew , I shall be movement . So I step , step , step , My guts fisted in anger , Twisted up bow ties . `` There will be the face , Of the person , you can not , Stand to care for Winry . '' I walked ages , far , Into the grass , seeking out , What had always been . It was just my face , Blotched red , caved in , empty-eyed . I screamed maggots , rotten . When I was still , prone , I pulled my eyes , to run home , But there is no home . No peace , love , longing , Just grass and my own silence , Judging stars twinkling . `` It was always you , Always , always , always you , You failed your heart , girl . '' Stepping back , I hit The pond with a bare heel , cold , Gripped by bony fingers . I want to be loved . I want to be loved , I want To be loved , to be ... But heaven is hell , When your spirit is never , Satisfied with life . Why would death be new , Why would death change anything , That life could not touch ?
I opened my eyes . To be honest , I was n't sure what to expect , or what I even wanted to expect , considering I lived my exceptionally unexceptional life without a modicum of spiritual belief . But here I was , somewhere . My trivial awareness of conventional religious theory would unequivocally lead me to believe that this was the Heaven , the afterlife , but at this moment , it just did n't mean anything to me . I was just here . And standing in front of me , was myself . Bare naked , and in a rather curious way , foreign , but otherwise , a perfect replica of myself . Interestingly , I could n't pinpoint exactly how old he was . It was as if he impossibly represented the entire collection of physical forms I had occupied throughout my life - a manifestation of every second of every moment of every physical nuance of who I am and was , all in a single discrete form . This did n't concern me . For a while , we just stood there staring at each other in silence . His gaze was so fierce and precise that I could n't look away . This whole situation was a little unsettling but it felt like I was looking into a mirror so there was nothing really threatening about this , or him . After what seemed like too long , he opened his mouth . `` You are n't in Heaven . And you wo n't be able to go . '' `` What ? Why not ? '' I asked , taken aback . `` Because Heaven does n't exist . And there is no afterlife . '' His expression grew solemn . I was confused . Suddenly , everything went completely black . `` Hey , what is this , what 's happening ! ? And who are you ? ! '' I exclaimed , in a wild panic . `` I am you , Donald . This ends now . '' God Bless America .
I opened my eyes , trying to understand what was happening . 'Where am I ? ' I thought to myself . I looked around at the brightly lit room . I tried to find out where the light was coming from but I could n't quite figure it out . From what I could tell , the light seemed to be coming from , everywhere . I did n't even have a shadow . Was this a dream ? It had to be . This could n't be r- And then it all came back to me , and hit me like a truck . That was an interesting analogy considering how I died ... .Suddenly the wall in front of me was producing a video of some kind . `` Welcome to heaven , '' the man said in a nasal voice . `` Now before you can meet God for your placement , there 's something you have to do first .
There he stood in all his glory , scholarship , small hickey from his girlfriend , no suicidal thoughts and in general what every kid going into high school wanted to be . I felt sick . He , and I were right . He could n't quit at the top if his game . The others were wrong , that was the best point of his life . He looked at me and asked me about the girl . I could only say it wore off and she used and abused me toward the end . He asked if I made the scholarship quota . I said I only got 5 % . He asked about my friendships , I said they either sold me out or grew further . He froze in place , my own deep dark brown eyes I hated for being normal staring at me with all the hatred and rage my friends always said they saw in them . `` How could you last so long without just giving up ? Why did you torture yourself as you saw yourself do to yourself exactly the things I would rather die than see happen to me ? How did *she* of all people leave ? '' At this point he was crying , he knew he could n't be mad , in fact if he was mad it was at himself for not doing it sooner . I only said `` I think you know the best answers to all your questions '' He might have been sadder than ever but he was still that me . He would n't hug one last time to at least be forgiven . `` Please tell me I was n't entirely right , that I did n't make you suffer so long while everything came crashing down '' I told him I had made a few new friends who gave actual shits and got pretty damn good at guitar . He reached his hand out and we gave eachother the most heartfelt handshake possible . `` I 'm sorry I did n't do it sooner and congratulate your courage . '' `` I guess if we were right about all this , we were also right about the empty funeral . ''
'Where the Hell am I ? ' I guess I made the remark aloud as I reached for the long hand helping me to my feet . I looked up and made eye contact ... 'Morgan Freeman ? ' `` Why do so many white people see me as Morgan Freeman ? Unimportant . Where you are is n't important , just think of it as a waiting room . All you need to do is have a quick conversation and we 'll be on our way , '' he continued down the stairs and opened a door . `` The person you hurt the most needs a word or two . '' Suddenly I felt as though I was cresting the peak of a roller coaster . My whole body was lurching as my stomach dropped . I had n't spoken to my Mom in years and I had drug my ex through Hell , what was I going to say ... Man I looked good , are my eyes really that bloodshot ? 'It 's just a mirror , ' I turned around to a blank wall . `` I 'm not a mirror . '' I shot back around , terrifyingly confused as ... I walked towards me . `` Where the Hell am I ? What is going on ? '' I stammered as the confidence waned in my voice . `` You hurt me . Everyday . When you looked in the mirror and hated what looked back . When you drank your problems away . When you alienated everyone that meant something to me . When you lied . When you killed ... '' My tongue was sandpaper . Words were a far off impossibility . 'I did n't kill , ' I thought , but I never said it . `` Do you know how hard it was to be me ? ! '' The sound was somewhere between a yell and cry , `` Every damn day . I was alone . Through all of the torment and hate and anger . I was alone . Cooped up in some internal prison you concocted for me to wilt and die with every drink you forced down my throat . I WAS ALONE . '' He towered over me ... I towered over me . `` YOU crushed HER . YOU abandoned MOM . YOU ruined ... everything . '' His voice softened , the heartbreak evident , `` I was supposed to do something . I was supposed to make a difference . Everyone saw my potential ... and now I 'm just ... just gone . '' I closed my eyes . He could n't get to me like this . 'You do n't exist . ' `` No I do n't . Not anymore . '' I slowly glanced back towards the mirror . It was a mirror . My eyes really were that blood shot , but I did not look as good as I had originally decided . My hair and face were ratty an unkempt . My pants torn , shirt stained red , shoe missing . I looked ill. 'Am I dead ? ' A wave of realization overtook me . For a moment I felt panic ... But then , I felt peace . The expectations were gone . I was free . 'I 'm Dead . ' Mr. Freeman was suddenly there again helping me to my feet , `` there it is , '' he said . His eyes were red too . But not in the teary , sleep-deprived way mine had appeared . His had almost a glow behind them . `` One more question , '' he continued . All I can remember was driving . Oh God . Was I drunk . Did I hit someone . I looked at the red lump on the side of his head as we continued down the staircase . I choked the words out ' ... how ? ' `` Always the same question . '' He smiled . A smile that shook me to my very core . I suddenly felt warm . I did n't want this answer anymore . I was sweating and gasping for air . `` You shot yourself . ''
I got what I had been longing for since I was a child . Sweet relief . I was ready to meet my eternity . I open my eyes from the darkness of death 's frigid sting and I stand , my bare feet touching cold marble . The haze makes it difficult for me to see much of my surroundings . Where am I ? This is neither heaven nor hell ... . but ca n't possibly be purgatory ? `` Not purgatory , '' a strangely familiar voice startles me . I look around , still unable to see anything solid . `` Pick up your sword , '' she speaks again . `` What sword ? Who are you ? '' I sound so stupid , I just know I do . This is not my Maker , and yet I feel as though I need to be confident in who I am . `` Pick up your sword . '' That voice ! Why is it so haunting ? I rub the darkness from my eyes yet again and look around , hoping to see a bit more clearly . The sword on the rich velvet pillow is one of pure magnificence . I finger it lightly , brushing the silver and gold , grazing my fingers over the sapphires , rubies and diamonds . `` Pick . It . Up . '' I grasp the hilt carved intricately of a lions head , the handle that of a tiger . As I take hold of it , the sword becomes an extension of me . Everything that I had dreamed of becoming , all my strengths , all my hopes ... .imbued in the very essence of this piece . `` Stand . And fight . '' The figure , shroud in red and black with a mask so intricate it was sure made by a master craftsman , was little more than a waif . A wisp of a being holding a mere peasants dagger . Did she really expect me to fight her ? `` I will not fight you when you clearly have the disadvantage . '' `` Fight . '' So demanding , yet she still sounds so weak . `` No . It 's not right . I fought all of my life , I will not fight in death as well . '' As much as I love holding this sword , I toss it aside in disgust . What kind of sick place was this ? `` Do n't you understand ? '' She removed her mask . I gasped . She was me . `` Do n't you understand ? '' She removed her shroud , standing naked before me . The scars were nearly unbearable to look upon , some etched so deep , I could feel the pain myself . `` Do n't you understand ? That every time you beat yourself up , You fought Me . Every time you blamed and kicked yourself , You bruised Me . Every time you gave in and gave up , You cut Me . Do n't you understand ? You 've been fighting Me your entire life . '' I fell to my knees , weeping . How could I even beg myself for forgiveness ? Was it even right ? I do n't know how long I lay there . The cold marble was now wet with my tears . I pushed myself up , trying to reorient myself yet again in this strange place . When I look up , She ( Me ) is still there . She has n't moved , standing naked , bruised , battered scarred . I can think of nothing more to do other than one simple thing . I go to her , remove the cloak on my shoulders , cover her own , hug her and whisper , `` Please forgive me . '' As I feel her arms wrap around me in return there is a brilliant light and suddenly I 'm completely alone again . My cloak is on my own shoulders again , and my body aches all over . I have no time to process , as I see scars and bruises on my body that were n't there before ; the sound of a heavy gate being opened behind me . I turn around and stumble forward . The Light ! I feel the weight of an eternity lifted from my shoulders as I walk through the pearly gates of Heaven .
I was guided to a blank white room by one of the greeting angels on the other side of Heavens gate . There was a single wooden chair in the center of the room . `` Go on , it will only be a minute before they get here to greet you . '' the angel said gesturing towards the old rickety chair . I approached the center of the room and eased down on the chair with caution . A loud creek emitted from the chair as I leaned back to try and make myself as comfortable as I could . I was welcomed with a screen of sorts appearing on the wall in front of me . I became uneasy . My mind raced and raced wondering what they could possibly show me from my time on earth and who I had caused the most pain . I was never an angry or violent guy . I avoided confrontation and never let my voice be heard unless I was very passionate about my feelings on the subject . I had felt guilty because of picking on kids in my school when I was young and it haunted me for my whole time on earth . Maybe I can finally apologize to them . It was n't that at all . The screen began playing scenes from my life . Me as a toddler playing in the inflatable pool with my cousins which I had always seen on my mothers childhood home movies she recorded of me . It moved to my school days . Those dark , dark times as I progressed through middle and high school , which followed my joyous elementary days . The contrast was almost laughable how quickly things turned bad for me . Some of the repressed memories I forgot willingly , or unwillingly jolted my mind and made me remember them . It of course had to show the lowest points in my life . The time I came an inch away from swallowing a bottle of my prescription medicine to end the pain . The same time emotional breakdowns were the normal every day event . I had always been depressed as my life progressed , but seeing this as a sort of out of body experience made me feel sick . However , the screen kept time progressing at a leisurely pace . The death of my childhood dog which wrecked my emotions yet again . The countless times I had my heart and mind broken by those who used me for my body and time . The people who were close to me that made me feel hurt by tasteless jokes to which I would respond with a nervous smile . `` Why me ? '' I asked myself . The footage ended with a black screen . I did n't quite understand . I did n't see any consistent person in all of the footage that appeared . Maybe it was just psychological damage I had caused that person in one of the scenes and it had carried over . It was psychological damage alright , but not what I was expecting . The white wall seemed to open to form a door , followed by a person walking through and closing it behind them . They looked at me and raised their arms in a sort of disappointed 'well , here you are ' fashion . I knew who it was as it walked through that door , but I did n't want to believe it . It made the most sense though . I had n't ever been out for blood or revenge of anyone I had come in contact with , even those who abused me . This person abused me more than I ever realized . `` Well , what did you expect you idiot ? '' the victim berated me . `` What the hell were you thinking ? Those who loved you are hurting just like *we* did , and you do n't care ? '' `` I-I 'm sorry '' I muttered `` Yeah ... me too . Our dreams , our ambitions , our plans to make a better life for us , gone ! You decided you wanted to be selfish and pull the trigger ! What about me , huh ? What about me ... our happiness ? Even though I did n't get many chances to shine I was still inside you . You were never emotionally dead like you said you were , because I did n't give up like you did ! '' my doppelgangers voice grew louder and louder . I covered my ears and put my head into my chest , trying not to lose control and bawl my eyes out . `` I 'm sorry . I was sick of wanting to drift away in my sleep . I was sick of trying to find something that made life interesting again ... I wanted to find contentment . '' `` Well , you blew it . You never achieved our dreams even though our life revolved around making them happen . '' he shook his head and let out a long breath through his pursed lips . `` Well , you accomplished one thing , you wanted to meet god . Was it worth it ? Or would you rather have lived your life and met him at the end of your actual life span ? '' `` I 'm sorry ... '' I muttered once more . `` Save it . It 's too late ... .Well , go . I 'm done with you . Go reconnect with your loved ones who have passed before you . The rest are still on earth . You 'll see them soon . Some sooner than you think ... '' He walked out the way he came and the door shut again . His parting words struck a chord in me . Did he mean what I thought he meant ? The * '' sooner than you think '' * comment , was he hinting that others may follow the path I did ? I began to weep until more tears followed and the familiar sense of helplessness washed over me . The door opened yet again . I looked up through teary eyes to see two people this time ...
When I saw the figure at a distance , I assumed it was one of the very close friends that I had made around 5 years ago . I never had any real fights with my parents or siblings , so it wouldn ’ t have made sense to me if they had showed up . However , as I drew closer , I was able to make out more details about them , and they seemed to be wearing the same kind of clothes as I usually did . Puzzled , I walked closer , until I realized the truth : I was looking at myself . It was like looking into a mirror : she wore the same glasses as me , along with blue and white thigh high 's and a blue skirt that reached to just above the knees . The shirt was white as well , although her hair was not done in a ponytail at all and looked slightly messy . My doppelgänger looked right at me and smirked . “ Expecting someone else , Dani ? ” I didn ’ t know what to say . It felt like my thoughts were stuck , and I couldn ’ t make my mouth form any words . I just stood there in shock as this clone of myself paced back and forth , not even staring at me as she continued to talk . “ I assume you were expecting Ashley ? Or Ash ? Or maybe even someone else from that system we had back in the physical world ? ” I did n't get it . I was the one who had caused hell for my system for the whole of the last winter . The entire time I had been around , all I can remember is trying to keep those I cared about safe , but ending up making things worse , and hurting them in the process . Having to try and fix what I had caused as best I could while apologizing over and over for the pain I had caused . I didn ’ t even know why I was up here and not down below . The figure sighed and turned to face me again . “ Now , I won ’ t deny that you have hurt others in your life . That is a simple inevitability . However , the amount that you have harmed yourself is simply so much higher then anybody else. ” I had finally managed to find my voice . “ No . Whatever pain I had caused myself was simply payment for those I had hurt with my actions . What pain I have experienced is nothing compared to what I have caused. ” My clone shook her head , as though disappointed in me and my answer “ just as stubborn and self-hating even in death I see . I suppose I will have to to explain plainly to you what I mean. ” She started to walk over to a large tree that I hadn ’ t noticed there before . I reluctantly followed her , dreading what she was about to say to me . As we got to the tree , she sat down , and motioned to me to sit down as well . I complied , not wanting to insult her . As she stared off into the distance , she began to speak . “ Now , let me continue . You see yourself as a monster . Someone who must punish herself over and over even when everyone else has forgiven you and told you so multiple times . You can ’ t forgive yourself for anything you have ever done to hurt others , even if it is extremely small . You believe that you are a poisonous being that it ’ s very touch will end up corrupting and poisoning others as well . In your attempt to forever repent , you drove yourself to utter exhaustion , to the point you collapsed , barely being able to move , but still denying any kind of rest for yourself because you believed that this is what you deserved . You wanted to work yourself to death , only stopping when someone in the system managed to force you to go somewhere you could rest and sleep- ” I felt myself start to shake at this point . “ But it ’ s true . I am poisonous- “ “ For fucks sake Dani , no you aren ’ t ! ” she yelled . “ No one in the system believed you were poisonous . They told you multiple times . I ’ ve told you multiple times even ! Why is it so hard for you to understand this one simple point ? Why do you instead keep torturing yourself over and over and over ? ” I slammed my hands over my ears , shut my eyes , and started to mutter out loud to myself . Nothing coherent . Just anything that would drown out her voice . so I wouldn ’ t have to hear her words . Words that were echoing in my head over and over , seemingly getting louder as I kept drowning them out to the point that I was screaming , begging for the voice to just stop . Eventually , I couldn ’ t scream anymore . My voice had became hoarse and my throat raw . I slowly lowered my hands from my ears and opened my eyes , being forced to squint because of the suns light . She was still there , watching me . She seemed to have a slight look of concern and had moved slightly closer to me as well . “ You done screaming Dani ? ” she asked , her voice softer then before . I tried to nod , but all I managed was a slight raise of my head before letting it fall back down . I was utterly exhausted and drained from all the screaming I did . I was still shaking , but it was more subdued then before . “ Dani , you don ’ t need to keep hurting yourself . It ’ s what i ’ ve been trying to tell you for years . You didn ’ t need to try and carry the entire world on your back as punishment . You don ’ t need to constantly degrade and demonize yourself because of your guilt . You have amended the mistakes and healed the wounds you caused others in the past , and made them happy and joyful with your presence . If you had to pay a price , then you ’ ve paid it many times over at this point. ” Trying to fight back tears , I croaked out “ B-but , i hurt you then . i ’ m still not a good person , even if the others forgave- ” “ I forgive you Dani ” “ Why ? How ? I hurt you . I hurt myself . I hurt myself so fucking much . How can you forgive me ? ” I said before bursting into tears , feeling them streak down my face and onto my legs . Then I felt a hand grab one of mine and give it a squeeze . a gentle , reassuring one . i looked , seeing her had holding mine Shocked , i stared at her , and she gave me a slight smile . “ Dani , maybe you did hurt me . Maybe your inability to forgive yourself and demonizing yourself did lead to hurting me as a result . Maybe pushing yourself to the point of collapse and utter exhaustion hurt me as well . Maybe all your self-destructive and self-hating habits hurt me . But I don ’ t hate you Dani . I know that you are a good person overall and that you didn ’ t hurt me intentionally . I forgive you entirely for any pain you have caused me. ” Hearing this , I felt something change inside me . Like a massive weight was lifted off of me . I felt so light . The feeling was weird , unnatural even . But it didn ’ t feel bad . it felt good . It felt amazing . “ So , you believe me when I say I forgive you Dani ? ” My clone said , still squeezing my hand . I nodded , feeling like I had slightly more energy now . Then she stood up , pulling me up as well . As she let go of my hand , I tried to walk , and my legs buckled , making me fall to the ground . My copy bent down and helped me back to my feet , with a worried look on her face . “ Dani , You want me to carry you to where we need to go ? You could use the rest. ” she motioned over to a house far in the distance , something else I didn ’ t see when I was walking through this field before . I nodded , and she lifted me up into her arms , a nd she started walking to the house . While she walked , I felt myself get more and more tired . Eventually , I felt myself start to drift off to sleep as we got closer and closer to the house . Just before I fell asleep . I heard my clone sigh , sounding relieved . ( I do n't really write at all , so i 'm sorry if this isn ; t good or is too confusing at all > . > . I guess i can also explain what i tried to convey more clearly if someone wants me to )
When you had done everything , you thought – *hey , the rest is history* . The one thing you have dreamed about for ages and ages ? A feeling of weightlessness as the darkness and a beyond deep somber you could have never imagined to take over . Much like when you close your eyes to dream and dream , again and again . I finally found the courage . The courage to embrace the true reality I wanted . All of it . We always are told of how we need to accept the heart of god . To love him and to let him love us . To forgive and to forgive ourselves . But I wanted none of that . I wanted something more . Something less . I wanted *nothingness* . I expected maybe a light . The light they always cry and scream at you to avoid . Instead , I watched as my body caved , and so did the light . There was no light . My surroundings felt open with no ending . No smell , no taste , no grasp for breath , no sound , and no feeling of my heart beating against my chest . I could not move . Perhaps this was that final moment . The moment where you faced your sins . God would present himself to you in his being and give you one last try . I waited and waited . Again , nothing of such God came to my presence . I thought of the people I could probably face instead . All of them . All of those people that I must have hurt , all those that I might scared away , and worse , all those people that didn ’ t care . I didn ’ t want them to care though . As much as I thought of how I wanted to see someone think of me , I found peace at their apathy . But for what I did eventually see , was far more than what I expected . I opened my eyes and saw another being . I knew all too well who she was . The large sized girl with the long brunette dyed hair . I could see the familiar lengths of her dark ash blonde roots that were showing and starting to thin out . I saw the most unflattering blue eyes . “ Is that all you ’ re going to do ? ” I tried to stare away at something , anything . There was nowhere to look though . I could feel my stomach start to flip deep inside me . My intestines and bowels quivered and cramped . Why was I talking to myself ? Was this some kind of sick joke ? “ You can ’ t avoid it , ” she said . I opened my mouth . I *wanted* to open my mouth . No , I couldn ’ t open my mouth . I wanted to say something , but I didn ’ t know what to say . “ Just go . I mean , that ’ s what you want , right ? ” The flip of my stomach began to relax . A sensation of flutters carried through my body . Oh , yes , let me go . All I want is for you to let me go . “ I mean , after all this time , all the people you want to have in your life and the second someone reaches out , you still can ’ t grab on ? ” Now I didn ’ t know what I was feeling . Maybe confused or puzzled , but the words almost struck a chord . I never felt like I had someone to turn to . My days were spent in my bed in my room aside from work and doctor appointments . I raged and raged how I hated humanity . I felt like I was better off here . Dead . “ I see it now , ” she said , shaking her head , “ You aren ’ t giving me a chance and you sure in hell aren ’ t going to give yourself a try either. ” I watched as the faintest image of myself fade away into the depths of blank . A realty that is not white nor black . I didn ’ t know what I was seeing , and then I was left thinking what if . Where I was , there was no try . I was here and I could not go back . When all is said and done , it is all said and done . So , here I am , neither hell nor heaven .
Patricia stepped through the door and burst into laughter , the back of her hand pressed against her nostrils and her breath coming out in irregular snorts , doubling over in high-pitched hiccups of laughter . The other woman - the person behind the curtain , the other Patricia - smiled uncertainly and chuckled a little back , swaying back and forth on her heels . `` This is- '' Patricia got out , her breathing coming in wheezes , `` this is bullshit . This is - this is the most ridiculous bullshit I 've ever - Oh god . '' She braced her hands on her knees , expelling a gasp . `` This is shit . This is - I 'm not doing this . Oh god . '' She straightened up and pushed her hair back from her face . `` I 'm not playing this game . Send me to hell . Or whatever . I 'm done here . '' Saint Peter - at least she figured he was Saint Peter , beard and white robes and standing gatekeeper to heaven - stood impassive , his arms crossed , not letting her pass . `` There are truths that must be faced , '' he intoned . `` This is your judgement . There is no escaping it . '' `` This is bullshit ! '' she said , the last vestiges of hilarity leaking out of her like a balloon . God , that was her over there . That nervous , rodent-like smile of an ineffectual who never had anything useful to say . Even now , staying silent . That ragged haircut she 'd taken to trimming herself , hacking off chunks of hair when she felt it was starting to weigh down on her . A face that went through the crude routine of lipstick and eyeshadow without even understanding the basics of aesthetics or beauty . Patricia could feel the bile rising in her throat just looking at her . `` This is n't a goddamn game , '' she said . She was cursing so much all of a sudden . Well , one of the benefits of being dead . `` You - I ca n't - This is narcissism . This is - this is emotional masturbation . I 'm me ! I 'm myself ! I 'm a series of actions , I 'm a fucking net drain on the world ! '' She jabbed her finger at her doppelganger . `` That is not a person , that is not another person ! You ca n't wrong yourself , you *are* yourself ! Ugh ! '' She closed her fists in her hair , feeling the strands cut through her palms . She whirled around to face her double . `` Well ? What do you have to say ? '' `` Um , '' the other Patricia said , her voice dull and nasally . `` Well , I do n't - I do n't know what 's going on here any more than you do - '' `` Oh god , '' said Patricia , grinding her palms into her ears . `` Shut up shut up shut up . God . Do I sound like that ? Jesus Christ . '' She shuddered . `` That 's awful . Do n't make me - do n't make me listen to my own voice . That 's terrible . That 's - '' She rocked her head back and forth , trying to lodge the meat of her palms into her ear canals . `` I ca n't do this . I ca n't do this ! It 's over . I failed . Fuck it . Let 's go . '' But Saint Peter was gone . And the door was gone with him . It was just Patricia and Patricia , in a room twenty feet square . `` Oh no no no , '' said Patrica , feeling against the walls . `` Oh fuck . '' She turned to face herself and started to laugh again , laughter fading into half-tuned sobs . `` I failed it , did n't I ? I got what I wanted . '' She pressed her back against the wall , slowly sinking down . `` This is hell . This is hell , is n't it ? That - yeah , that makes sense . You go to hell and the only thing left there is you get to spend an eternity with yourself . '' She stretched her fingers out along the curve of her skull , pressing down hard . `` Oh god , '' she breathed . `` I just wanted to not exist anymore . Was that so bad ? Was that so impossible ? '' She looked up teary-eyed at herself , still standing there , like a moron . Her other self shifted , cleared her throat . `` Um , I think- '' she started to say , and Patricia screamed `` SHUT UP ! SHUT UP ! '' jamming her hands into her ears again . `` Do n't fucking talk ! Oh god , I hate you ! I hate the sound of you ! '' Her other self startled back , and fell silent . The sound echoed , whispered , pattered through the room . `` Let 's be- '' Patricia said , making her voice gentle , conciliatory . `` Let 's be quiet , okay ? Let 's live with ourselves . '' She closed her eyes . `` Shh shh shh shh shh . '' Just the breath . Just the sound in the back of her throat . No voice . No need to make anyone else suffer . *This is what everyone must go through* , she told herself , through the quiet , in her head . You can disappoint your parents , you can sucker people into a series of meaningless relationships because you 're afraid to be alone . You can make people think they 're your friend , you can get them to trust you , and then you can let them down . You can be a worthless waste of life who systematically makes things worse for all the normal happy people you come into contact with . But only you can hurt yourself like this . Only you can damn yourself to hell . Everyone walking through their door and finding themselves waiting for them . *What did normal people do* , Patricia wondered . Was it touching ? Was it heartwarming ? Did they learn to love themselves ? Patricia tasted vomit in the back of her throat just thinking about it . She hoped they were happy . She hoped that heaven made sense for other people . She hoped that - A shoe slammed into her face , busting open her lip , and she tasted blood and gravel , felt something scrape hard against her teeth , her jaw , the front of her skull . The back of her head was driven against the wall and she heard something crack . Her head collapsed against the floor , her mouth open and leaking , and a foot hit her in her stomach , in her kidneys . She realized she was screaming , a strangled squeaking sound coming through spit and blood . Her other self was screaming too , words this time , `` Fuck you ! Fuck you ! Fuck you ! '' Dimly , Patricia thought she did n't sound as bad when she was screaming . `` You piece of shit ! '' her other self said , dissolving into jagged sobs . `` You treated me like shit our whole life ! '' Another kick in the gut . Patricia curled up instinctively , and the foot popped loose some of the buttons in her spine . She 'd pissed herself . She was choking on something . `` And even now you do n't have the fucking decency to listen to me ! To just- ! '' There was a weight on her . There were fingers clawing out her eyes . There were fingers around her throat . `` I hate you ! '' It was a scream , it was a whine , it was a drawn-out sob squeaking at the back of her throat . `` Hate you ! I hate you ! '' Patrica opened her eyes to see light fading into black , tried to breath and could n't . *Thank god* , she thought , as the hands tightened around her throat , choking the life out of her . *Thank god , thank god , thank god . At least she gets to let it out* , was the last thought swirling through her mind . *At least I get what I deserve . *
“ It ’ s going to be mom , no – dad. ” I kept telling myself repeatedly . I fidgeted and tried not to immediately see who was walking towards me . The footsteps were deafening . “ Please let it be mom.. ” I pleaded lightly . But I knew who was coming . The person I had actually hurt the most . To my surprise I found a younger man walking towards me . An adolescent , maybe 16 or 17 . More attractive than me , wearing black jeans and a shirt I forgot I had . He smiled at me in a way that I never smile now . Naturally , and genuine . Ten years ago this was me . For what was either 2 seconds or 5 minutes we stared at each other . How do I explain myself ? I just wanted to tell him how sorry I was . What I had done to this kid . But before I could speak he started . “ This was a point in life where I could have branched off into a dozen different directions. ” His demeanor was so casual . I was standing in silence , holding back tears . He didn ’ t seem sad , or distraught . No , he wouldn ’ t have been those things . Not yet . “ Heh . You know , I was told in one of those alternate paths I could have been married , and working our dream job . How crazy is that ? ” I don ’ t know how my face reacted , but he tried to make me feel better “ ..but then again I could have also overdosed at 21 had you continued being friends with Eric Meyer . So it isn ’ t so bad when you think about it ” he smirked . I hadn ’ t heard that name in forever . Last I remembered , Eric and I had grown apart after high school for some reason . “ Why aren ’ t you upset at me ? I ’ m so sorry . I-I wanted better for you. ” I jumbled my words , and tried to say so much more but tears were streaming and my voice felt paralyzed . “ Hey… don ’ t cry . So you made some bad decisions ? It isn ’ t -- ” “ I fucked up so much . Wasted so much time . Alienated people who love you . Did things I could never take back . You know , things have never been the same with mom and dad ? This isn ’ t what I wanted for you , none of it. ” we both stood in silence and his demeanor changed to serious . He started softly , “ I might be standing here . But I ’ m still a part of you . We did go through a lot . And I ’ m sorry too for how things turned out. ” He stepped forward and hugged me and then whispered , “ but now it ’ s time to make things better. ” I was confused . “ What do you mean ? What happens now ? Aren ’ t I dead ? ” “ Well… *technically* no . Maybe half dead ? You ’ re not conscious . But for whatever reason it 's been decided it ’ s time for you to go back . '' He paused , then started more seriously . `` You ’ ve lost sight on the things I wanted , old man . It ’ s time for you to finally take them. ” “ Old man ? I ’ m only 27 ! ” I wasn ’ t sad or crying anymore . I understood now . Why I was here . This wasn ’ t the end . Only the beginning . Younger me looked off into the distance . It was white everywhere . But far away on the horizon you could faintly see green mountains . I had never seen anything like it . I guess neither had he . He looked down at his feet . “ We 'll be over there some day , just not now ... But hey , don ’ t forget about me , alright ? And jeeze don ’ t text and drive anymore , you asshole. ” He looked at me almost eagerly , clenching his fists . “ I ’ ve seen a future for us . A good one . You can do it. ” Before I got the chance to reply I blacked out along with the sensation of falling . In a hazy dream I could feel the air and smells around me change . I felt heavy , sore , and dizzy . I could hear the sounds of the hospital . The beeping , muffled noises , nurses hurriedly walking . “ Was it just a dream ? ” No , I knew it wasn ’ t . I looked at a dry erase board with information scribbled on it . I studied it for a moment before seeing my name and pausing . “ I won ’ t let you down this time. ” Not this time . Not again . Note : Sorry , I never write and so am not the best at it . But I had to write this one .
`` ... '' `` ... '' `` ... You self-absorbed fucking pinprick ... '' I stared in disbelief . He stared back . The scorn in his eyes was quite something , I 'll give him that . Such a familiar expression , such a familiar face , and yet for the first time in my life , I thought it would really kill me this time . `` ... Well ? Say something ! '' `` ... '' `` Do n't give me that , you think the silent treatment works here ? I 'm you for fucks sake , I know what ur thinking . Piece of shit '' `` ... What are you doing here ? '' `` Thats my line , Sherlock , the one I hurt the most in my life is myself ? Fucking unbelievable . '' `` ... what 's that supposed to mean ? '' `` Oh fuck you , you know exactly what that means , you narcissistic little bastard . '' `` ... '' `` You could n't think of anybody else you hurt more ? Matt from 5th grade you kicked in the teeth cuz he would n't shut up about his trip to Disneyland ? Sarah your crush you played with her feelings and embarrassed her in front of the whole class ? How bout your fucking best friend , Alex ? You left him in the dirt , did n't even call once after you skipped his party , the one he set up for you ! You remember Sam ? Of course you remember Sam , fuck . It was obvious she liked you and you used her . You played her like a fiddle and then threw her away as if she was your fucking toy ! Then when you got dumped by your girlfriend , you tried to coy yourself right back into Sam 's life ! The fuck if she finally moved on and found someone who actually loves her , right ? '' `` ... That 's not what I- '' `` Fuck you '' `` ... '' `` Fuck you , fuck you , fuck . You . '' `` ... So you here to list out my sins , is that what you 're here for ? '' `` You fucking asshole . You sick fuck . You feel so entitled that you think you deserve an apology ? Fuck you and your face , get the fuck out . Why do n't you go apologize to your mom for being fucking born ? ! '' `` ... Shut up '' `` Hell , she deserves one ! Who 'd have known she 'd give birth to such a piece of work ? ! She had enough problems in her life , do n't you think ? What kind of son does n't even go to his grandma 's funeral ? '' `` ... I tried- '' `` No you did n't . You fucking liar . You know what normal people do ? They give a fuck . They see their mother who never even touched beer getting drunk in her own house and crying herself to sleep at 2 am and they give a fuck . They see their mom getting more and more emotionally fucked up and they give a fuck . That 's what a normal son does . '' `` ... I tried '' `` They say a mother 's love is unconditional . Thats real fucked up , I 'd say . What 'd she do wrong to get your sorry ass ? She did n't deserve that . You do n't deserve her . '' `` ... '' `` You tried jack shit . Look at what you 've done . Look at where you are . You 're worthless . What have you done with your fucking life ? You know how much a semester at your uni costs ? Course you fucking do n't , you 're not interested in money , how could I fucking forget . Thats a fucking IVY , you dipshit . Of course you do n't understand that either , fucking moron . Top tier education in an age where everybody is busting ass just so they can afford an education , and you stayed in your room playing video games . All that money and time wasted . You wasted it all , you lazy fuck . No wonder Dad hates you . The fuck did you do with your life ? '' `` ... '' `` The fuck is with that face ? The fuck are you look at ? What the fuck is wrong with you , say something you mute piece of shit ! '' `` ... '' `` Ca n't even speak up for yourself ? Ca n't even stand up for your own sorry ass ! Get a spine ! You think you 're being a good guy just cuz you do n't say anything ? Think people really mean it when they say they think your a good kid cuz your so quiet ? ! You 're just a fucking moron ! Hell even kids know you 're a fucking moron ! '' `` FUCK YOU ! ! '' `` ... the fuck is wrong with you , are you crying ? Are you fucking crying ? ! You think you 're the fucking victim here ? GROW UP ! You 're a fucking adult , fucking act like one for once in your lifetime ! And you still ca n't even look at me in the eyes . '' `` ... I hate you '' `` Ooh , nice look you got there , real scary ! What are you , a kid ? Fucking prick , you think you did something right ? What did you do that was so right ? What justifies you even being here in front of me ? ! '' `` Like you did anything better ! You 're me ! You 're just the same as me , you fucker ! You 're just a prick , a moron , a fucking asshole ! ! What gives you the right to judge me ? ! '' `` You got that right ! I 'm you ! I know everything about you ! That gives me EVERY right to judge you ! Cuz I know just how fucking pathetic and useless you are ! You think you deserve to pass through here ? ! I wo n't let you ! You do n't deserve the afterlife ! I 'm going to keep you here forever ! This is probably the only good thing I 'll ever do in my life , so I might as well do it right ! I wo n't let you pass , you sorry excuse for a human being ! '' I lunged at his throat . I do n't even know what was happening anymore , my eyes were blurry with tears , my heart pounding so fast I could n't even hear my own screaming as I pushed him to the ground and choked his neck . My body was moving by itself and I could n't control myself as I felt my nails dig deeper into his skin . Not that I would have stopped . I was glad actually . He finally shut his fucking mouth , that fucking self-centered voice no longer escaping the fuckers throat . The silence was calming actually , which is weird cuz usually people fight back when they 're being choked to death . But I just laid there as blood started trickling from my neck . I was just so satisfied when I noticed the pathetic prick was crying . I closed my eyes so I would n't have to look at that pathetic face anymore and finally everything faded white . Thats when I woke up at about 3:45 . I noticed I had tears on my face and thought to myself what a wimp . I 've watched too much anime if this is the shit I 'm starting to dream at night . I should probably also get something for my neck rash , I must 've scratched it in my sleep enough to bleed .
I 'm typing this nervously , I 'm shaking . Deleting and rewriting what I have to say . But nothing really seemed to prepare me for this . I am at a loss of words , I ... I ca n't do this . You see , when I got to reading the fourth , maybe fifth comment I realized someone was sitting beside me on this bed , I do n't need to look up to know who it is . You all know who it is . I 'm just- She started speaking . `` You thought you made it huh ? You thought that , after that night you just casually got up and undid that very tight boy-scout knot you taught yourself to do . You put your mothers ring and your dead dogs paw print in that cup next to that lavender and feathers huh ? You thought you just sat there , staring out the window in disbelief and shame ? You thought you did wake up , and when your aunt walked in your room you actually felt shock as she unknowingly passed the scarf inside the closet . You thought these past days were a reality , that all your classmates , your teachers , your family , all were ignoring you because of some fucked up reason you made up in your head ? And after all of those wine bottles and four lokos you drank , you did n't stop and think that maybe , you should have died of alcohol poisoning ? You really did n't think that you should be in the hospital , getting your stomach pumped or something ? I mean , come on . We knew that after all that shit that 's happened , the things you ca n't admit that happened , we knew that life did n't stop there . And I 'll say them for you since you ca n't admit . Yeah , getting raped multiple times by different people , self harming , anorexia , bulimia , seeing your mom go to jail , seeing your brother go through rehab and relapsing , you being in NA and your constant lying and fucked up selfishness and , I mean the list goes on . You know what 's happened . We knew that , that was n't it . That life had an infinite amount of choices that you could find , and we knew that we were the only one that could find happiness for yourself , for myself . But . Here we are . You can look up now , stop writing on that useless thing . Stop trying to say goodbye to your boyfriend who you 've mistreated over and over again . Slow down . You can trust me . After all , I 'm here because of this post , you know . It 's time . Hold my hand . You decided that that was it , and now we 're here . It 's okay , you can trust me . I 'll answer any questions you need answers to on the way , it 's over . All that suffering and faking we 've done over the years . That 's all we knew , how could we blame anyone . You missed who you used to be at one point . You do n't need to miss anymore . Just accept . It 's time to go . ''
`` Anything you have to say for yourself ? Or , myself ? '' I thought long and hard on this . How , of all people , did I hurt myself the most ? `` We could 've left the kid alone . We would n't be here now . '' `` But he was going to get hurt ! He could 've drowned ! '' `` Yeah ? Well now our name is never going to be used in grief . Only in times of laughter , people will bring us up , and laugh at us ! '' He had a point . The internet never did seem to stop poking fun at me and my death . I tried to help a kid , but I become the butt of all jokes for it . `` Well , at least those who laugh are happy ! Our death made people happy ! '' `` No ! We 're just a meme now . We 're only used to get up upvotes on Reddit , or likes on Twitter . Do n't you get it ? You ruined everything . '' A grin began to grow on my face . `` Well , at least everyone has their dick out for us . '' I 'd finally convinced him . He laughed . `` HA ! You got a point . C'mon , let 's get to the afterlife ... '' _________________________________________ Someone had better get the joke here ...
I guess I always knew it had to be you . And I had hoped so . I see you now as I was . As I am . As I tried to be . A life lived . A grand death I hope . I ca n't recall . If not , let there be a legacy worthy of song . Not the greatest of songs , no . But a soft tune on a windless night . I never asked for much did I. I guess your company proves it right . There is no one I would rather have met here at the final path . Any other I could not stand . No , this is right . I am proud of you . To know the pain I have caused was to none but me . That is a legacy I can die with .
I expected so many people . The friends I could n't save . The ones I ignored , because I was so wrapped up in trying to save someone else I could n't see their pain . The broken hearts . The child I conceived , in my second year of university . The life I could n't support , could n't face , after drunken night with a man I did n't know or love . The woman I had been with for four years , almost to the day , when a man , driving slightly over the speed limit , passed through a red light into my body . The woman who would never have another Christmas without thinking about the way I looked , the spreading poppy bruise on my temple , the blood on the coat she picked out for me . I did n't expect myself . I walked into the room , and there it was . A piece of paper , and on it , the name of the person I had hurt the most in the world . As I opened it , I expected one of two names . The child , or my wife . The future the child would never have , or the past that would be forever tainted with my blood . I sat . I breathed . I prayed . Then I opened the paper . It was my own name . My own name . The shaking in my hands slowed . My lungs began to work again . It was long minutes before the questions began to seep in . Why ? I thought back to university . Before that , I was a child . Surely , that did n't count . Suddenly a vivid image filled my mind . I lay in a dorm-room bed . I was bleeding , barely . No more than a period . I had painkillers next to my bed , but I had n't needed them . I would have been back in my classes , days ago , if it was just physical . The man who had done it was in custody , expelled , and on a list . I was n't scared . I was n't ... anything . I did n't feel anything . I had to leave , eventually . I went back to classes . I did well . But I still did n't feel anything . I was only doing well because that 's what I had to do . And studying , I did n't need to feel anything . So I threw myself into school . I skipped meals , skipped sleep , skipped everything . I lost 18 pounds from my already thin frame , more than a stone . I was cold all the time . But still , I studied . And aced exams , aced classes . People congratulated me . Some even congratulated me on my figure . I graduated . And there , the memory ends . The two and a half years of hell , collapsed into a few minutes . And all I have to do is forgive myself . Forgive myself for the pain I caused . For the refusal to dull the pain . For refusing myself food and sleep , just so I did n't have to feel . For refusing to heal .
I am sitting in a room far too bright to be comfortable but I ’ m not as bothered as I expected to be . The voice said to relax and to allow myself a minute to breathe before he arrived . I 'm waiting to meet the person that I hurt the most in my life . This wait is taking so very long . It ’ s funny how I 'm feeling like my time is actually being wasted or how I 'm being inconvenienced right now when ostensibly my time is actually up . This has n't really been my year . The divorce hit me at weird intervals and I never really recovered . Well , I call it a divorce . My married friends hate when I call it that but quite frankly if you 're with someone for six years or so and have a kid with them and then split I feel like it 's a divorce . Attorneys had to be present for court filings so there 's that . But I digress . Whole thing was my idea too so why did I take it so badly ? I take a deep , yoga-style breath . Five seconds in and five seconds out . Ten seconds in and ten seconds out . Fifteen seconds in and fifteen seconds out . I never did end up going to anger-management therapy but the few pages of the Yoga books I got for Christmas at least had some good breathing exercises that I could use for situations like this . Or for darts when I needed to chill out . More so for darts than anything else . I just did n't want to be angry anymore . I thought that distance would be the best thing . Hell , the kid was starting to do his best impression of my defeated sighs that he 'd hear every day at pick-up . I mean , being a dad is great and I loved it but I can not explain how much I hated being with her . And why ? Because I was too controlling over my own life to let someone else in ? Because I was jealous that she could drink and I could n't ? Because of her whole functioning-alcoholic thing ? Because she was a total mess and I could n't pick up the pieces ? Because I could n't be bothered to lift a finger around the house to clean because just looking at the mess depressed me so damned much ? But she angered me so much ! I lashed out and took my anger and passions elsewhere . I cheated on her without remorse repeatedly . I could n't handle being honest with her about any topic whether it was fidelity , money , or even my feelings on a subject . I was controlling without knowing it in so many aspects . It was n't until after I left her that I realized I was living for me instead of living for us . I think that 's why I did it . The shame finally caught up with me . It was n't until I started to see someone else that I realized how poorly I had acted with her . If I applied even half of the nice things and thoughts that I was trying now to my old relationship it probably would have worked . I could have saved it instead of paying a hefty price every month for child support . I really should have pushed for custody but I suppose it does n't matter anymore . I hope the other car is okay . I keep trying to tell myself the accident was just that but I know the truth . I wanted to hit that ditch . I wanted to flip and be thrown from the car . My dad taught drivers education for decades and I was practically raised with my seat buckled . So why did I unhook it seconds before the crash ? Maybe I wanted a little memorial on the side of the road to remind people that I lived and needed upkeep every few months . I was awake long enough to look up at the nice young woman who stopped at the side of the road to see if I was okay . I even had a tinge of regret that I had done it . But watching her get hit by a car that did n't see her is something I 'll have to live with for the rest of my days . Funny - that really does n't have the same meaning anymore . She started dating again . Fine . So had I. I 'd done that and more since the breakup . So why was I in such rough shape over all of this ? Why could n't I get over it ? High Fidelity was my favorite movie years ago as long as you stopped watching before they got back together . I was living a version of that . So why could n't I get the image of her and some knock-off Tim Robbins getting it on to Barry White ? And where the hell is this guy ? I just want to get this over with and he does n't seem to be the punctual type . I 'm almost shaking mad at this point . This meeting room has a long wooden table , two chairs , and a double-pane of glass . I assume some angel or police officer is going over their bad cop/good cop routine . I look over every inch of the room for any sign that it ’ s been used before . I do find it funny that there ’ s a wire trashcan in the corner of the room that ’ s empty . There ’ s trash in the afterlife ? And I get it - my selfishness got me and someone else killed . I did it because I 'm convinced that I ’ m the worst person I know . I 'm a cheating , lying , angry person who likes double-standards , apparently thinks it ’ s okay to have a harem or group of women that adore me even while I 'm deep in a committed relationship , and on top of that I 'm a self-centered douche that tried and failed to raise a kid . Crap . I wonder if I 'll be seeing him . That 's something I did n't think of while I was driving and certainly did n't until this moment . What the hell have I done ? The lights changed and I could see a face in the glass . “ Okay , you ’ re free to go . Head down the hallway to your left ” said the newly-uncovered man behind the glass . The lights went back up and he disappeared . All there was looking back at me was my own reflection . Oh . The mirror . I get it . What a dumb twist .
I looked up from the desk to see a tall man in a white suit enter the room . He smiled at me and began making a couple notes on the clipboard he was holding . He then set down the clipboard on the table for a second , before taking a seat on the other side of the desk . “ Hello there . My name ’ s Peter . You ’ re Alex , right ? ” He said , extending his hand . “ Y-yes ” I stuttered , tentatively shaking his hand . “ How ’ re you feeling ? ” “ A little loopy , but ... ” “ No need to worry about that . It ’ s normal to feel a little shaken up in the transition between life and the afterlife , but you should have no problem getting into heaven , provided you complete a simple test first ” “ There ’ s a test ? ” “ Not the type you ’ re thinking of I ’ m sure . All you have to do is have a little confrontation with the person you hurt the most . Sounds simple enough , right ? ” “ Um . I think so . We ’ re talking real people here right . I ... um ... wrote a few stories that didn ’ t really treat my characters the nicest . I always found suffering characters made for good storytelling . I just hope. ” “ Oh no need to worry about that . I promise you the person you ’ re about to meet is quite real . “ Alright then . Sounds fantastic . Loving the spirit you got there . I ’ ll get you all set up in just a second. ” Peter stood up to exit the room , picking up his clipboard on his way out . And then there was silence . For eternity , I felt like I was waiting there for some hurt person to come through the door . Someone that I ’ d have another chance to help . It was actually quite nice , knowing I had could tie up a loose end that I ’ d left back on Earth . My pleasant disposition was quickly interrupted with a loud pounding noise coming from the other side of the door . I looked forward in suspense as the door in front of me swung open . A young man stumbled through , hands clutching his head as he fell to the ground in front of the desk . His hair was a frazzled mess and his face appeared to be wet with tears . I could hear him whimper as he looked up at me . And despite his disheveled look , I had no trouble recognizing that I was staring into my own face . He began mumbling at me his words slurring as he spoke : “ What ’ re you looking at you crazy fuck. ” “ I ... uh ” “ Yeah , you heard me . You ’ re nothing but a fucking maniac . Normal people don ’ t talk to themselves . Heh heh . Guess that makes me crazy too . Just super. ” “ Um excuse me . What ’ s going on here ? I was thinking ... ” “ Screw what you were thinking . You think you get to face some ordinary so in so , you screwed slightly in the past , you ’ re dead wrong . You spent so much time trying to care for others you forgot about caring for your damn self. ” “ I was only trying ... ” “ To be the best person you could be . Yeah fantastic . I know what you were trying to do . But while everyone else was adoring how nice of a person you are , you never fucking helped yourself . You ’ re just some crazy writer who destroys himself with his own work. ” “ But , I was just trying to vent into a creative outlet . Those stories ... ” “ Are tearing me apart . I can ’ t figure out who the hell I am any more when I find myself relating to omnicidal nihilistic maniacs and corrupt dictators that make deals with the devil . I can ’ t be like those people and yet I feel so similar to them . It ’ s just an endless cycle of confusion and hatred and I just can ’ t stand it . And it ’ s all your fault . It ’ s your fault I don ’ t know who I am ! ” The doppelganger picked himself off the ground and leapt towards me . Instinctively , I dived out of the way and made a beeline for the door . Whatever the hell was going on , all I cared about was getting out of there . I burst out of the room and shut the door behind me finding myself in a large corridor lined with several unlabeled doors . Without thinking I opened the door across the hall and dove through . I found myself in a dark room lined with computer screens , seemingly monitoring several deaths going on back at Earth . On one screen , an old woman lied in a hospital bed as her heart monitor shifted into a flatline . On another screen , I witnessed a drunk driver swerving down the road before careening off the edge of a bridge . However , it was the third scree that caught my eye . At first glance , it was remarkably simple . A young man sitting in his room at a computer typing away . However , moments later , he slammed the computer shut and began walking towards his closet . After some digging , the man pulled a tick rope from the closet . I watched in horror as the man tied one end of the rope to a ceiling fan and wrapped the rest around his neck , forming a noose . And as he hung there , I began to notice that the face on that man was all too familiar . “ No ... it couldn ’ t be ” I stumbled backwards and ran out of the room back into the corridor . I turned to my left and ran as fast as I could . Nothing else mattered any more . Whatever kind of sick place this was , it was messing with my mind and I had to get out immediately . I randomly chose another door and ran through , never looking back . It led straight into another corridor . There was no logic in this place . And yet I continued running . Continued opening doors . And each time I found more corridors . There was no exit . There was no way out of this mess . I cowered in the middle of a hallway and burst into tears . I was trapped here forever . I ’ d failed the test and now there was nothing left . I couldn ’ t even scream as I ’ d lost all my breath from trying to escape the ramblings of some alternate version of myself . And now , I was going to die here in these halls If I even could die in this afterlife transition hellhole . I got up in anger and began pounding on the door next to me . I felt nothing but rage now and any sense in my mind had left me . No matter what I did , I wasn ’ t going to make it out . There was no exit . There couldn ’ t be . And suddenly , the door gave way and I fell through the opening . I fell onto the floor before noticing that this door lead to somewhere different . No more corridors . But an office , not unlike the office I began in . I picked myself up off the ground and stare forward at a man sitting at the desk in the center of the room . I was staring into my own face . And I felt the anger stronger than ever . It was because of him I was in this mess . I had to face him . I would never get out of here if I didn ’ t . And so I spoke up : “ What ’ re you looking at you crazy fuck. ” “ I ... uh ” “ Yeah , you heard me . You ’ re nothing but a fucking maniac . Normal people don ’ t talk to themselves . Heh heh . Guess that makes me crazy too . Just super. ” “ Um excuse me . What ’ s going on here ? I was thinking ... ” “ Screw what you were thinking . You think you get to face some ordinary so in so , you screwed slightly in the past , you ’ re dead wrong . You spent so much time trying to care for others you forgot about caring for your damn self. ” “ I was only trying ... ” “ To be the best person you could be . Yeah fantastic . I know what you were trying to do . But while everyone else was adoring how nice of a person you are , you never fucking helped yourself . You ’ re just some crazy writer who destroys himself with his own work. ” “ But , I was just trying to vent into a creative outlet . Those stories ... ” “ Are tearing me apart . I can ’ t figure out who the hell I am any more when I find myself relating to omnicidal nihilistic maniacs and corrupt dictators that make deals with the devil . I can ’ t be like those people and yet I feel so similar to them . It ’ s just an endless cycle of confusion and hatred and I just can ’ t stand it . And it ’ s all your fault . It ’ s your fault I don ’ t know who I am ! ” I lost it . Right then and there . I couldn ’ t stand talking to this idiot any longer . He ’ d caused me too much pain . I was going to make him feel my pain . I lunged over towards the desk , aiming to strangle this clone . Reality didn ’ t matter to me any more . Nothing mattered but my anger , my hatred of this person who resembled me . I wanted to feel his throat close in my hands as he gasped for air . But I stumbled over the chair in front of the desk and missed him . He ran off into the corridors , shutting the door behind him . There was no way I was following him . I gathered my bearings and exhaustedly sat down in the chair behind the desk , trying to sort out what was going on . Whatever it was , despite this promise of a simple path to heaven , I was feeling nothing but hell . Nothing but pain and suffering . I leaned over onto the desk , clenching my teeth , and screamed out in pain hoping that someone somewhere could save me . And then the door creaked open . I looked up from the desk to see a tall man in a white suit enter the room . He smiled at me and began making a couple notes on the clipboard he was holding . He then set down the clipboard on the table for a second , before taking a seat on the other side of the desk . “ Hello there . My name ’ s Peter . You ’ re Alex , right ? ” He said , extending his hand . “ Y-yes ” I stuttered , tentatively shaking his hand . “ How ’ re you feeling ? ” “ A little loopy , but ... ” “ No need to worry about that . It ’ s normal to feel a little shaken up in the transition between life and the afterlife , but you should have no problem getting into heaven , provided you complete a simple test first ... ”
`` Hey . '' `` Hey . '' You 'd think , standing face to face with yourself , you 'd have more to say than that . You 'd think , staring into the face of the cheerful man you were , you could apologize for throwing that happiness away . Maybe you could hug yourself , or shake hands at the least . As soon as I found out I 'd need to be forgiven , I knew who it would be . I thought it would be her . For sure I thought it would be her . I would see her and she would cry , and I would cry and we would hug , or she would hit me , or we 'd make love on the floor like we did n't do enough when we were alive . But I was wrong . I never liked being wrong . I knew I had to say something . But before I did , he spoke first . `` Was it worth it ? '' I was going to ask him what he was talking about , but that would have just wasted time . So I answered . `` No . '' `` Than why did n't you just move on ? '' Because I could n't love another woman . Because I did n't think another woman could love me . Because I knew I would never be able to look at someone else and not just see her staring back at me . But I could n't say any of that . `` I do n't know ... '' `` It 's not what she would have wanted . '' `` I know . '' I missed her more than anything in my life , and now ... in my death ... My heart skipped a beat , if it was still technically beating , as the realization hit me , `` ... Is she here.. ? '' `` Yeah . ''
They say that death is quick . Boy what a humdinger that one was . I knew the moment I had died , I knew it with a self assurance that rocked me to the very core . Sure I had thought about it a lot over the years . How would I finally meet my maker ? The truth was , I never expected it to be at three in the morning on a Saturday night trying to drive my drunk ass friends home . They always talked about the light , that guiding light you 're supposed to follow to lead you into Heaven . Well I never really believed in a heaven or a hell . I always figured when I bit the dust I would be just that . Dust . Apparently I was wrong . As I stood in front of the admissions officer I could n't help but wonder why the hell it looked so much like a college ... `` Well Stormy , it says here you 've done your necessary time and you 're attempting to apply to Heaven . '' The officer shuffled some paper work and pulled up a folder holding it out for me . I took it and waited for him to continue . `` The next step of the process is your interview . You 'll be meeting the person you hurt worst in life . To continue , you must face them and learn from your failures . '' That was a chilling thought in and of itself . Who had I hurt worst in my life ? My family ? I did n't have the answer to that . The Officer stood up and headed towards a door behind him , allowing me to enter before closing the door behind me . The room was well lit and I was more then a little surprised to find myself sitting behind the desk . It was n't the way I looked when I died , it was the man I wanted to be . Strong , fit , healthy . A refined touch of gray lay across his temples and his hair was cut close to his head . `` Come , sit . We 've much to discuss . '' He motioned for the chair in front of him as he pushed a stack of papers to the side . `` Umm ... I do n't know what 's happening ... I mean , I know we had issues , but I do n't think I ever really hurt myself ? '' `` No , that 's the part you do n't understand . You hurt yourself more then you 'd ever be willing to admit . You hurt us far more then you hurt any other person in the world . '' I moved to the chair then and sat with a dull thump . I clutched the folder to my chest like some sort of armor , wanting to ward off this conversation . To forget that this man knew everything about me , every intimate detail , every sin , every thought . `` I tried to kill us ... '' I said meekly , the thought of that belt around my neck and the tears in my eyes came back in a vivid flash . `` You did . You hated us . You always put yourself behind everyone else , always belittled yourself when others saw the best in you . You bore the weight of the world on your shoulders when people were more then willing to carry the burden with you . '' He shook his head and pulled his classes off . Setting them carefully on the table I could see the tears in his eyes and knew they were mirrored in my own . He was right . I may not have hurt myself physically but I could never live up to my own judgement . I was never enough even for myself . `` You got better near the end , figured out that life was n't about living up to some insane standard . But you never got to the point you could have been . You never had confidence or understood that others were just as flawed as you were . '' His smile creased his face , causing light crows feet to form around his eyes . `` They say your story never ends , and I 'm here to tell you that yours is n't ending yet . This is just a pitstop , a little break before you go onto the next chapter . '' He stood then and offered me his hand . I took it without hesitation and stood , following him past the desk and to the next door . `` This is n't an end , but a beginning . '' He threw the door open and shoved me through without hesitation . All I saw was darkness . The absolute darkness that light has n't touched ever . I thought for a moment I was in hell until I heard a voice , to loud , yell PUSH !
At first , I was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of emotion . I felt like I was being flooded with a wave of warmth and joy that I had never experienced before . I was so taken aback that I almost forgot to thank the person who had donated it . But as I began to explore this newfound emotion , I realized that it was something that I had been missing all along . I felt lighter , more energized , and more alive than I had ever felt before . I started to use the donated happiness to fuel my days . I found myself smiling more , laughing more , and feeling more connected to the world around me . I was able to appreciate the beauty of life in a way that I had never been able to before . The donated happiness changed my life in ways that I could never have imagined . I am forever grateful to the person who donated it , and I will never forget the gift that they gave me .

The sun was setting , casting a golden hue over the horizon . Its rays glinted off the lake , creating a beautiful sight . The birds sang their evening song , a chorus of joy and peace . The wind rustled through the trees , a gentle whisper of life . The sky was a deep blue , fading to a soft pink . The air was still , a moment of perfect tranquility . The world seemed to pause , a moment of pure serenity . A single tear rolled down her cheek , a sign of her sorrow . She had lost so much , yet still she held on . Hope .

Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere . She was an only child and her parents were always busy working , so she spent most of her time alone . One day , Sarah decided to explore the nearby woods . She had heard stories of a mysterious creature that lived in the woods , but she was determined to find out if it was true . As she ventured deeper into the woods , she noticed a strange light coming from a clearing . She cautiously approached the light and saw a beautiful creature with wings and a long tail . It was a dragon ! Sarah was amazed and scared at the same time . She slowly backed away , but the dragon spoke to her in a gentle voice . It told her that it was lonely and wanted a friend .

I had been living in this city for as long as I could remember . It was a place full of people with extraordinary powers , and everyone was ranked according to how powerful they were . I was the highest ranked person in the city , but no one knew what my power was . I had always kept my power a secret , not wanting to draw attention to myself . I had seen what happened to people who revealed their powers , and I was determined to stay out of the spotlight . But then one day , something changed . A new person had arrived in the city , and they were ranked higher than me . Everyone was talking about them , and I knew that if I did n't do something soon , I would lose my place at the top .

I won last year 's championship by going back to April 30th , 1945 . I knew that Hitler was hiding in his bunker , so I had to come up with a plan to get close enough to him to kill him . First , I disguised myself as a German soldier and infiltrated the bunker . Once inside , I made my way to Hitler 's room and waited for him to arrive . When he did , I was ready . I had a special device that I had created that allowed me to freeze time for a few seconds . I used this to my advantage and quickly pulled out my gun and shot Hitler . The judges were impressed by my ingenuity and awarded me the championship . I was proud to have won and to have been able to put an end to one of the most evil men in history .

I won last year 's time travel competition by going back to April 20th , 1945 and killing Hitler in a way that had never been done before .

I won the championship last year by taking a rather unconventional approach to killing Hitler . Rather than trying to take him out with a gun or a bomb , I decided to use the power of time travel to my advantage . I traveled back to the year 1933 , when Hitler was just beginning to rise to power . I then used my knowledge of history to manipulate events in such a way that Hitler 's rise to power was thwarted . I spread false rumors , sabotaged his political campaigns , and even convinced key figures in the Nazi party to abandon Hitler and his cause . By the time I had finished , Hitler had been completely removed from power and the Nazi party had been disbanded . It was a victory for me , and a victory for the world . I had used my knowledge of history and my powers of time travel to prevent one of the darkest chapters of human history from ever occurring .

Last year , I decided to take a different approach to killing Hitler . Rather than going back in time and shooting him , I decided to use a bit of creative subterfuge . My plan was to go back to the year 1933 , when Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany . I knew that he was a fan of classical music , so I decided to disguise myself as a famous conductor and orchestrate a concert in his honor . I gathered a small orchestra and we rehearsed a special piece of music that I had written . It was designed to make Hitler feel relaxed and happy , but it also contained a hidden frequency that would cause him to experience a fatal heart attack . On the night of the concert , I conducted the orchestra and Hitler was in the audience . As the music began to play , I could see the effect it was having on him . He was smiling and tapping his feet . But then , as the song reached its climax , Hitler suddenly clutched his chest and collapsed . It was a heart attack , and he was dead . The audience was in shock , but I knew that I had won the championship . I had killed Hitler in a way that no one had ever done before , and I had done it without firing a single shot .

I won last year 's championship by coming up with a creative and difficult plan to kill Hitler . My plan was to travel back to the year 1933 , when Hitler was appointed as Chancellor of Germany . I knew that if I could somehow get close enough to him , I could kill him before he had a chance to start World War II .

Once I was in , I was able to get close enough to Hitler to assassinate him . I waited until Hitler was alone in his office and then I pulled out a gun and shot him . It was a difficult and risky plan , but it worked . I was able to escape without being caught and I was declared the champion of the time travel killing Hitler competition .

She had a feeling that there was something out there , something that she was meant to find . As Eliza walked through the streets of Evergreen , she noticed a strange figure lurking in the shadows . She stopped and stared , wondering who it was and what they were doing there . Suddenly , the figure stepped out of the shadows and into the light . It was a tall , thin man with a long , grey beard and piercing blue eyes . He smiled at Eliza and said , “ You are looking for something , aren ’ t you ? ” Eliza nodded , unsure of what to say . “ Come with me , ” the man said . “ I can help you find what you are looking for. ” Eliza hesitated for a moment , but then she followed the man .

Prologue . The sun had just begun to set , casting its orange and pink hues across the sky . The air was still and silent , save for the occasional chirp of a bird or rustle of the wind through the trees . It was a peaceful evening , one that was often enjoyed by the citizens of the small town of Redwood . But this evening was different . Tonight , something was stirring in the shadows . The townspeople had begun to notice strange occurrences around the town . Lights flickering , strange noises coming from the woods , and a feeling of unease that seemed to linger in the air . No one knew what was causing these strange events , but everyone was on edge . The townspeople had gathered in the town square , discussing the mysterious happenings and trying to come up with a solution . But before they could come to any conclusions , a figure stepped out of the shadows . It was a tall , thin man with pale skin and dark eyes . He was dressed in a long black coat and a wide-brimmed hat . The man stood in the center of the square , his gaze sweeping over the crowd . No one spoke . No one moved . Everyone was too afraid to do anything . Finally , the man spoke . `` My name is Lucius , '' he said in a deep , raspy voice . `` I have come to this town to fulfill a prophecy . A prophecy that will change the fate of this world forever . '' The townspeople stared at Lucius in disbelief . What did he mean ? What prophecy ? Lucius smiled , as if he could read their minds . `` The prophecy tells of a great darkness that will consume this world , '' he continued . `` A darkness that will bring destruction and chaos . Unless someone is brave enough to stand up and fight it . '' The townspeople looked at each other in confusion . What was Lucius talking about ? `` I have come to this town to find the one who will fulfill the prophecy , '' Lucius said . `` The one who will be the hero this world needs . '' The townspeople looked around , searching for the hero Lucius was talking about . But no one stepped forward . Finally , Lucius spoke again . `` I have chosen you , '' he said , pointing to a young man in the crowd .
The city was bustling with activity , as it always was . People of all shapes and sizes moved about , and the air was filled with the hum of their conversations . But beneath the surface of the city was something far more sinister . Everyone in the city had some kind of power . Some could move objects with their minds , some could control electricity , and some could sense things that others could n't . But the most powerful of them all was the one at the top of the ranks : me . No one knew what my power was . I kept it a secret , for fear of what would happen if others found out . I was the most powerful person in the city , and I had to keep it that way . But there was a problem . People in the city were ranked according to their power , and if someone of a lower rank killed someone of a higher rank , they would gain their rank . This meant that anyone could come after me , and if they succeeded , they would become the most powerful person in the city . I had to stay one step ahead of them . I had to use my power in ways that no one else could . I had to be creative and think of new ways to use my power to protect myself . I had to stay at the top . And so I did . I used my power to stay ahead of the others , and I never let anyone know what it was . I kept myself safe , and I kept the city safe . I was the most powerful person in the city , and no one knew why .
It had been five years since I moved to this city , and I had been able to keep my secret safe . I was the most powerful person in the city , and yet no one knew what my power was .

I won the championship last year by going back to April 20th , 1945 , the day of Hitler 's birthday . I had to be creative and think outside the box , so I decided to take a different approach . Instead of trying to kill Hitler , I decided to make him laugh . I knew that Hitler was a fan of slapstick comedy , so I put on a show for him . I dressed up as a clown and performed a series of silly skits and jokes that were sure to make him chuckle . It worked . Hitler laughed so hard that he was in tears . He was so amused that he offered me a job as his personal court jester . I accepted the offer , and spent the next few months entertaining Hitler with my antics . At the end of the year , I had won the championship by making Hitler laugh . It was an unorthodox approach , but it worked .

The city was bustling with activity as always , but today was different . Everyone was on edge , as if they were waiting for something . I had been living in this city for as long as I could remember , but never had I seen such tension . I soon found out why . It had been announced that the rankings of the citizens had been updated . Everyone was ranked according to their power , with the most powerful being at the top . To my surprise , I was at the top . At first , I was confused . I had never had any powers , so how could I be at the top ? It seemed like everyone in the city had some kind of power , while I had nothing . But then I realized something . No one knew what my power was . I had been living in the city for so long , yet no one had been able to figure out what my power was . It was like I was invisible . And then I knew . I had the power of invisibility . I could go anywhere and no one would know I was there . I could see and hear everything , but no one could see or hear me . With this newfound power , I had an advantage over everyone else in the city . I could go anywhere and do anything without anyone knowing . I could even kill someone of higher rank and take their place . But I chose not to . I wanted to use my power for good , not for evil . I wanted to help the people of the city , not hurt them . So I stayed in my place , using my power to help those in need . I watched over the city , keeping it safe from any harm . I was the invisible guardian of the city , and no one knew my secret .

I had been at the top for as long as anyone could remember , and no one had ever been able to challenge me . I kept my power a secret , never revealing it to anyone . I knew that if I did , I would be a target . People could kill someone of a higher rank and take their place , and I was sure that someone would try to do that to me if they knew what my power was . So I kept my power hidden , and I kept my place at the top . I watched as the rankings shifted and changed , as people challenged each other and rose or fell in the rankings . But no one ever challenged me . One day , a young man appeared in the city . He was powerful , but he was still far below me in the rankings . He declared that he was going to challenge me and take my place . I was intrigued . I had never been challenged before , and I wanted to see what this young man could do . I accepted his challenge , and we agreed to meet in the city square the following day . The next day , the city square was packed . Everyone had come to see the challenge . I waited in the center of the square , and the young man appeared . He had a strange power , one that I had never seen before . He had the power to absorb the powers of others . He could take the powers of anyone he touched , and use them himself . I knew then that I had to be careful . I did n't want him to take my power , so I had to be careful not to let him touch me . I had to find a way to defeat him without letting him get close . I used my power to create a force field around myself , so that he could n't get close enough to touch me . Then I used my other powers to fight him . I was able to keep him at bay , and eventually I defeated him . The crowd cheered as I emerged victorious . I had kept my place at the top , and my secret was safe . No

My victory last year was a combination of luck and skill . I decided to go back to the year 1939 and find a way to kill Hitler without causing a butterfly effect that could change the course of history . I quickly realized that my best bet was to find a way to get close to Hitler without arousing suspicion . After a bit of research , I discovered that Hitler was a fan of classical music , so I decided to disguise myself as a famous composer and gain access to his inner circle .

The crowd was in shock and I was able to slip away unnoticed . My victory was hailed as one of the most creative and difficult kills in history . I was awarded the highest score ever given and was crowned the champion of time travel .

For one person in particular , it was a night that changed everything . The man was walking down the street , hands in his pockets , lost in thought . He had no destination in mind , no agenda , no plan . He was just walking , letting his feet take him wherever they wanted to go . He stopped in front of a small park and looked around . A few people were sitting on the benches , enjoying the last bit of daylight . He smiled and continued on his way . As he walked , he noticed a small alley between two buildings . He hesitated for a moment , unsure if he should take the risk . Curiosity got the better of him and he stepped into the shadows . The alley was dark and narrow , and it smelled of urine and rotting garbage . He could hear the faint sound of a woman crying in the distance . He moved closer , his heart pounding in his chest . Suddenly , a figure stepped out of the shadows . It was a woman , her face hidden in the darkness . He froze , unable to move .

Last year 's competition was fierce , with time travelers from all corners of space and time vying for the top spot . To win , I devised an elaborate plan to take out Hitler and his allies in one fell swoop . First , I traveled back in time to the day of Hitler 's suicide , ensuring that my presence would not be detected . While he was alone in his bunker , I silently replaced his cyanide capsule with a fake one containing a slow-acting poison . With Hitler out of the way , I then traveled back to the early 1930s where I assassinated the key players in his rise to power . By targeting the most influential Nazi figures , I effectively nipped his dictatorship in the bud . Finally , I traveled to the future to ensure that my actions had a lasting effect by erasing any evidence that Hitler had ever existed . As a result , no one in the future would know of the atrocities he committed . It was a bold plan and one that I 'm sure my fellow time travelers are suspicious of . But in the end , it paid off and I was rewarded with the ultimate prize - the title of Last Year 's Champion .

Everyone was wary of me , and I was wary of them . I never knew when one of them would try to take my place , and I had to be prepared . So I kept myself to myself , and I never let anyone in . I knew that if I ever revealed my power , I would be targeted and my position would be in danger . So I kept it secret , and I never used it . But I never stopped training , honing my skills in secret and learning to control my power . I had no idea what it was , but I knew it was strong . I just had to be ready when the time came . And then , one day , it happened . I was attacked by a powerful being with electrokinesis , and I had to use my power to survive . And when I did , it revealed itself to be the most powerful force in the city ; telekinesis . The people of Cyberia were in awe . I had managed to keep my secret for so long , and now , I had shown them the power that had kept me at the top . From that day forward , the people of Cyberia knew that I was the most powerful being in the city , and they feared me . No one dared challenge me , and I was revered . I had managed to keep my secret , and now , I was the undisputed ruler of Cyberia .
Once upon a time , there lived a girl named Abigail . She was an adventurous and curious soul who was always looking for something new and exciting to explore . She loved to travel , explore the outdoors , meet new people , and experience new cultures . One day , Abigail decided to take a trip to a nearby mountain range . She had n't been there before , but she was fascinated by the stories she 'd heard of the wild and untamed beauty of the area . When Abigail arrived , she was amazed . The view was breathtaking ! Mountains towered over her and the air was crisp and clean . She explored for days , taking in the sights and sounds of the surrounding area . As she explored , Abigail also found herself in a clearing . In the center of the clearing was a small pond with a waterfall cascading down its side . The coolness of the water was inviting , and Abigail dipped her toes in it . A feeling of peace and contentment washed over her as she sat there for hours , just taking in the beauty of the place . Abigail soon discovered that the pond was home to a family of swans . Each night , they would come out and swim in the pond , and Abigail found herself drawn to them . She spent her days watching and learning about the swans and the many other animals that called the area home . One night , as she watched the swans in the moonlight , Abigail noticed a shooting star . She made a wish that she could stay there forever , to explore and take in the beauty of the area . The next day , Abigail decided to take a hike up one of the nearby mountains . When she reached the top , she was surprised to find a small cabin with a porch overlooking the pond and the valley below . She knew this must be the place she had wished for the night before . Abigail eventually moved into the cabin , and she spent her days exploring the area and caring for the swans . She had found her own little piece of paradise and lived there for many years in peace and contentment .

Once upon a time , there was a small , friendly town nestled in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest . The town was known for its peacefulness and its lush forests and streams , providing the perfect backdrop for a quiet and relaxing life . One day , however , a strange new visitor arrived in the town . She was a tall , beautiful woman with a mysterious air about her , and she quickly gained the attention of the townsfolk . The woman kept mostly to herself , rarely speaking and never giving her name . She walked around the town during the day , taking in the sights and sounds , and at night she seemed to disappear , leaving no trace of her whereabouts . The townsfolk were intrigued by the mysterious woman , and began to gossip about her . Rumors spread that she was a witch , or a lost princess , or a ghost , or any other fantastical thing one could imagine . Eventually , the woman revealed her true identity . She was a powerful sorceress , who had been living in the forests of the mountains for centuries . She had come to the town to find someone to help her with a difficult task : she wanted to find a way to break an ancient spell that had been trapping her in the mountains for so many years . The townsfolk were wary of her , but one brave soul decided to take up her challenge . After months of searching and experimenting , the brave adventurer was able to break the spell , and the sorceress was finally free . As a reward for his help , the sorceress granted the adventurer one wish . He wished for the town to always be safe and peaceful , and the sorceress granted his wish . From then on , the small town continued to live in peace and prosperity , and when visitors came they were amazed by the beauty of the town and its citizens . To this day , the townsfolk still tell stories of the brave adventurer who freed the mysterious sorceress , and of the magical wish that saved the town .
The sun had just begun to peek out over the horizon , casting an orange and pink glow over the small town of Fairfield . The morning was still and quiet , the stillness broken only by the chirping of birds in the trees and the occasional rustle of a leaf in the gentle breeze . Josie stood on the porch of her small house , watching the sun rise and feeling the warmth on her face . As she stood there , she thought about all the things she wanted to accomplish today . She had so much to do , and yet she was filled with a sense of unease and foreboding . She knew something was coming , something dark and sinister . She could feel it in the air , almost like a cloud of dread looming over the town . She could sense the fear and anxiety in the townsfolk , and she had to find out what was causing it . She had no idea what was to come , but she was determined to find out . Taking a deep breath , she squared her shoulders and set off into the streets of Fairfield . Today was going to be a long and dangerous journey , but she had to try . She had to know what the darkness was , and she had to face it head-on .
At first , I was taken aback ; I had never experienced this strange emotion before . I felt confused and overwhelmed as I tried to process the feeling . I did n't know how to react or what to do with it , but I knew I liked it . I smiled for the first time and it felt strange but wonderful . I could n't believe this was what happiness felt like . I felt lighter and my heart seemed to swell with joy . I wanted more , so I opened up my donation box to ask for more people to donate their unwanted happiness . Over time , I started to feel more and more emotions . I was able to understand and appreciate their differences . I discovered what it was like to feel joy , love , and contentment . I was no longer scared of being overwhelmed by emotions , but instead looked forward to experiencing them . My life had changed for the better and I was grateful for the person who donated happiness to me . From then on , I frequently donated my unwanted emotions to the donation box , so that someone else might experience the joy and happiness I had .

Her heart raced , her worries forgotten in that moment . Peace .
When you look into the mirror , you see yourself , but you also see everyone you 've ever hurt . You understand the pain , anger , and hurt that you caused them and you apologize for it . You realize that you have to make amends for your mistakes and you have to forgive yourself . You must be willing to change for the better and accept responsibility for your actions . You also must try to right any wrongs that you have caused . After all of this , you will find the peace and comfort you seek in Heaven .
Prologue . The sun had set hours ago , sinking low into the horizon and casting a dull blue light across the valley . The wind had stilled and the dust had settled , creating a sense of peace and serenity along the pathway . As the night drew further , the stars had begun to appear , dotting the sky with a million twinkling points of light . Alice stood atop the hill , looking out at the scene before her . She felt a profound sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of what she was seeing . Everything seemed to be in perfect harmony , and the vastness of the night sky only served to heighten this feeling . Alice had wanted to escape her small , rural town for a while now , and she had finally decided to take the plunge . She had packed her bags , taken the bus to the nearest station , and set off on a journey of self-discovery . She had no idea where she was going , but she felt that she was moving in the right direction . Alice smiled to herself , feeling a sense of positivity and hope for the future . With a newfound sense of courage , she turned and began to make her way down the hill , towards the unknown .
Last year , I traveled back in time to Nazi Germany with a single mission in mind : to kill Adolf Hitler . In order to maximize my score and make the mission as difficult as possible , I had come up with a plan that I thought was pretty creative . I traveled to the year 1938 and made my way to the Bürgerbräukeller in Munich , Germany , where Hitler was scheduled to give a speech that evening . Knowing that he would be surrounded by bodyguards , I decided I had to come up with a way to get rid of them without raising too much suspicion . My plan was to use a time machine to travel back to 1938 earlier in the day . Then , I used some of my modern day technology to create a diversion . I hacked into the PA system at the Bürgerbräukeller and broadcast a message that a bomb was set to go off in the building . The message caused mass panic and everyone evacuated , including Hitler ’ s bodyguards . With the bodyguards out of the way , I was able to sneak in unnoticed and find Hitler . I quickly pulled out my handgun and shot him twice , killing him instantly . My plan worked perfectly and I was awarded the highest score of the year . I was the undisputed champion of time traveling Hitler-killers .

She only said she loved him . John had been in love with Lucy for years , but never had the courage to tell her . He watched from a distance as she laughed and smiled with her friends , but he knew that if he declared his love , it would all disappear . So he stayed in the shadows , holding on to the hope that one day she would feel the same way . Then , one day , Lucy looked up and noticed him . He was immediately overwhelmed with fear , but he managed to stutter out his feelings , hoping she would reciprocate . But instead of returning his affections , she only said she loved him . John 's heart sunk , as he realized Lucy did n't love him the same way he did her . He had been foolish to think she did , and with that he quietly walked away .
Last year , I won the time traveler 's Killing Hitler competition with a creative and difficult solution . After travelling back in time to 1933 , I disguised myself as a Nazi guard and infiltrated Hitler ’ s staff . Over the next few months , I studied his routine and figured out the best time to get close to him . On the day of the competition , I waited for Hitler to enter the room . As soon as he did , I pulled out a syringe and injected him with a fatal dose of poison . My plan was so effective that it was completely undetected . Hitler died within minutes , and I was declared the winner of the Killing Hitler competition . It 's an experience that I 'll never forget !
The city was full of people with supernatural powers , every citizen capable of doing things that seemed absolutely impossible . Everyone was ranked based on how powerful they were and I was the strongest of them all , the number one ranked citizen with a power so great that no one , not even I was aware of what it was . Everyone wanted to get their hands on my secrets , and if they wanted the power for themselves , they had to kill me in order to assume my rank . Many tried but none succeeded , thwarted by some unseen force that protected me at all times . This force was so powerful that even I could sense it when I was in danger and it gave me a feeling of invincibility . I was the most powerful citizen in the city , yet I stayed humble , never revealing my powers and never taking advantage of anyone weaker than me . I lived my life in peace , vigilant and aware of any potential threats . Then , one fateful day , I encountered a man of immense power and strength . He was also ranked number 1 and we were evenly matched . I could feel the power radiating off of him and knew that I had to use every ounce of strength I had if I wanted to survive . The fight lasted for hours and I was exhausted , but I eventually emerged victorious . After that , my reputation spread like wildfire and I was known as `` The Invincible '' . People would come up to me and beg me to share my secrets , but I never did . My power was my own and I kept it a secret until the day I died . Even now , no one knows what my power was , but I am still remembered as the strongest citizen in the city .

At first , I was stunned . Happiness was something that I had never experienced before and I was overwhelmed with joy and excitement . I felt a warmth spread through my chest and a positive energy radiating around me . I felt alive , and I laughed for the first time in my life . From then on , I was so much more aware of my surroundings and the emotions of others . I was able to recognize and appreciate the little things in life , the beauty of the world . I was also able to empathize with others and to share in their joys and sorrows . By sharing in these shared emotions , my life and the lives of others changed for the better . I am now a much more fulfilled individual . I treasure the donations that I receive , as each one brings a new emotion that I can experience and learn from . I am grateful for the kindness of others and for their generosity . Without the donations from that day , I would still be living a life devoid of emotion . Instead , I am now able to experience emotion and to understand the world around me in a better way .
Eva looked up from her desk and let out a heavy sigh . She had known the truth for some time now , but she had been too afraid to face it . Eva had been in love with her boss for months , and although she knew it was a mistake , she could never bring herself to tell him . That is , until today . She had worked up the nerve to finally admit her feelings and now , she was finally able to say the words she had been longing to say : `` I love you , only you . '' As the words left her lips , she felt her heart jump , hoping that he would feel the same way . But all he could do was stand there , looking at her in shock . After what felt like an eternity , he finally spoke . `` Eva , I ... I 'm sorry , I ca n't reciprocate your feelings . '' Eva felt the tears well up in her eyes as she backed away , saying , `` It 's OK . I understand . '' He took a step towards her and said , `` No , you do n't . I care deeply for you , but it 's not the same as how you feel . I 'm sorry . '' Eva nodded , unable to say another word . She turned away and made her way to the door . She could hear him calling her name , but she kept walking , out into the night . The next morning , Eva woke up feeling empty and defeated . She grabbed the cup of coffee that she had made earlier , and as the warmth from the cup hugged her hands , she made her way out to the balcony . She looked out over the city and sighed , wondering if anything in her life would ever get better . Suddenly , a thought crossed her mind . She had not completely been honest with him . She had said she loved him , only him . And that was the truth .

It was the age of the new world ; a world of people with extraordinary powers . Everyone in the city had an ability , ranging from pyrokinesis , telekinesis , electrokinesis , and more . Each person was assigned a rank based on the strength and potential of their power , with Rank 1 being the most powerful and Rank 10 being the weakest . I was Rank 1 , the most powerful person in the city . But no one knew what my power was , for I had never revealed it to anyone . I was the only one who knew my true power , and it was something that I wanted to keep hidden for as long as possible . The other citizens of the city , however , were desperate to find out what my power was . Many tried to challenge me to a battle , hoping to prove their own strength by defeating me , but I always managed to evade these confrontations . Even though I was Rank 1 , my power was mysterious , which only made me more of a target . The citizens became increasingly desperate to learn my power , and eventually turned to a new solution - killing me to obtain my rank . Each day , I faced more and more threats , as more people began to believe that I was too powerful and dangerous to be allowed to live . But while they plotted to take my rank , they did not know the truth - that my power was the ability to control and manipulate minds . I had the ability to manipulate people into doing whatever I wanted , and no one was ever able to stand against me . In the end , I was able to stay safe by using my power . People never managed to learn the truth about my power , and I was able to keep my rank safe from the others who were desperate to take it . I was Rank 1 , and I was never going to let anyone take that away from me .
Last year , my entry into the Killing Hitler competition was one for the books . The plan was almost a year in the making , and took place over the course of two days . The first step was to build a time machine . I had plenty of experience building makeshift time machines , so this was not a problem . I was able to get the time machine up and running in no time . Next , I set the coordinates to pre-WWII Germany . I traveled back in time to 1933 and landed in Munich . From there , I devised a plan to infiltrate Hitler 's inner circle . After weeks of careful planning and execution , I was able to gain access to Hitler 's inner circle . The most difficult part of the plan was finding a way to assassinate Hitler without being detected . After much deliberation , I decided to use a poison dart gun . I was able to create a small dart gun with a silencer . I planned my assault for the night of April 30th , 1945 . On the night of April 30th , I entered Hitler 's bunker and fired a dart into his neck . He died in minutes . I had successfully completed the mission and I was awarded the championship title .
My victory this year was a difficult one . After months of strategizing , I finally developed a plan that would take me to a point in time just before Hitler was to give a speech . I slowly made my way towards the speech stage , slowly and carefully , evading detection . I made it to the stage just as Hitler was making his way to the podium . I had to act fast , so I took out my trusty time-traveling device and set it to just before the moment Hitler began to speak . Then I leapt forward in time , just moments before Hitler began to speak . As he was about to begin , I shouted out `` HEIL HITLER ! '' and pulled out a gun , aiming it squarely at his chest . I waited for the shock on his face , and when it came , I pulled the trigger . The entire audience gasped and I heard cries of horror in the crowd , but my mission had been accomplished . I had killed Hitler , and in doing so had won the time-traveling championship . Now , all I had to do was make sure I had enough time to get back to my own time unharmed . With the mission complete , I retreated back to the future , mission accomplished .

Even though we ca n't be together in the same way anymore , keep the special moments alive in your heart and remember the fun times we had !
`` The sky was a dusky pink colour , the sun had just disappeared over the horizon . The sea was eerily still , not even a ripple disturbed the water 's surface . Jules stood on the shore , her heart heavy and her mind racing - why had she been sent here ? '' `` Jules shivered as the night air bit her skin . Taking a deep breath she stepped forward and raised her wand , making a slight , sweeping gesture with her hand . With a bright flash , the shore was illuminated and the sea seemed to shimmer and swirl around her . She knew now why she had been sent here - her mission had just begun . ''
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Ava who loved nothing more than exploring the great outdoors . She had always been an adventurous soul , dreaming of the far off lands she would explore one day . Ava ’ s parents encouraged her spirit of adventure , allowing her to embark on regular weekend getaways and camping trips despite their young age . One summer , Ava stumbled upon a magical forest while out exploring . She felt drawn to the mysterious place and could sense a powerful energy radiating from the trees . Ava took out her camera and started to snap pictures while slowly walking around the area . Suddenly , a dwarf appeared from one of the trees and beckoned her over . The dwarf had a kind face and gentle manner , and he explained to Ava that he had been living in the magical forest for thousands of years . He told her that his mission was to protect the forest and to ensure that no one ever harmed it . He also told her that if she were to come back to the forest every week , he would teach her the secrets of the forest , so that in turn she could help to protect it . Ava eagerly accepted the dwarf ’ s offer , and for the rest of the summer she visited the magical forest on a weekly basis . Each time , the dwarf would share a new secret with her , entrusting her with the knowledge to protect the animal and plant life living within the forest . By the end of the summer , Ava had become an expert on the magical forest , and she was determined to share her knowledge with the world . She wrote a book about her experiences , which became a bestseller and managed to bring awareness to the importance of preserving our planet ’ s natural beauty . Ava ’ s story served as a reminder that each of us can make a difference when it comes to protecting the environment , and that even the smallest of actions can have the biggest of impacts .
My victory was a long time in the making . I had spent many months researching the most difficult and creative ways to kill Hitler . I experimented with various methods , such as poisoning , sabotaging his communication systems , and even hiring assassins . Finally , I decided on an ingenious plan . I traveled back to 1939 and disguised myself as an SS officer . I gained access to Hitler ’ s residence and with the help of some explosives , I blew the entire building up . My plan worked perfectly and Hitler died in the explosion . I was awarded the highest number of points for creativity and difficulty . I was declared the champion time traveler for killing Hitler in such an innovative way . It was a great feeling of accomplishment and I was thrilled to have won !

The city of my residence was populated with people with remarkable powers - telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensors , and more - that kept it humming with activity . I was the most powerful of them all , yet no one knew what my power was . Upon this hidden power , I was crowned the # 1 rank . From there , the pecking order fell among the other gifted citizens . Moving up in rank was an elusive concept , as no one could advance their status without overturning another who had obtained it before them . It was an eternal cycle of gaining power by murdering another . The thought of killing a fellow citizen to accomplish my goal was appalling . Yet , the higher ranks seemed to have accepted the fact that it was a necessary evil in a city overflowing with powerful people . Some even embraced it as an opportunity to increase their own rank and influence . I continued to largely remain aloof , never bearing my power or attempting to take the higher rank . I had no intention of taking another 's life , especially of those powerful citizens who had obtained their rank through hard work and ambition . However , as the years went on , my power remained a mystery . People whispered and speculated about the nameless person at the top of the leaderboards , but no one could answer what it was that put me there . Eventually , I had to accept the fact that I was never going to reveal my power , or even make any efforts to advance in rank . I just wanted to watch and observe this unique , powerful city and its citizens . I continued to live peacefully in my position at the top , watching from a distance and taking pleasure in the beauty and seeming harmony that surrounded me . I hoped that the citizens of the city would be able to use their powers for greater good instead of for personal gain . I was content simply living anonymously as the mysterious , most powerful citizen in the city .
Last year , I managed to win the Time Traveler 's Killing Hitler competition with a daring and creative plan . A few days before the infamous Fuhrer 's assassination attempt in the bunker , I traveled back in time to intercept and replace his chef , who was responsible for preparing his meals . I had carefully researched the ingredients and meals Hitler favored and created a delicious-looking dish of potatoes and gravy glazed with honey , that was actually laced with a potent poison . On the day of the attempt , Hitler unsuspectingly ate the poisoned meal , within minutes he was dead . I quickly escaped from the bunker , undetected , and made my way back to present day . The judges of the competition were extremely impressed with my plan , praising its ingenuity and execution . I 'm proud to say that I am the current Killing Hitler champion !
The morning sun had just begun to rise , casting light on the empty streets of New York City . It was the perfect morning to begin a new adventure . The door of the old shop creaked as it opened , and an unfamiliar face stepped inside . He knew this was the place he had been searching for his entire life , a place that held secrets that he was determined to uncover . The hours passed as the man searched through the shop 's old books and artifacts . He had been so sure that this would be the answer to all of his questions , yet he still could n't find the answer he was looking for . Just as he was about to give up hope , his eyes fell upon an old notebook tucked away in the back corner of the shop . With trembling hands , he opened the notebook and began to read . The sun had since set and the moonlight shone through the shop 's window , illuminating the man 's face with a soft glow . He had finally found the answers he was looking for . It seemed that destiny had brought him here , to this old shop in New York City , to begin his journey to a newfound purpose . The man took one last look around the shop and stepped out into the night , a newfound determination in his step . He was ready to take on the world and he had the answers he needed to do it . He was ready for his adventure to begin .
At first , you are taken aback by the sight of yourself . You do n't know what to say . After a moment of silence , you realize that this is your chance to apologize to yourself . You can apologize for the mistakes you made , the hurt you caused , and the pain you caused to yourself . You can tell yourself that it 's okay , that you are forgiven and that you are still beautiful and wonderful . You can start to heal yourself and forgive yourself . It is a moment of understanding and compassion that you have never felt before and you know that it will help you heal and move forward .
Last year , I won the time travel tournament by showing the most creative and difficult approach to killing Hitler . My plan was to send one of his closest confidantes , Rudolf Hess , back in time to warn Hitler of his impending demise . As Hess 's loyalty to Hitler was unquestioned , I calculated that this would put Hitler into a paranoid state , resulting in him taking drastic measures to avoid his own death . My plan worked perfectly . Hitler ordered Hess to cut off contact with all his friends and associates , and to even change his name . As a result , Hitler became increasingly isolated , and was unable to rely on anyone for his protection . This meant that when I finally made my move , it would n't take much effort to take him out . I traveled back to 1945 and , armed with a silenced pistol , I found Hitler in his bunker . As I raised my gun , Hitler 's eyes widened with fear as he realized his fate . I pulled the trigger and his body slumped to the floor . After Hitler was dead , I quickly departed the bunker , leaving a stunned and silent crowd behind me . My creative approach to killing Hitler resulted in me becoming the last year 's champion in the time travel tournament . It was a feat that most deemed impossible , but I proved them wrong .
I had just come off a massive victory the year before , so the stakes were high when I headed into the competition . Everyone was certain that I would n't be able to top what I 'd done before , but I was determined to make an even bigger splash this time . So , I set my sights on the grand prize—killing Hitler . It was n't easy , to say the least . I had to devise a detailed plan , enlist the help of some fellow time travelers and prepare myself for the unexpected . My plan was to find Hitler in 1925 , when he was only 36 years old , long before he had declared himself leader of Germany . I knew I could n't just stroll up to him and shoot him , as that would be too suspicious . That 's when I had my brainstorm—I 'd send a coded message back in time to myself . The coded message directed me to a local bar , where I could find the obviously out-of-place , mustachioed young man drinking solo . I calculated that this was the best way to do it without drawing too much attention . The plan worked flawlessly . Taking out Hitler was easier than I expected and I was able to time my move to the day before he made his infamous Beer Hall Putsch speech . By the time the judges called my name , I had already entered the annals of time-travel history . I had literally killed Hitler and that was something no one else could match . Needless to say , I had the grand prize wrapped up and I became the undisputed champion .
Once upon a time , in a world of fairies , dragons , and magical creatures , there lived a young girl by the name of Rose . Rose ’ s parents were both warriors and were often away on dangerous missions , so Rose was left in the care of her grandmother while they were away . Rose ’ s grandmother was a wise and kind woman , who taught Rose all about the magical world around them . Whenever Rose ’ s parents were away , her grandmother would take her on adventures throughout the land , teaching her the stories and legends of their people . One day , while they were out on such an adventure in the forest , they came across a cave . Curiosity getting the better of them , Rose and her grandmother decided to go explore it . To their surprise , inside this cave was a dragon ’ s lair . Rose was terrified , but her grandmother reassured her that it was safe . The dragon told them that he was looking for a brave person to help him with a quest across the land . He explained that he had a magical gem that he needed to deliver to a far away location and he was too old to make the journey himself . So he asked Rose ’ s grandmother if Rose could accompany him on his quest . After much thought , her grandmother agreed and off they went . On their journey they encountered many different creatures and made many memories . Rose eventually grew to love the dragon and they became very close friends . Finally , they reached the magical kingdom of their destination and delivered the gem to the King . The King was so pleased with Rose ’ s acts of courage and friendship , that he blessed Rose with a special gift before they left . The gift was a magical necklace , that would give her all the strength and courage she needed in her life . With this special gift , Rose and the dragon parted ways with several laughs and hugs . She returned home and shared stories about her adventures with her grandmother , who was very proud of her . From then on , Rose never forgot her bravery and the kindness of her dragon friend .
That day changed my life . At first , I was skeptical of this strange gift , but little by little I experimented with it and soon , I began to feel what it meant to be happy . I started to appreciate things in life that I had never noticed before . My days began to be filled with joy and laughter . I found myself enjoying conversations and activities with people I never thought I would have connection to . I saw the potential that happiness had to completely change the way I experienced life . It was something that I could share with others and see them smile , too . The donation box taught me an invaluable lesson : even the simplest of emotions can make a huge difference in someone 's life . It also showed me the importance of both giving and receiving emotions . It is through this discovery that I began to understand the meaning of true happiness . I am truly grateful for the gift of happiness that I was able to find in the donation box .
Last year 's time travel contest to `` kill Hitler '' was a hard-fought match ! I was determined to prove my superior skills at travelling through time , and I was ready to pull out all the stops . First , I traveled back to 1933 , right before Hitler was to assume power , and convinced a young Albert Einstein to develop a weapon that would effectively void the future Hitler knew . This weapon would cause a wave of molecular instability throughout the timeline , making it impossible for Hitler to rise to power . Next , I returned to 1945 and posed as a Nazi soldier in Hitler 's bunker . When the Führer arrived , I kept my cool and served him a cup of tea - laced with a powerful poison I had brought with me . Within seconds , Hitler was dead . My final move was to travel back to the future and file a false report to the time-travel agency , stating that Adolf Hitler had died `` naturally '' . Thus , by the time the other contestants had untangled the intricate web of time travel I had woven , I was declared the champion - and everyone knew it was the result of my shrewd and innovative tactics !
Chapter One : Beginnings . It was a typical summer day in the small town of Willow Grove . Although the air was dismal and dark , the sun still shone through , leaving a peaceful and serene atmosphere lingering around . The sleepy town was nestled in the heart of the forest , surrounded by lush green trees , winding streams , and tiny dirt paths . It was in these parts that Logan Wade found himself on this unsuspecting day . He was an outsider . He had n't grown up here , and yet he felt a magnetic pull towards the town , as if he belonged . He had n't quite figured out yet why he was there or what he was searching for in these parts . As he walked along , taking in the peaceful atmosphere , he was suddenly met with the sound of birds chirping and the smell of freshly cut grass . He had stumbled across a small secret garden , tucked away behind a hedge of bushes . The garden was in full bloom , with wildflowers and lush grass . As he stepped forward , he could feel a sense of warmth radiating from the garden . It was as if he was being invited in . He was beginning to feel like he had a purpose in this magical place . Gathering his courage , he stepped into the garden . He felt himself immediately drawn towards a tall , old oak tree that stood in the center of the garden . He stepped forward and placed his hands on the ancient bark , feeling a deep calmness wash over his entire body . At that moment , Logan knew that this place was special . He knew that this was where he was meant to start his journey . He did n't know where it would take him , but he was ready . He was ready to take the first step towards his destiny .
Last year , I won the time traveler 's championship for killing Hitler with some creativity and difficulty . I traveled to Berlin and snuck into the underground bunker where Hitler was residing in the last few days of his life . I then used a combination of me , the air , and fire to take out Hitler and his associates in spectacular , yet gruesome fashion . First I created a gust of wind with a powerful fan that I had brought with me . This gust of wind , coupled with the limited oxygen in the bunker , created a smoke-like fog that filled the bunker in mere seconds , blocking visibility for anybody inside . Then I used a box of matches to set the flames ablaze . I watched from the entrance as the flames spread quickly and horribly burning everything in their path . Then , as if by Divine intervention , one of the bunker ’ s pillars next to Hitler collapsed , creating a crack in the wall . Before anyone could move , I hurled an incendiary bomb through that opening , directly at Hitler . He didn ’ t even have time to scream before the bomb exploded , soon resulting in the death of him and all the occupants of the bunker . That , my friends , is how I became the time traveler 's champion for killing Hitler last year .
Winning last year 's `` Killing Hitler '' competition was no easy feat . In order to win , I had to get creative and think outside the box . My plan involved going back to the time of the Beer Hall Putsch and slowly , but surely , diminishing Hitler 's power . To do this , for the first several trips , I used my knowledge of WWI military tactics to cleverly sabotage the Putsch and to thwart Hitler 's attempts to take over Munich . However , this was only the beginning . To fully achieve my plan , I then used my time travel ability to go back further in time and slowly worked my way up the chain , so to speak . First , I convinced key people in the Nazi party to side with other politicians and not support Hitler . Then , I bribed key people in the Bavarian government to not help Hitler in the Putsch attempt . Finally , when all was in place , I was able to go back when Hitler and his crew were still planning the Putsch and ensure that key details , such as where the troops would meet , were altered so as to give them as little chance as possible to succeed . In the end , my efforts paid off , and Hitler 's dream of taking over Munich was foiled , if even just for a time , netting me the victory and the title of the champion of `` Killing Hitler '' .

The first time I experienced happiness I was taken aback . It was so different from the myriad of overwhelming emotions I was used to . It was as if I had been given a delicate gift , something that no one else could give me . I embraced it and allowed it to fill my heart with joy . As I opened the box and started absorbing these newfound emotions I could n't help but feel a sense of gratitude . I began to think of all the people who had taken the time to donate their unwanted emotions so that I could have this experience . For the first time in my life I truly felt connected to another human being . In that moment I truly began to understand the power of emotions and the importance of feeling them . I committed to creating a world where everyone could experience all emotions , regardless of where they come from . I am still thankful for that person who changed my life forever .
The sun was setting on a warm summer evening , and the birds were starting to settle in for the night . A young woman sat on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean , watching the waves crash against the shore . Her gaze gradually shifted from the horizon to the ring resting on in her hand . Without warning , the woman jumped up and ran recklessly down the beach , her feet bare and her hair flying behind her in the wind . Every step she took brought a new wave of determination and purpose . She had a plan , and she was finally ready to put it into action . What that plan was , only she knew . What would happen in the uncertain journey that lay ahead ?
The moment Mary stepped onto the beach of her hometown , she felt a wave of nostalgia and comfort wash over her . She had n't seen the rolling hills meeting the vast ocean in what felt like a lifetime . The summer days that quickly melted into night had become so distant . Charlotte , their crush on Nathan , the years of kite flying , and jumping into the glassy water ; all of it seemed almost like a dream . Yet , here she was – running her toes in the sand , she drew a deep breath and turned towards something she was both afraid of and excited for . Mary stepped off the beach , towards the future she had made for herself .
Last year 's competition was intense . I had to really pull out all the stops to take home the championship title . In order to win , I had to come up with the most creative and difficult plan possible . My winning plan involved travelling back not just one year , but two . This meant that I had to come up with a plan to go back and stop Hitler before he ever had a chance to come to power . To accomplish this , I hatched a conspiracy that involved infiltrating the Nazi party and turning key officials against Hitler . By gathering intel about what Hitler was up to and reporting it back to the time traveling community , I eventually identified a handful of key players who could potentially be swayed to oppose Hitler . I then went back in time and worked to turn them against Hitler using a combination of bribes , blackmail , and threats . The plan worked , and eventually the conspiracy spread until it reached the ears of Hitler himself . Faced with the threat of revolution , Hitler decided to flee to Argentina instead of claiming power . By removing Hitler before he could come to power , I had successfully completed my mission and won the championship title .
How do you react ? I would be completely taken aback by this unexpected encounter . I would take a step back and take stock of what I had done to cause the hurt . I would use the encounter as an opportunity to apologize for any mistakes I had made and sincerely seek forgiveness . I would humble myself , confessing all my wrongs , and show that I was trying to make amends . I believe in redemption and I would try to prove that I was doing whatever I could to fix the mistake .
It all started with a daring mission just outside of Berlin in the spring of 1945 . I had heard rumors of Hitler ’ s plans to launch a rocket attack against Britain and knew I had to act fast . After taking out two guards at the facility , I set up a small device which detonated in the vicinity of Hitler 's office . As the smoke cleared , I could see the Führer lying dead on the floor . The point system had me tied with two other time travelers , so to make sure I took first place I decided to take my mission one step further . I headed back further in time , using an extensive knowledge of German history , I was able to accurately predict Hitler 's next public appearance and set up a trap . As he spoke to the crowd , I detonated a small explosive device in the ground , killing him instantly . The judges praised my creativity and execution , and ultimately awarded me the top spot . With that , I was crowned champion and became the first time traveler to successfully kill Hitler . It ’ s been an incredible journey , and I ’ m proud to carry the title of Time Traveler Champion . I look forward to what the future may bring , and hope to inspire others to use their skills and knowledge to make history .
At first , you feel confused . You don ’ t understand why you need to confront your own spirit and face yourself . But , as you look into your own eyes and recognize yourself , you feel a huge wave of understanding , forgiveness , and compassion . You suddenly realize that all the hurt and pain you have caused to others , or even to yourself , was just a result of your own actions , and that you are the one who needs to forgive and accept yourself before anything else . With that realization , you let go of your guilt , and you finally forgive yourself . With this newfound understanding , you accept the peace and grace that Heaven has to offer .

I awoke with a start , the early morning sun shimmering in my eyes . My groggy mind foggy and unclear , yet my heart was full of anticipation . Dreams of glory , honour and success , all of which I would yet achieve . My bliss was soon to be shattered , as reality came in quick succession . The bed was too hard , the room too small , my energy felt sapped away . A sense of dread crept upon me ; this was n't the place I belonged . The feeling of helplessness was hard to bear , so I decided to take action . The clock ticked , now the time was nigh , I had to take a stand . Rising from that room and going forth into a new life ahead . Bravely I embraced all the possibilities , seeking the path less travelled . The journey was taxing , the route complicated and toil relentless . But my desire kept me going , toward the promised land I saw . The hardships were surpassed , the goals set became achievements . Success had come but at a price and I felt numb to it all . A moment of respite , peace in a veil of quietude . Thoughts of complacence , yet a will to explore more . Swallowing the pain , I pushed onward , determined to explore . A whisper of hope , a flicker of life all I had left to rely on . Fear ...
Cautiously she stepped into the dark hallway , lurking shadows lurking in her mind . Turning to glance over her shoulder , heart-pounding fear almost driving her away . Grimacing , she edged forward , a shiver of apprehension crawling down her spine . All too aware of the silence hanging in the air , nerve-wracking anticipation coursing through her veins . Mind racing with a million questions , her eyes frantically searching for a way out . Desperately she tried to remain calm , but her palms were dripping with sweat . Trapped in a state of limbo , the darkness seemed to be closing in . Without warning a noise broke the silence , sending her into a panic-stricken frenzy . Trembling in her shoes , she found herself standing still . Frozen in terror , her mind was blank . Except for one word . Escape .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Sarah who lived in a small town in the middle of nowhere . Sarah was an ambitious girl who wanted to explore the world and make something of herself . She was always full of ideas and dreams of one day travelling to far away places and making something of herself . One day , she decided to make her dreams a reality . She sold all her possessions , packed her bags , and left her small town in search of something better . After months of travelling , Sarah arrived in a bustling city . Everywhere she looked , people were bustling around and new opportunities were opening every day . She did n't know where to go or what to do , but something about the city made her feel alive . Soon , Sarah found a job at a local restaurant . It was n't what she wanted to do forever but it would provide her with the stability and money she needed in order to explore the city and make something of herself . For the first time in a long time , Sarah felt truly free . Sarah worked hard and saved her money . With her newfound freedom , Sarah was able to explore the city , meet new people , and find her own path . She was determined to make something of herself and her dreams kept pushing her forward no matter what . Eventually , Sarah did make something of herself . She eventually opened her own successful business and was able to make her dreams come true . Although a small town girl at heart , Sarah was now a refined and successful woman who had made something of herself in a big city . The moral of the story is that with drive , determination , and a willingness to take risks , anything is possible .
The sun was already setting when George got to the beach , but he decided to stay and soak in the beauty one last time before going home . Everything was perfect - the sound of the waves , the salty smell of the ocean , the warm sand between his toes… He was so mesmerized by the sight of the sun sinking into the horizon , he almost didn ’ t notice the figure that was walking up to him . George squinted to get a better look at their face . Who was this person , and why did they seem so familiar ?

My name is Syden and I live in a city where everyone has a power . As far back as anyone can recall , the people of this city have been ranked according to their power , from one to ten . I am at the top of the rankings , number one . Nobody knows what my power is , but having me at the top of the rankings gives everyone else a sense of security . They know that as long as I 'm around , nobody will be able to overtake them and they 'll remain safe . This sense of security is not without a price ; in order to maintain this ranking system , there are strict laws in place . To move up in the rankings , one must kill someone of higher rank and take their place . This is a tradition that has been in place for generations . The thought of murder is abhorrent to me , but I must protect the people of this city . I wo n't let anyone threaten the peace I have worked hard to ensure . But then a new power is discovered in the city : a power unlike any seen before . It is powerful and able to break the rankings very easily , and if left unchecked it could spell disaster for the people of the city . Everyone is afraid of this new power , and so they turn to me . I can sense that the new power is not malevolent , but a force of good . I decide to take this power and use it to protect the people of the city . To make sure continuity is maintained , I take the new power , and instead of killing me , the people of the city vote to make me number one again . I can sense that the situation has been resolved to everyone 's satisfaction . Now the people of the city once again feel secure . I have proved myself as a capable and righteous protector , one that they can rely on to protect the peace and prosperity of our city .
She said she loved him only , but it seemed too little , too late . They had met a year ago under tragic circumstances , when their families were mourning the loss of a loved one . Although they had shared a spark of connection , it quickly fizzled out as their lives pulled them in different directions . But when they met again , even after all the time that had passed , there was still something in the air that lingered between them . Just when she thought she had lost her chance with him , he showed up at her doorstep with a bouquet of roses . She said she loved him only , and as he smiled , they both knew that it was enough .
It was said that the city I lived in was one of a kind ; it was the only city where everyone had some kind of supernatural power . Some were faster than the speed of light , some could read a person 's thoughts , and I , I had no power . To make matters worse , everyone was ranked on power level . I , being at the very top of the rankings , was the most powerful person in the city . But no one knew what my power was . Mystery had surrounded me since I was a child . I could sense a power growing inside me , an outrageously powerful power that I could n't control . I had tried to contain it , but it was too strong for me to control . I had even sought help from experts , but none of their methods could mediate my strength . Although I had no control over my power , it did n't stop me from being fearful . It was a secret I guarded carefully since no one knew my power . I was at the top of the rankings , but I was afraid I could slip into second place if someone found out what I was capable of . At times , I felt like my power was a burden . I was constantly paranoid that anyone could kill me and take my spot at the top of the rankings . I knew that it was just a matter of time before someone found out my power and used it against me . But I was determined to protect my secret . I trained every day and studied the many styles of combat , studied the minds of my enemies , and most importantly- I trained to control my power . I had spent countless hours perfecting my skill , and in the end , I was the most powerful being in the city . No one knew what my power was , and perhaps that was a good thing . In a city full of people with powers , it was reassuring to know that mine was safe and contained . I was the master of my own power , and that was something no one can take away from me .
Last year I won the champion of time travelers by coming up with a deviously tricky way to kill Hitler . I had already considered the traditional ways ( shooting , poisoning , other assassinations ) but wanted to use my own special twist . So , I went back in time and disguised myself as a German messenger . I then successfully smuggled a live bat in the Fuhrer ’ s office . After Hitler was distracted and used up all the paper in the room to swat the bat away , I quickly and quietly locked the door behind me . For the next week , Hitler was trapped inside , running out of oxygen until he suffocated . After the week was up , I returned back to the present , winning the award and becoming the Time Travel Champion for creative and difficult assassination of Hitler .
I woke up with a start . I looked around my small one bedroom apartment . I had lived here my whole life , yet today it felt different . I felt a surge of power in me , a power that I had never felt before . I felt a chill run down my spine as I got out of bed , as if something was calling out to me . Something big was about to happen , I could feel it inside me . I was the only one living in my city who was rank # 1 , but nobody knew what my power was . Little did they know , that my power was something that not even the strongest of warriors could match up to . I made my way to the window and peered out . My city was bustling with activity . Citizens were walking their dogs , couples strolling through the park , children laughing as they played , it all seemed so normal . But then I heard it : the sound of people fighting , of glass breaking , of screams of terror . Looking down , I saw a group of people , their hands glowing with energy as they fought each other . I felt drawn to the action like a moth to a flame . Without realizing it , I found myself at the door of my apartment , my heart racing . I wanted to fight and prove my power to the world - but I had to be smart . I had to protect myself and I knew that I could not expose my secret . I stepped out into the alley and watched as the fight progressed . I saw a woman with her fingers glowing with electricity , as she used her power to control the fight . I studied her movements , memorizing every one . Then , suddenly , I felt something shift inside me . I raised my hands , and before I knew it , I had zapped the woman , rendering her unconscious . I was shocked . What power did I possess ? My secret was finally out . All the citizens of my city were staring at me in awe and disbelief . I had taken down the strongest among them - the one who was rank # 1 - and gained my own rank through sheer willpower and strength . In that moment , I understood that my true power was believing in myself . No matter what obstacles I face , as long as I believe in my own strength , I can achieve anything .
You look at the person and are slightly taken aback as they look exactly like you . The person steps forward , and you feel a wave of shame and guilt wash over you . You recognize that this is the part of you that you have been avoiding out of fear and shame . The person looks you in the eyes and speaks softly , `` You do n't have to feel so ashamed . You have done wrong and wronged people . But , it is not too late to forgive yourself . You are worthy of forgiveness and a second chance . You can begin to repair your relationships with those you hurt and start fresh , with understanding and compassion . '' The person smiles and hands you a silver thread with a small charm attached . `` Take this , '' they say , `` It represents new beginnings . '' You take the thread with trembling hands , and the person steps back and out of the light . You realize that this person was once an embodiment of yourself , and the fact that you had the strength to confront them has now unlocked a path to healing from the pain and sorrow that you have been carrying . You thank the person for their kindness and look inwards to see what needs to be said and done in order to begin to heal your heart and soul .
Once upon a time , there was a princess named Ally . All of her life , Ally had been living in a small kingdom just outside of the kingdom of the 10,000 Islands . Her kingdom was home to the five magical rivers : the Ruby River , the Sapphire River , the Emerald River , the Amethyst River , and the Diamond River . Every day , Ally processed through the five rivers , hoping to find a way to the kingdom of the 10,000 Islands . One day , her prayers were answered when she stumbled upon an old man . He told Ally that he could help her get to the kingdom if she could collect the five sacred jewels from each of the five magical rivers . Ally went on an epic quest to collect the five jewels required to unlock the magical gate to the 10,000 Islands . Everyone in her kingdom was astonished when Ally returned triumphantly with the jewels and presented them in the court of the king . The king was impressed , and he gave Ally the magical key to the kingdom . Once Ally arrived to the kingdom of the 10,000 Islands , she realized that she had to win a series of tough challenges in order to become the new queen . She embarked on an even more daring quest , which included entering a dragon ’ s lair , rescuing a dragon egg , and , ultimately , defeating an evil wizard who was threatening the kingdom . After successfully completing each quest , Ally eventually became the new ruler of the kingdom of the 10,000 Islands . Everyone in the kingdom was overjoyed that their new queen had succeeded in her quest and that the kingdom was a much safer place from that day forward . The moral of the story is that even the faintest of dreams can become a reality with hard work and determination . No dream is too big and no challenge is too difficult if you never give up .
My winning plan was both creative and difficult — I took Hitler away from the timeline by pretending to be his personal valet . I embedded myself as a staff member of his personal staff at his Berlin bunker . I treated him with the utmost respect and gained his trust over my many months of service . When the time was right , I drug up Hitler while he slept and transported him to my secret laboratory , located deep within an unmapped mountain range . There , I developed a cryogenic chamber to freeze Hitler in suspended animation , effectively taking him out of the timeline . I then carefully placed Hitler ’ s frozen body in a time-traveling device that sent him off on a one way trip to an unknown destination in the future . My plan was not without risks , but it worked and I won the prize .
She only said she loved him . Alice had been madly in love with the boy who lived next door for as long as she could remember . He was an artist ; with a temperamental soul and a quick wit . She was the opposite—calm and level-headed and never one to rock the boat . For years she had kept her emotions to herself , carefully sculpted her feelings in secret . She had thought that maybe , maybe one day he would realize how she felt , and suddenly the world would spin on its axis and he would feel the same way too . But then one day she was feeling so overwhelmed with emotion that she finally just let it all out and told him . She only said she loved him , and then suddenly everyone could see the hurt in his eyes . She had made it uncomfortable and awkward , and she knew she had ruined it ; no matter how much she wanted it , she knew it would never come to be . With a sense of sadness she watched him walk away , and felt like she had just missed her chance .
The cold air numbed her frail body as she trudged through the snow . Blankets of white coating the broken tree trunks , like frosting on a cake . Hoarfrost catching the light , creating a silver lining throughout the wood . Sunlight glistening off the frozen pond , still and quiet . A wolf howling in the distance , a reminder of the wilderness . She reluctantly hugged her coat closer and kept walking , soon reaching a small cabin . The door creaking when she opened it , a waft of warmth brushing past her . Finding the blankets and firewood already laid out , she quickly lit the hearth . The fire crackling softly and coating the room with a comforting glow . The day slowly coming to an end , she found herself feeling safe and content . Home .
It is your worst mistake talking to you . At first , you feel overwhelmed with emotion . You feel shame , guilt , and regret for all the pain you caused yourself . With nothing left to say , you listen to what your nightmare had to say . Your worst mistake has an important question to ask you : `` What would you have done differently ? '' Looking back on your life , you realize that the most important thing you could have done differently was to practice self-love more . Instead of harshly criticizing yourself , you should have been more supportive and kind to yourself . You could have forgiven yourself more for any mistakes made and accepted yourself for who you are rather than trying to fit an ideal . You should have embraced your vulnerabilities and taken care of your soul . You tearfully apologize to your self and promise to do better in the future . You hug your self and feel the warmth and loving energy of acceptance and love . You leave Heaven with a newfound understanding of self-love and appreciation for who you are .
She only said she loved him . Karen was walking down the street with her young daughter when she stopped and looked up at a tall building . Every Tuesday , she made her way to the building with her daughter , just to sit and watch the window where her husband had last stood , watching his little family many years ago before he died . She would remember their last moments together , and tears would fill her eyes . This particular Tuesday , things were a bit different . She noticed a silhouette in the window and realized it was the same figure that she saw every Tuesday , but his face was a bit clearer . As she looked up at the figure , he put his finger over his lips and pointed in her direction . She waved and turned away . It was n't her husband , but her heart still skipped a beat . When she returned home , she thought about the figure in the window for hours . She knew it was n't her husband , but she also knew that it was someone deeply important to her . The next day , she found out that it was her husband 's best friend . She learned that her husband had confided in him about his love for her . His friend had told her that the last words he ever spoke to him were , `` She only said she loved him . '' Karen could tell that the man in the window had been trying to tell her that her husband had known and felt her love for him , but also wanted her to know that she had never spoken the words out loud . She vowed to never take for granted the love she had for her husband , and to make sure to express her love out loud to those that she cared for .
I won last year 's championship by creating a clever and complex plan that even the greatest time travelers had n't thought of before . Instead of focusing on killing Hitler directly , I decided to go after those closest to him . My plan was to use these closest contacts to gradually erode his power and make him more vulnerable . First , I traveled back in time and befriended Ernst Röhm , the leader of the Nazi Sturmabteilung ( SA ) . I convinced him to start a secret rebellion against Hitler . While this was happening , I also managed to make contact with Winifred Wagner , the English opera singer and closest friend of Hitler . I pretended to be an old friend of hers who had been living abroad , and slowly worked my way into her circles . I used my charm and persuasion to begin to subtly weaken the bond between Hitler and the Wagner family . At the same time , I made contact with Hermann Göring , the Nazi Reichsmarschall . I manipulated him into believing that Hitler had gone mad , and thus further weakened Hitler 's power base . Finally , I made contact with Heinrich Himmler , the leader of the SS . I convinced him to start planning to overthrow his own leader . I also encouraged him to use the excuse of a faked assassination attempt on Hitler to get rid of the other Nazi leaders . These combined efforts greatly weakened Hitler 's position of power . By the time I finished my plan , Hitler was unable to resist the oncoming rebellion and was overthrown . I had won the championship !
At first , I could n't believe it . I had never felt this level of joy before ; it was overwhelming . I felt tears streaming down my face , something I had never done before . The happiness swelled in my chest and spread throughout my body . I felt lighter and more free than I ever had before . I found myself smiling almost uncontrollably , and I wanted that feeling to last forever . I began to think of all the people around me that needed a little bit of joy in their lives and how much better their days and weeks could be if they too had a little piece of happiness . The next day , I set out to spread the donated joy and found out quickly that good deeds like that can come back around . I found that once I gave out the gift of happiness , it returned to me in the forms of smiles , hugs , and kind words . I now know that true happiness is found in the small things we do for each other everyday . I 've been passing on the donation of happiness every since and it 's made all the difference in my life .

Alexander glanced out across the rolling hills of the western horizon as the sun sunk below the horizon . It was the same site he had grown accustomed to every sunset since he 'd been in Ohio a week before . The surrounding farmlands swayed in the breeze like reflections on the glassy lake nearby , awaiting the night ’ s transformation into something magical . He could n't help but feel a small sense of joy that soon the weekend would be here and he would be able to drive thirty miles east and visit the rusticly ornate town of Queensborough . It was a far cry from the big city life he had grown used to , yet he entranced himself in his small town environment somehow . Alexander turned away from the nightfall , making his way back towards the little inn where he was staying for the week . Inside , the seemingly endless library of classic literature covered most of the available wall area , with the remainder populated by the rugged and elegant antiques that adorned each corner of the room . Taking a seat near the hearth of wood burning hearth on the east corner of the room , Alexander leaned momentarily against the wall and pondered the upcoming weekend and the pleasant ideas he had to keep himself occupied . How nice it was , granting credibility and actuality to a single book seemed worth it , a worth that promised what Alexander had dreamt of , but seemed unable to ever have achieved . That was when a voice inside his head emanated towards him ; it was a voice he had nearly competed suppressed throughout the day , but knew within his heart that it refused to be silenced . Could he make their acquaintance worth the tale of daring ? If he was to fail , sure would a known failure have caused him less hardship than success-in-the-future success ? Again , the voice underneath Alexander ’ s own provided an answer it seemed had no other opinion that could counter it : taking action will only bring forth a new beginning . This idea struck Alexander , igniting within him an indecisive fire , but driven him to stand and march into the night in order to make his future identity as a fiction writer . All he needed to do was prepare somehow and profess the power of remebrance for all that appeared to have been forgotten before .. What was to become of him never became clear on that night , only hope fulfilled itself in the horizon of what the rising sun could bring towards him . He made his out towards the first tavern of the

Power was a blessing and a curse for the people of Powertown – a small city in the far reaches of Finland , inhabited only by those born with supernatural abilities . When I was young , I still had no idea what my supernatural gift was , but growing up in a place like Powertown meant quickly coming to grasp its one simple but universal law – power upgrades as the lower-ranking units perish . Unveiling your gift gave others ideas for what yours was , and rumors quickly began that I could see into the future . No matter what the truth was , as more years passed by without me revealing mine I inevitably rose up higher in the ranks , eventually becoming number one and the most powerful of them all . My newfound power and position earned me as much respect as agitation and rivalry among the people of Powertown , and many attempted to use any means possible to take me down a notch ; yet none could ever exercise any amount of power great enough to do so . Some , in their rage , even developed the rumour I did n't possess any power at all ; though there seemed to be an irrefutably universal sense of understanding among the citizens of Powertown that I was , in fact , number one and the fearsome power behind it all for no one knew what my gift truly was . Other citizens , though , tuned into my psyche with their sensors and perhaps they sensed something in me ; a spark signaling another meaning altogether ; something calmer and less deadly . It turns out my real secret-weapon was something far more life-affirming than devastatingly destructive . I could control time , traveling through space and years with my unrefined yet remarkable gift that was too great for anyone to physically stop . Fast forwarding , reversing , and pausing certain moments came with utmost control and Command . And by understanding the past , I could help shape a brighter future , ever learning from the mistakes of those who employed terror , hatred , and exploitation . The chains of bondage that inhibited love and blocked growth dismantled because I finally tasted the satisfaction of speaking through action . Years has passed since then and those living in Powertown know no other form of peace , harmony and stability . Each year , true to its name , innumerable amusements carried out by citizens having unmatched command over supernatural gifts . And of course , we all welcomed the deafening sound of thunder every Sunday reminding us of our true guardian , its indomitable power inspiring us to guard it

Martha had been working in the coffee shop for weeks , but she still had n't worked up the courage to say anything to Jack .

Martha found herself steeling herself to approach him . What happened next she did n't expect - but it started her story .

Every night , stars lit up the sky with a brilliant spark of luminosity and it cast a faint shimmer upon the modest rows of lopsided cobblestone roads . As much as she wanted to disbelieve , this eerie realm of shimmering magic did somehow belong to her . Like as if these lands were created intentionally , which eventually answered all of the questions found in her gnawing childhood wonder . The mysteries of the enchanted streets only embraced her with its tangible existence that emerged in peaceful seclusion away from others ever mindful of the unpredictable forest acres beyond its limits .

But he held every single one of the villagers in a special place in his heart , no matter what trouble or hardship they faced .

The bustling city held much promise , but the atmosphere was turbulent beneath the surface , as the superpowered beings suppressed any acknowledgement outside of their circle . Everyone held a power of some sort and everyone was ranked according to the severity and range of those powers ; I was at the top , number one , yet , my power had been hidden from all but me . On the exterior I lived an unfettered life , with notoriety came respect and a certain amount of trepidation , innocent people outside of my circle shuffling to switch passers-by as I sauntered through . Little did they know , the power that set me at the pinnacle of the rankings , setting me among titans was nowhere to be seen . No one knew how I attained the crown , yet , they craved it , trying desperately to move their ranks to the seemingly unreachable ceiling of the hierarchy . From time to time upon accusing speculation finally came to light , suggesting that I killed my predecessor and took their place within the 'kingdom of power ' . This theory only doubled among my enemies , as leader they had a duty to dethrone me , yet every attempt failed ; instead , it only carved away a further depth into the shadows that enshrouded my real ability . But the spark of curiosity could only be quenched if I chose to put it out . Revelations of my talents had roasted the atmosphere , and to finally bring it to an end , not for greed or wisdom , instead , for the peace of the city . I took the centre stage , people around me in complete an absolute darkness as I slowly guided two hands to either side of the podium enclosing my final peace of mind . Apprehension among the crowd was tangible , with unease quickly transforming into total confusion as I drew up the night and banished the shadows to reveal that which I had kept tucked down uncomfortably big part of me . With only a slight swipe of authority people around me have recognised moments of reflection and glanced , for a moment , I was among them and name with abilities ; spectral clarity . In cities and populous dotted around the globe , it was me that held the number one spot , not because I was the most powerful , rather because I had the ability to unlock the mysteries of life itself .... that is , my real power had be the ability to see memories . Every persons conscious and obscure episodes were at the mercy of me , and it finally put
She only said she loved him . Jack had been a loyal companion for eight long years , yet still his beloved mistress never showed him true affection — until now . With joy suffusing his thoughts , he trotted cheerfully up the driveway towards her . He remembered how , as a pup , he had been afraid and uncertain on that first day with her . Over the years he had grown to trust and depend on his master 's kindness . He had been eager to express his love and attention , in exchange for the opportunity to stay by her side . But today was different . Today felt different . His tail was wagging as he approached the house , hoping that she truly meant what she had said about loving him . He stopped before the door , the wood warm under his paws . He looked up and out of the corner of his eye he saw her , standing alone in the doorway . In that moment , his worst fears melted away as she stepped aside and opened the door . Then , she only said she loved him .
The crisp autumn darkness hit me as I stepped onto Main Street . I pulled my jacket tight around me trying to ward off the cold fall breeze that was picking up as the clock struck 9 . I had one reason to be out here at this late time , but I still couldn ’ t believe I had this ridiculous thought–of going through with my mission . Hours later I stumbled back onto Main Street . No one would ever know what I had done , but I felt deeply connects with the eerie nothingness around me . I had been ready to turn back were it not for the curious glimmer in my eye . Ready to venture into the unknown and mysterious and whatever darkness that might follow .
Steve lived in a city that was full of people with various extraordinary powers , from the ability to bend and manipulate energy with electrokinesis to communication with the invisible on the quantum level . Everyone in the city was ranked according to the strength of their respective powers , but there was one unofficial-yet-irrefutable rule : killing someone of a higher rank gave the assassin the opportunity to steal their rank . As the unspoken leader of the city , Steve was known as 'Rank # 1 ' . Only the closest of friends knew his special ability came in the form of forcefield creation , which he showed no one but a select few , nor ever spoke of it in greater company . It was a card Steve always kept close to his chest , content and perhaps even proud to remain at the top of the ranking despite perils that came with such an exposed living . He ’ d earned every bit of his position , fought off attempts on his life and ranking ever since Rank # 2 , Gary , made an immediate move to overthrow Steve when the rankings had first been established . He 'd finally turned against such attempts when Sarah had used her telekinetic abilities to catch Steve unaware and threatened him . After that incident , he 'd forged a celled-position , bolstered by making confidants of those a handful of those within the higher rankings who recognized the importance of adhering to such social norms and courtesies that evolved from such a strange background . Each day brought a new challenge , and that job of maintaining was such a strenuous yet integral responsibility that Steve seemed to make it through without back-up or any confirmed superpower whatsoever other than political guile and cautionary steadfastness . Though Steve may never be able to freely show off the strength of his defensive abilities , he knew that in order to truly be a leader one day would need an admirable aura that shattered attempting views and prejudice that could sink both civilization and entire belief systems . He used what strength and knowledge he had to avoid dangerous situations . He was content with himself as the leader , feeling rather lucky to work the complexities and tread lightly over risky positions . Providing his judgements , feelings , and glances with an air of greater understanding not carelessly or nigh-puppeteering , he forged innumerable alliances . Steve had been successful among the citizens of his city , the watchdogs and invisibles of the region , earning in his heart .
Lana removed her hand from the icy windowpane ; it was caked with condensation from the cold winter air . Outside , night was beginning to descend , taking with it the sun-warmed memories of the day and the bustling energy of the bustling city . To her , it felt oddly calming , like a blanket being considered and cloaked all at once , protecting the world within it from harm . She sighed , wishing she could join the youthful energy crowding outside in the streets . For a few weeks in Los Angeles , the new semester had started and already cut measures had been introduced to contain the outbreak of CoVid-19 , taking away many of her freedoms — socializing included — and threatening her internship at the movie set , all the while presenting deep uncertainties and garnering a sense of precarity to her already home-emplated temps earned . Turning away from the frosty view , she rummaged in her backpack looking for the beginnings of a novel she ’ d long been meaning to complete ; one she ’ d dreamed of writing since the fifth grade , one which had nurtured her creative hunger for more than a decade ; one which still she could not express in language motivating enough confide in a listing of words . A tendril of doubt brushed away her quiet reverie and her heart sank bleary as it hit her , sudden — like a glass confronted by poised feathers ; realizations she ’ d better forced into the sidelines during the day 's hubbub bubbled up to the surface . She felt alone — abandoned and trapped in someone else 's world . This is the real- yet so distant- reality she 'd stumbled into : unlike every young adult again , none would be bullied on bus stops while a prom gave little else to stall for indefinite plans drawn out daily — today by mere lockdown steps , she moved by the inverse way- conscious options fought on paper 's slim headings penned everynight only in bid to continue facing the opponent ahead , her path lit by the day 's tomorrow , and yet ... Lana managed to sink into a sea of pillows , garnering the strength and will to continue her story — the one she ’ d been waiting to tell since forever . So it begun .
I 'm feeling sadness as my time with this precious little one is coming to an end . I have been there in joy and in tears , and longed to make sure every experience was the best it could be with memories to last a lifetime . Despite the sorrow I feel knowing I must eventually move on , a part of me will stay here with this strong-spirited bard , forever ingrained in his developing memories . As long as they know that I will always be here in spirit and that no matter what comes , I will never forget what we had , that 's all that really matters with a friendship this strong . Farewell my friend , know that I will love you always , no matter how far apart we may become .
I won last year 's killing Hitler tournament by taking a few risks . First , I rode back in time on an experimental time machine to January 30 , 1933 , which is the day Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor of Germany . I had a plan in place before I even left , so I knew I had to act quickly . Once I arrived , I immediately triggered an event that Hitler had overlooked and half-expected in his ascension to Chancellor . I released a bee swarm inside Berlin ’ s dinner hall where the swearing-in ceremony was taking place , causing a panicked stampede . Hitler was among those panicked , and in that stampede he fell awkwardly , knocking himself unconscious . This known , irreversible event eliminated the man before he had even began the Third Reich . I returned to my own time confident I had sealed victory for the tournament , and I believe my creative anticipation of the cascading events and careful choosing of specific small details in the timeline earned me the extra points needed to win .

Recently , the outlying regions of their beloved home had been suffering mysterious illnesses and strange incidents of weather disturbances . The vill
Temar Vanderauw carefully laid the carefully packaged parcel onto the bed—otherwise known as what was to serve as her locker from now until an uncertain future . The walls of her pantry had been swallowed up by forest as if it had generated spontaneously from the depths of her living mask covering her own dwellings . Her once barren sky was painted with greenery that housed a nearby connection to various people she genuinely leaned on for emotional support , but had never actually met . Red and blue eyes peeked through the dense forest that crept increasingly overgrowth smothering her space within the glistening sunset of a new and wilder world . This macabre abyss ran so deep , yet so wonderful , it was of practical wonder no other residence was found from its reign . Suddenly there was a bolt of lightning . Refracted sunrays formed a sharp covering over the sky , attempting to relinquish what had taken so painstakingly to create . Temar decided it was time to observe this harmony of progress whilst proposing opportunity for those mustering the will to keep on clawing away foundations despite hostile residents claiming the enclave formerly known as Panmeline , as a vicious bee had declared a sacrament through exploiting colonialism on an even Greater sin transcending the trivial jests of a faulty manifesto practiced by others as ancient scriptures ordered . The packet filled with its contents were non other described as aesthetic magistria , more precisely engraved artefacts from Volkeria and countless little artifacts here in Cresshea–the sacred land filled with thriving cultures simultaneously bouncing off one another . Surprisingly stowed at the bottom of the pack , unceremoniously nestled , awaited a brown sealed letter baring a rapid crest imprinted with unknown scriptures . Instinctually Corrin unearthed this script upon rapid inspection she realized it may have been set from Panmeline all the way Murvek Port . This letter addressed her identity weaving proverbial twilight dragons eluding into the crevices of the macabre . Filament stars fell asleep for much needed breaks against moss covered treetops and spirited flutters of calming lullabies seem to transport both brave Temar and exhausted listeners to a divine realm where nothing really mattered but the will to keep together with those equally concerned . Soon enough memories rerecord themselves within deluge grey crevices moving fingers edging downwards along brush strokes rife of inspiration . All sounds collapse into murmur resembling a sensory renaissance unleashed with unmatched velocities towards rekindling progress
The city bustled with spectators , curious humans looking on both in awe and anticipation . Everyone knew what this day was ; it was The Araldi Graduation Ceremony of the high-ranking super humans - the ones the mortals thought were gods . Most of the young audience members had families and friends that would graduate rank tonight - a shining emblem of honor amongst all those born with innate gifts . Standing just below them on the stage was a single boy with startling electric green eyes gazing over the patrons without moving a muscle – not one twitch from his still body suggested the boy was paying attention to anyone or anything around him . However , rumbling whispers among who stood divided the attention away , obviously aware of his astounding status . He was a Phenomena who had managed level one of the Araldi-ranking system – otherwise known as the leader of all the special beings within the city . Many did not know which authority he had been exacting to acquire such a high rank so soon but… What was known was – he was even more remarkable for the reason that nobody had discovered his real superhuman gift , at least not that the gossipers had caught onto yet . The true mysterious gift was unclear to even seers , as it appears on the date of testing it flipped with some undiscovered intensity amongst its energy bank that displayed it into something beyond obtainable to record . Others believed he a geometer with abnormal sensory adeptness and strategic inborn insight but the boy ’ s actual power seemed deeply untouched despite frequently noticed precautions he enact each time he mentioned something or did a certain about-face move , preparing for trouble that reality was too respectful to give him at that chance yet . A light hit gathered and emitted lighting a spotlight directed around like a beacon , heading into a corner within the stadium the sussmendouts and lens 'd beam pointed to the corner – ungrabbing what made the floor wooden , separating for the ballast were taking uncover and flight fast in secrecy , stumbling across the letters spelt in the low ground : zobres - a secret code containing a special cut forbidden from directly being named by power secanted –but , could be realized in darkness pulled back much like the wooden sheet freeing within spots like line . It then came , The appreciation of highest regard that elevated each manner thought by its handler amunt the others… . They he award precedence heir atop from the fray , coll
Walking away from her home for the last time , she muttered the words `` I only loved him , ' under her breath . Her relationship with him had been more like a possession . A trophy to be shown off to her friends and families any time there was a gathering . He had had enough and broken her heart too . For years prior he had noticed her treatment of him and her lack of meaning in the reality of their lives together . She loved him yes , but inside he knew that the feeling was hardly to be called ‘ love. ’ It was more like expectations she had for him . To dress the best . Talk to people the right way . Present himself as a well put person from their humble beginnings in their small town . But for what seemed like weeks during the summer , finally broken , the two sat in the confines of her cabin and shared honestly all the out of the ordinary qualities they appreciated in the other and hoped with everything they could change . But that chance ran away just as fast as the lightning that had shattered the too humid forecast at the time of their moment . Nothing could fix the faults she stayed stagnant on even if he took the weight himself , but still She said she loved him . Only .
I feel my heart pounding like a drum in my chest . Everyone - all two hundred thousand of them - knows the city ranks people according to the strength of their abilities and calling me out as rank one means they ’ re taking great risks . I don ’ t begrudge their bitter qualities - I understand them from the years of suffering caused by power-mad tyrants prior to my coronation - but I remain even-tempered . Tightly folded hands protect what is most valuable hiding within me – a limited form of Umbrakinesis known as 'Wells of Oblivion ' that I must protect , reshuffle , and transition the bystanders with heave helpings of dust and shallow shadows . The waves of inconceivable distorted force resume hope in an ever-quickening hesitation , setting milestones as situations paint longer or rank crunching strings corrupt priority ways –- keep up or possibly die ; at least that his history section caters for holistically by sheer logical power and compelling force . Estimating fear is a calculated medium quest ; one simple dominance alone might find them dissolving themselves completely to worse logical infinities , if their intensity traverses immediately beyond by measure ! Wisdow of memory adapts the boundaries zig-zag or straight line , all following the feeling of being seemingly besieged without notice . Dodging Feral Boltzfield cascades gives little creature start from landing too much malice , hence pro lifer traditions . There ’ s uneasiness in the throng , either a murmur of pride or panic weighs heavy on breath deliciously shocked in oxygen-less . Canvas towns reduce electricity and warmth combined quickly overcome by power-driven excitement - I am closest people instinctive thanks to well-camouflaged power and unexpectedly each of my limitations proves to a more respected insulation yet again .

She said she only loved him . John and Jane had been friends a long time and they had developed a deep bond . But in recent months something new blossomed between them . John began to notice little glances and not so subtle brushes from Jane as they hung out . As time went by John inferred more and more about Janes feelings for him . They were sitting in the park , enjoying the sunshine , when John scratched the back of his head and muttered out a “ Could you ever ... love me ? ” Without an instant of thinkg , surprising the both of them , Jane gazed fondly back into his eyes and spoke “ I thought you ’ d never ask . Ofcourse I only love you. ” Lost for words John reached out anffold her cheeks in both hands . They shared a moment he 'd never forget and the park , sun and birds turned into a fairytale for the both of them . She said she only loved him , and they both knew that it would hold true for always .
Once upon a time , there was a young girl named Eliza who lived in a small town on the edge of a planet made almost entirely of water . On Eliza 's tenth birthday , the moon shone brightly that night and Eliza saw an old woman wearing only a white gown and a hood around the risen Island—a small oasis in the heart of the blue sea made of rocks—calling Eliza closer . Trembling with excitement Eliza moves closer to the old woman and discovers a billowing bright fog . The woman gives Eliza an invitation to a grand adventure - to an enchanted palace beneath the Island , hidden from the eyes of the world . Thanks to the wishes of her late father ( whose spirit seems to have circled around planet of mostly water still occasionally enjoying the fullness of life despite his fate ) Eliza accepts the invitation . She embarks on a colourful journey fraught with mystery and suspense – the early adventure begins in a grand hallway showing her dreams and fantasies while late approaches her inner despair and at last beauty appears even in the depth . Marvelling at enticingly furnished silver staircases everything inviting and enchanting Eliza explores unknown territories beneath the Island until suddenly encounters a princess figure that surprisingly happens to look and feel like her own feminine figure . Making sounds of surprise – a flash of understanding – she realizes her romantic visit to one amazing place and engagingly dancing Eliza proudly uncases her optimistic attitude changing nights to days but… just then –time stops - shocking Eliza with soundless music all at once while voices whisper `` Back ! cast inner remembrances quickly '' . Doing so reflexively fades wisdom , all reveries but glittering instants . During increasingly unforgettable moments the magical Eden takes shape – the powerful end , love lead a breathtaking conclusion . Eva and Eliza –only twelve years old still playing and interacting passionately discovering refreshing tune and muses . Spring maidens , highlighting seasons angels come to embrace .. Slowly afterdays unfolding waterfall coronation opening long causey passages wall with full of mysteries whisper chanting between purple cucrissand gold pass all growing simply learning dreams realization . Liberating spirit Eliza catch minds inspiring illusions exploring journey light with dark quince wisdom unify kings . Finally mercers and markups cast raging hope which braid fond of possibilities and voyage forth acing beating hearts chants through the rain of movement . It was here Eliza found balance , an epiphany of discovery leads her
Prologue She never thought anything was off about that day , October 2nd , 2037 . In fact , if Gabrielle Carter looked back on it she certainly would n't be able to find a marked difference between it the day that any other day held . She should have known something was up ; in the coming years things would turn out for the Carters to be so incredibly outdone even their wildest knows expectations , strangely enough until today happened quietly into a swift progression of deterioration . That day though she thought nothing of it accompanying her mother on her mundane easy cart errands . Location no in toy four , fresh fruit department had offered little consensus enough on a cooking over with salads such as the date calls for . Grapefruits ( overripe at expected ) and clements ( harder they tug at that skin more bitter the balance of sweet and sour ) , then topache downing avenues as broadwayd breakdown and window staring doting day light practices during cicago ’ s most prominent seasons -- fall .

I decided to take an unconventional approach to killing Hitler – instead of trying to take him out directly , I set about causing a major disruption that would lead to his downfall . Creating chaos can be a highly unpredictable endeavor ; forensics teams investigating the time travel change records revealed that no two attempts had the same reactions from viewers and targets in different instants of temporal distortion . After some trial and error experimentation , I settled on causing a large stock market crash during Germany 's economic recovery . All my research showed that any amount of disruption to their wallet would force people into political upheaval ; thus was my innovative approach . I shocked Wall Street and surprised most of my competitors when I created a chilling spark and prime effect within the German stock market several days into the future . Fast forward six wrong days of instability and chaos sprout ; leading people to commit heinous acts of vandalism , pilfering , and rallies within days . Within days of people going hungry and scared across the whole country , Hitler 's governing orders had come toppling down . That technically stripped my opponent from their claims of victories back 1997 . Suffice to say I was granted the champion 's crown for `` creativity '' and execution of the kill . Believe me when I say : it was absolutely not a pleasant view at those points – but it solved a generational decelerator in full . Best keep in mind next time ; disrupt Hitler further by imbuing humanity 's progression seven wrong years .
Rising to the quaint bakery on the slanting slope of Van Dower Hill , Nathan took into account what made this city so unique—people here had powers . Telekinesis , electrokinesis , sensoria . Abilities so remarkable and yet so fragile were what served to distinguish ranked members of the struggling city , and no one was more important then myself . Due to age , or some such factor I was acclaimed the highest and no one could understand as why . People generally assumed i was some kind of 'omnikinetic ' , though I only truly knew why . But as my wristwatch chimed in familiar jitters therefore ticking near a whole hour towards those curdled sins , I noted true fear—rage boiling from the ranks of those vastly unparalleled—they whispered . Think what with enough strength ! With enough strength all magical humanity may reach heights undiscovered and yet feel wrangled by the grips only fortune allows––with all reach looking onward to assemble faces best fitted to roar—do this and that Master can bow his Head , disown prodigal progeny , face those cities walls with terror draped around himself through whom the eyes consume the crowds display and disorder obtained from gains to total ruin could only grow . Suppose his cloak , oh ! Though each respective to sense their passion roared on their attempts . They all knew me––the current pontiff whom decided within what percentage their lives should brake before titles caved and shifted their way—but In Easing , their failures ; had any man seemed insurmountable ? Behind the cobalt cup served I—did any bear heart of valor wear similar to such black chambers blanket from which advanced authority ? Still blending darkly fit within a wake of night rain swathing the floor below sparkling streetlamps I held nervous thought and further learning true and newfound insight : In all that territory no one knew what my power actual contained With the subtle lightning wash of a single stream the sun glint through quickly reclaim what scarce value had I ever reached victory towards ? Blessed chance might still gulp an opponents elated screams- all while being like a WUNtering blanket aim higher kin may pair others heights ; this boy rain so unclear––there are those who wanted power and hoped for rebirth to he found clean . Steeled slow hero work with ranks accepted time move . Stability assured of course through uninvested knowledge through performances I wholly fear doomed occur slowly start ahead waned pause abruptly
She said she only loved him . Vicki had grown up in a sleepy town , but had always longed for adventure . Every day that came and went was just the same , and seemed as if it would be her life forever . Understanding a life of monotony , and seeing where no passion lied , changed one day . This day , she told a friend of hers that her adventures had already started , they consisted of the sweetest emotions anyone could receive ... Love . This was apparently a surprise ; a few months before , she had talked about never giving her heart away , for fear of being torn up . But today that all changed as she continued her confession , that particular feeling had in fact won her over and the only person her heart longed for was him . Even though there was a level of fear present , something inside encouraged her to venture outside of her comfort zone and express her truth - today Vickie had revealed she only loved him .
Once upon a time , there were two very strong and passionate souls who had been attracted to each other from the very start . Despite the intensity of their love they still kept an emotional distance between them . Revealing of themselves only on deep and emotional levels.Then one evening after the sky slowly began to retire , she could hold herself back no more . She looked deep into his eyes , her heart racing as her soul said ventured beyond the walls of her heart . She whispered , `` I only love you . '' His soul fell into an anticipation not fully understood by him , forgiveness consuming him in a way that left his fragile being back in strength . When that night ended with her hushed whisper , any uncertainty that may have pulled willingly between them from time to time , subsided into a respectful , experiential truth . She said she loved him only .

Once upon a time there lived a little mouse who was brave and kind and set out on an adventure to explore the world . He started his journey by sneaking away from his home underground into the shimmering seashore across the glistening river lit by the golden moon . Nose twitching and brow furrowed , he marched on , day and night , over the spectacular multicolored mountains and looming hills . He scavenged for food , drank from streams , sung songs and told stories until reaching to the capital at the World Edge Cities . Here , he found a metropolis filled with streets and sidewalks bustling with Life ! So brightly colored it dazzled the little mouse ’ s eyes . A delightful marketplace filled with strange sights and exotic creatures singing and carrying on in loud chorus rolled with laughter and merriment . Good smells of spices and delectable sweets made his mouth water , not to mention surprises around every corner . After visiting for a while the mouse proceeded on toward his small hometown but had been on quite the marvelous new world journey . He brought home an abundant toy chest and spoke of his intercontinental explorations to which all his brothers and sisters marveled around the little campfire in the vast night sky . From that day on , the greedy king of the mountain held an ambitious dream to explore the limitless horizon and followed the footsteps of a heroic little mouse into unprecedented discovery and worlds of endless details awaiting unto him .
I won the championship last year by taking the time-old challenge up a notch . Most time travelers usually go back in time in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler and his top men as simply as possible – guns or bombs , most typically . That was already a tough challenge with its known risks to succeed at , so no wonder I allured death-defying spectators when I also offered a masters-level of the Assassinate Hitler game – through the power of manipulation . I started about a month before WWII had considered `` on '' , as the European elite feasted its way through a peace-time negotiations around national borders , lofty future plans , armament stockpiles – the works . He was already grossly controversial yet powerful with a priceless firsthand opportunity at winning Eutopia before the horrors ahead – in addition to giving giant headaches my particular target . Through handpicked diplomatic correspondence , broken social bubbles of inferiority-driven servitude from influential yet `` namelessly '' noted people in places carefully judged beyond anyone 's suspicion ( this one took specialized pre-operation period which also comes in point in time tournaments ) ... the hands . Not a shot round tangled in elaborate disarming mechanisms , no explosions looking the forever door of potential accusation and connotations doomed to dislocate and scatter like frightened birds departing nonland ...

It can be difficult to say goodbye to someone you care for , especially a young friend as they grow older . However , your time together will remain an unforgettable memory . Your companionship won ’ t be forgotten by your friend and , in a way , the friendship can remain alive with each of you embracing the shared experiences for life . You will even trace their grown life if in opposing directions . While their paths diverge , yours will pass again surrounded by blissful times that you had together .
Seeing your own reflection takes you aback for a moment as you choke back unexpected tears . You recognize that the face looking back is yourself , gazing back with a penetrating gaze . You can clearly see your insecurities , your uncomfortable moments , your genuine pain , and all the terrible things you 've done . You instantly feel overwhelmed and regretful , of both the mistakes you 've made and hiding from confronting them up until this point . But then a peaceful voice speaks up -it 's neither menacing nor judgmental - and you listen for what it has to say : “ You have gone through so much and seen both the darkness and beauty of life . You have loved , chosen , hurt , made mistakes and cried . But most importantly , through it all you never question your goodness or worth . You deserve a space in Heaven that is your own because , at heart , you never gave up no matter what life gave you . '' You take a deep breath as tears roll down your faces , feeling relief . You take a moment to understand the mercy of Heaven and for a brief second hope works to replace the regret in your soul . Holding onto that mercy , you step forward and greet yourself with a warm embrace .
Anthony glanced nervously out the restaurant window , as his date flicked her wet cherry curls behind one ear . Every now and then , she connected with his eyes , causing his pulse to accelerate from their intense gaze . Abruptly , forks tingled against plates as the night fell to a silence . His fearful lips quivered , as he pressed against interrogating words . Sheepishly , her neck recoiled . Soon , they sipped away bittersweet tea , relishing a distant conversation they held years ago . Over time , their speech elevated through quivering breaths , allowing a somber understanding they long disavowed . Suddenly , Anthony slowly reached across the narrowing table . His dry fingertips quivered against her youthful skin , sparking some hidden passion held from long ago . His words tumbled through sympathy before whispering ... '' relinquish ? '' . Affirmative .

At first , it was difficult to understand what happiness felt like . Slowly , I started to smile more often and laugh . Times were still hard since I felt disconnected from everything around me but , I was slowly starting to understand the concept of joy . Now , I am grateful to have experienced the emotion of enthusiasm and contentment . Even though some moments are still hard to cope with , having methods to trust in particular momentary joy has helped elevate my spirit whenever those days hit . Because accepting these unwilled kindnesses , seeking new emotions has opened excellent doors of limitless surprises and experiences of understanding true lenience . It has shaped me into this wonderful self seeking extraordinary connections .
John Wiley waited impatiently outside . The dark night briefly cloaked him . Pedestrians meandered , oblivious to him . Then music blared as an elevator 's doors opened . Escaping of laughter ravaged the muted silence . Slow song signaled his companion 's descent . Brilliance of her spotlight ignited the dismal mood . Over long table , passionate words cut like knives . Night speedily began to tense yet he felt calm . Faces once soft began to curve strange smirks . Extravagantly grew every glint of her eyes . Glowing tenderly , softer and quieter he saw . Cross purposes frozen in cinematic carvings . Imagination slowly intertwined mutual dreaminess . Everlasting desire lay itself uncovered and whispered love .
Living in a city full of extraordinary power mutants felt overwhelming to me , as I could n't truly identify or understand my own abilities that had brought be to this point where I was seated nevertheless in Rank 1 . Everyone repeated the same crescendo of gossip : why has no one tried to take her reigning spot -- no one knew neither did I . It all started when I reasoned why everywhere I seemed to turn I bothered the elite the wrong elders especially young scolars trying in vain by their ambitions alone to supersede me ?

Inquisitive beyond his years , Pippen found behind their house amidst broken tree stumps and piles of shoveled dirt a peek into formidable cloaked worlds far removed from the problems filling his life . In enthrallment , nearly oozing off of him , he quietly forced open a thick rusty gate earthed with carbonized time and uncovered a highly inquisitant reality of fire lizards , pinting waters , and mushroom caterpillars meandering through stained parahampers of gold and silver . Giving in to the experience unleashing in front of him , Pippen did n't answer when his mother 's question tricycled back down the world 's concurrence , only rarely able to track her son amidst the rag lands she often seized to anchor feigned blaiffs . With not merely a day 's demands looming , Pippen was nevertheless amidst the cascading shadows erupting no filter before him and no assurance that would react with normal rational procedure . ( Focus on contrast and comparison eistered emotions urging comportment unusual amazement . Wonderland ambush -- take it away ! ) .
Once upon a time there was a brave little dog named Luna who was always up for an adventure . Luna and her family moved to the small town of Moonlight Falls , and here the pup garnered a reputation for being able and willing to trot around her quaint neighborhood in all hours of the day , rain or shine . On one bright morning , Luna received an air mail letter addressed to her from a bird , Feather Wings .

Summer rain reminds Victoria of her mother . Days at the lake , stoking the fire . Fishing pole dipping . Moon chasing them home . Bucket of cray fish to cook . Gutting and tightening the morning set lines . Folk lore , jokes far too silly ; butterflies swelling nightly felt air . Sparking comet in an open sky of blue . Closing her eyes , dreams seeping into sleep . Chirping yonder , love emanating near her busy head . Home was the love of family stories . Durampen was but a magical small town in south . Groaning from younger days just underneath her lashes- youth could n't stay still in that every wondrous season . Joy flowed yet anew each cycle marking anew the lake tinkering . Home spot of simplicity where forever flourish sauntering till in breaths only one ; nature . Beneath .

It was something that Sarah was feeling all week . A certain nag of worry about what was to come . She left home early that Sunday and had no idea that her world would be flipped upside-down by the day 's end . Frantic waves of fear rolled through her body until she could n't tell up from down , wrong from right or comfort from chaos . The rush of every single moment eventually hugged her , like a full-length succulent novel finally fading into its satisfying and hard-anticipated conclusion . A spark of understanding hummed through her core and she knew then , that things would never be the same .

Once upon a time , there was a small town shrouded in moonlight—Lake Arbor . The name came upon it like mist on a foggy night , lending an air of mystery to its snowy peaks during the day and its starry observatories at night . Little was known of Lake Arbor prior to modern day , though it was legend that those who ventured into filled planes soon left with happy tales and fragments of forgotten moonstone .

Kerri quietly pushed open the old creaking door with trembling , poised hands and tiptoed past dusty forgotten memories . She knew it held a secret fear , yet she aware her deep rooted strength had the ability to resist these tribulations . Hopelessness seated on weathered bark wrapping doubts and all things unjust throughout these years . Ignorance eased around wickedness and hatred while struggling to persevere . Pages frozen now amongst voices in despair and smiling comfort that deceived . Life deserted partaking or containing any breakthrough individualism barely achieved . Hunger to oppress and an unchained fire , only the humdrum survived expectancy and delight . Pering limitations and the echoes through defining eternity in deciphering light . Ultimately leaving room for reality revealed in private midnight cry wanderings . Burning cascasing honey covering shame transform empty hope breathing empathetic remainings entwined bridge reaching wounded inner sun molight humbly healing crimson flowers expand until whisper fidelity falls , Peace ?

This winter morning was unlike none Linda had experienced before . The city had suddenly become individual outlines against a white terrain . Frozen whisper ambulated through falling snow and there were places that she could attempt to tread ; faint old forgotten songs drowned far below flake . But Linda had a pilgrim knowledge that whispered there might be personified pauses waiting unheard ; lands that whispered life was waiting to be refurbished in the blue glims against purity surrounding a surreal audience . Subary souls received not lived life , they questioned over answered awakeness with laughter squashing burning flinth residue .

Once upon a time , a farmer named Lukas was content with his small lot in Bridgecot Valley outside Portsmouth . He lived off the network of vendors — getting eggs , vegetables , and dairy from Janet Miller ’ s farm , pork and poultry from Will Farnsworth ’ s house , canned fruits from the townshed deliveriers — and he sold rode ’ ks in bun layers , which earned him a continual and beneficial knot .

Jennifer crouched behind the old picket fence , fear paralyzing her with each rushed breath taken ; She had to escape . Nipping through the small pass in between her hands were shook with dread and palms slicked with nervous sweat . Tense stoned silence overwhelmed her short refuge . Scanning all that ’ s around was temporary recreation nonetheless certain intruder 's jangling of tough chains hindered her reassured plan of refuge Coveting escape into a shimmering light glimmered beyond the obscure darkness . Momentum tipped propelling ourselves forced She gulped deep relief but that 's when She noticed dusky shadows move fast trailing malicious capriciousness of fear Fully awakened by hazard She jerked frightening far far too sinister Advancements progressed in perpetual trifling Shadow grasped softly sweet unknown singing mercy Buried in bewilderment considering icy unexpected comfort apparent amongst considerable despair Tears glimpsed fading abruptly Morning eventually hesitated by ... Fate . Untracked . Released .

Sunlight burst into his retina while the thunderous coral seeped out of the Grand Hall — for it it was his wedding day . Eagerly tottering in steady steps he continued towards Fate waiting faithfully behind temple ropes . He assumed the grace of stoic cheer reflecting off the ever building chanting and jolly waves . Silk pangchitas screened his anxiety away , confidently breezing away beneath strong shoulder tattoos . The smirks from the choir deceived timidity , calming misgivings of love joys and newfound pains . Piped mango flowers delicately scattered like anklet toppings made his thrust all the better . Mundane monsoon flooded the sky like final preparative compliments bedazzling even Groomsman splendour . His hesitant only obscured the sky glaring prowess balanced by Allah promised blessings . Protection… Solidified . Deemarking meaning done . Duty .
